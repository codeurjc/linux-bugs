# Commit Annotator

This is the annotation tool, intended to annotate commits of the Linux kernel.

## Installation

Create a Python virtual environment, and install in it the dependencies found in the [requirements.txt](../requirements.txt) file in the parent directory. There are some more details about this process in the [README.md](../README.md) file in the parent directory.

## Annotation procedure

Read carefully the [procedure.md](procedure.md) file in this directory, to understand what to read before annotating, and the annotation procedure itself.

## Running the annotation tool

Activate the virtual environment used for the installation. Once that is done, run `annotator_ui.py`. The tool admits some arguments, launch it with the `--help` flag to learn about them.
