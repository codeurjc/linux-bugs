    udp: Update reuse->has_conns under reuseport_lock.
    
    commit 69421bf98482d089e50799f45e48b25ce4a8d154 upstream.
    
    When we call connect() for a UDP socket in a reuseport group, we have
    to update sk->sk_reuseport_cb->has_conns to 1.  Otherwise, the kernel
    could select a unconnected socket wrongly for packets sent to the
    connected socket.
    
    However, the current way to set has_conns is illegal and possible to
    trigger that problem.  reuseport_has_conns() changes has_conns under
    rcu_read_lock(), which upgrades the RCU reader to the updater.  Then,
    it must do the update under the updater's lock, reuseport_lock, but
    it doesn't for now.
    
    For this reason, there is a race below where we fail to set has_conns
    resulting in the wrong socket selection.  To avoid the race, let's split
    the reader and updater with proper locking.
    
     cpu1                               cpu2

    |  `- rcu_read_unlock()            `- kfree_rcu(reuse, rcu)
    |
    |- sk->sk_state = TCP_ESTABLISHED
    
    Note the likely(reuse) in reuseport_has_conns_set() is always true,
    but we put the test there for ease of review.  [0]
    
    For the record, usually, sk_reuseport_cb is changed under lock_sock().
    The only exception is reuseport_grow() & TCP reqsk migration case.
    
      1) shutdown() TCP listener, which is moved into the latter part of
         reuse->socks[] to migrate reqsk.
    
      2) New listen() overflows reuse->socks[] and call reuseport_grow().
    
      3) reuse->max_socks overflows u16 with the new listener.
    
      4) reuseport_grow() pops the old shutdown()ed listener from the array
         and update its sk->sk_reuseport_cb as NULL without lock_sock().
    
    shutdown()ed TCP sk->sk_reuseport_cb can be changed without lock_sock(),
    but, reuseport_has_conns_set() is called only for UDP under lock_sock(),
    so likely(reuse) never be false in reuseport_has_conns_set().

    blk-wbt: fix that 'rwb->wc' is always set to 1 in wbt_init()

    commit 8c5035dfbb94 ("blk-wbt: call rq_qos_add() after wb_normal is

    is wrong because wbt_rq_qos() is still NULL.
    
    Fix the problem by removing wbt_set_write_cache() and setting 'rwb->wc'
    directly. Noted that this patch also remove the redundant setting of
    'rab->wc'.

    mmc: core: Add SD card quirk for broken discard
    
    commit 07d2872bf4c864eb83d034263c155746a2fb7a3b upstream.
    
    Some SD-cards from Sandisk that are SDA-6.0 compliant reports they supports
    discard, while they actually don't. This might cause mk2fs to fail while
    trying to format the card and revert it to a read-only mode.
    
    To fix this problem, let's add a card quirk (MMC_QUIRK_BROKEN_SD_DISCARD)
    to indicate that we shall fall-back to use the legacy erase command
    instead.

    Makefile.debug: re-enable debug info for .S files
    
    This is _not_ an upstream commit and just for 5.10.y only. It is based
    on commit 32ef9e5054ec0321b9336058c58ec749e9c6b0fe upstream.
    
    Alexey reported that the fraction of unknown filename instances in

    to assembler defined symbols, which regressed as a result of:

    x86/Kconfig: Drop check for -mabi=ms for CONFIG_EFI_STUB
    
    commit 33806e7cb8d50379f55c3e8f335e91e1b359dc7b upstream.
    
    A recent change in LLVM made CONFIG_EFI_STUB unselectable because it no
    longer pretends to support -mabi=ms, breaking the dependency in
    Kconfig. Lack of CONFIG_EFI_STUB can prevent kernels from booting via
    EFI in certain circumstances.
    
    This check was added by
    
      8f24f8c2fc82 ("efi/libstub: Annotate firmware routines as __efiapi")
    
    to ensure that __attribute__((ms_abi)) was available, as -mabi=ms is
    not actually used in any cflags.
    
    According to the GCC documentation, this attribute has been supported
    since GCC 4.4.7. The kernel currently requires GCC 5.1 so this check is
    not necessary; even when that change landed in 5.6, the kernel required
    GCC 4.9 so it was unnecessary then as well.
    
    Clang supports __attribute__((ms_abi)) for all versions that are
    supported for building the kernel so no additional check is needed.
    Remove the 'depends on' line altogether to allow CONFIG_EFI_STUB to be
    selected when CONFIG_EFI is enabled, regardless of compiler.

    ACPI: video: Force backlight native for more TongFang devices
    
    commit 3dbc80a3e4c55c4a5b89ef207bed7b7de36157b4 upstream.
    
    This commit is very different from the upstream commit! It fixes the same
    issue by adding more quirks, rather then the general fix from the 6.1
    kernel, because the general fix from the 6.1 kernel is part of a larger
    refactoring of the backlight code which is not suitable for the stable
    series.
    
    As described in "ACPI: video: Drop NL5x?U, PF4NU1F and PF5?U??
    acpi_backlight=native quirks" (10212754a0d2) the upstream commit "ACPI:
    video: Make backlight class device registration a separate step (v2)"
    (3dbc80a3e4c5) makes these quirks unnecessary. However as mentioned in this
    bugtracker ticket https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215683#c17
    the upstream fix is part of a larger patchset that is overall too complex
    for stable.
    
    The TongFang GKxNRxx, GMxNGxx, GMxZGxx, and GMxRGxx / TUXEDO
    Stellaris/Polaris Gen 1-4, have the same problem as the Clevo NL5xRU and
    NL5xNU / TUXEDO Aura 15 Gen1 and Gen2:
    They have a working native and video interface for screen backlight.
    However the default detection mechanism first registers the video interface
    before unregistering it again and switching to the native interface during
    boot. This results in a dangling SBIOS request for backlight change for
    some reason, causing the backlight to switch to ~2% once per boot on the
    first power cord connect or disconnect event. Setting the native interface
    explicitly circumvents this buggy behaviour by avoiding the unregistering
    process.

    riscv: topology: fix default topology reporting
    
    commit fbd92809997a391f28075f1c8b5ee314c225557c upstream.
    
    RISC-V has no sane defaults to fall back on where there is no cpu-map
    in the devicetree.
    Without sane defaults, the package, core and thread IDs are all set to
    -1. This causes user-visible inaccuracies for tools like hwloc/lstopo
    which rely on the sysfs cpu topology files to detect a system's
    topology.
    
    On a PolarFire SoC, which should have 4 harts with a thread each,
    lstopo currently reports:
    
    Machine (793MB total)
      Package L#0
        NUMANode L#0 (P#0 793MB)
        Core L#0
          L1d L#0 (32KB) + L1i L#0 (32KB) + PU L#0 (P#0)

          L1d L#3 (32KB) + L1i L#3 (32KB) + PU L#3 (P#3)
    
    Adding calls to store_cpu_topology() in {boot,smp} hart bringup code
    results in the correct topolgy being reported:

    arm64: topology: move store_cpu_topology() to shared code
    
    commit 456797da792fa7cbf6698febf275fe9b36691f78 upstream.
    
    arm64's method of defining a default cpu topology requires only minimal
    changes to apply to RISC-V also. The current arm64 implementation exits
    early in a uniprocessor configuration by reading MPIDR & claiming that
    uniprocessor can rely on the default values.
    
    This is appears to be a hangover from prior to '3102bc0e6ac7 ("arm64:
    topology: Stop using MPIDR for topology information")', because the
    current code just assigns default values for multiprocessor systems.
    
    With the MPIDR references removed, store_cpu_topolgy() can be moved to
    the common arch_topology code.

    fcntl: fix potential deadlocks for &fown_struct.lock
    
    [ Upstream commit f671a691e299f58835d4660d642582bf0e8f6fda ]
    
    Syzbot reports a potential deadlock in do_fcntl:
    
    ========================================================
    WARNING: possible irq lock inversion dependency detected
    5.12.0-syzkaller #0 Not tainted
    --------------------------------------------------------
    syz-executor132/8391 just changed the state of lock:
    ffff888015967bf8 (&f->f_owner.lock){.+..}-{2:2}, at: f_getown_ex fs/fcntl.c:211 [inline]
    ffff888015967bf8 (&f->f_owner.lock){.+..}-{2:2}, at: do_fcntl+0x8b4/0x1200 fs/fcntl.c:395
    but this lock was taken by another, HARDIRQ-safe lock in the past:
     (&dev->event_lock){-...}-{2:2}
    
    and interrupts could create inverse lock ordering between them.
    
    other info that might help us debug this:
    Chain exists of:
      &dev->event_lock --> &new->fa_lock --> &f->f_owner.lock
    
     Possible interrupt unsafe locking scenario:
    
           CPU0                    CPU1
           ----                    ----
      lock(&f->f_owner.lock);
                                   local_irq_disable();
                                   lock(&dev->event_lock);
                                   lock(&new->fa_lock);
      <Interrupt>
        lock(&dev->event_lock);
    
     *** DEADLOCK ***
    
    This happens because there is a lock hierarchy of
    &dev->event_lock --> &new->fa_lock --> &f->f_owner.lock
    from the following call chain:
    
      input_inject_event():
        spin_lock_irqsave(&dev->event_lock,...);
        input_handle_event():
          input_pass_values():
            input_to_handler():
              evdev_events():
                evdev_pass_values():
                  spin_lock(&client->buffer_lock);
                  __pass_event():
                    kill_fasync():
                      kill_fasync_rcu():
                        read_lock(&fa->fa_lock);
                        send_sigio():
                          read_lock_irqsave(&fown->lock,...);
    
    However, since &dev->event_lock is HARDIRQ-safe, interrupts have to be
    disabled while grabbing &f->f_owner.lock, otherwise we invert the lock
    hierarchy.
    
    Hence, we replace calls to read_lock/read_unlock on &f->f_owner.lock,
    with read_lock_irq/read_unlock_irq.

    fcntl: make F_GETOWN(EX) return 0 on dead owner task
    
    [ Upstream commit cc4a3f885e8f2bc3c86a265972e94fef32d68f67 ]
    
    Currently there is no way to differentiate the file with alive owner
    from the file with dead owner but pid of the owner reused. That's why
    CRIU can't actually know if it needs to restore file owner or not,
    because if it restores owner but actual owner was dead, this can
    introduce unexpected signals to the "false"-owner (which reused the
    pid).
    
    Let's change the api, so that F_GETOWN(EX) returns 0 in case actual
    owner is dead already. This comports with the POSIX spec, which
    states that a PID of 0 indicates that no signal will be sent.

    perf: Skip and warn on unknown format 'configN' attrs
    
    [ Upstream commit e552b7be12ed62357df84392efa525ecb01910fb ]
    
    If the kernel exposes a new perf_event_attr field in a format attr, perf
    will return an error stating the specified PMU can't be found. For
    example, a format attr with 'config3:0-63' causes an error as config3 is
    unknown to perf. This causes a compatibility issue between a newer
    kernel with older perf tool.
    
    Before this change with a kernel adding 'config3' I get:
    
      $ perf record -e arm_spe// -- true
      event syntax error: 'arm_spe//'
                           \___ Cannot find PMU `arm_spe'. Missing kernel support?
      Run 'perf list' for a list of valid events
    
       Usage: perf record [<options>] [<command>]
          or: perf record [<options>] -- <command> [<options>]
    
          -e, --event <event>   event selector. use 'perf list' to list
      available events
    
    After this change, I get:
    
      $ perf record -e arm_spe// -- true
      WARNING: 'arm_spe_0' format 'inv_event_filter' requires 'perf_event_attr::config3' which is not supported by this version of perf!
      [ perf record: Woken up 2 times to write data ]
      [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.091 MB perf.data ]
    
    To support unknown configN formats, rework the YACC implementation to
    pass any config[0-9]+ format to perf_pmu__new_format() to handle with a
    warning.

    perf pmu: Validate raw event with sysfs exported format bits
    
    [ Upstream commit e40647762fb5881360874e08e03e972d58d63c42 ]
    
    A raw PMU event (eventsel+umask) in the form of rNNN is supported
    by perf but lacks of checking for the validity of raw encoding.
    
    For example, bit 16 and bit 17 are not valid on KBL but perf doesn't
    report warning when encoding with these bits.
    
    Before:
    
      # ./perf stat -e cpu/r031234/ -a -- sleep 1
    
       Performance counter stats for 'system wide':
    
                       0      cpu/r031234/
    
             1.003798924 seconds time elapsed
    
    It may silently measure the wrong event!
    
    The kernel supported bits have been exported through
    /sys/devices/<pmu>/format/. Perf collects the information to
    'struct perf_pmu_format' and links it to 'pmu->format' list.
    
    The 'struct perf_pmu_format' has a bitmap which records the
    valid bits for this format. For example,
    
      root@kbl-ppc:/sys/devices/cpu/format# cat umask
      config:8-15
    
    The valid bits (bit8-bit15) are recorded in bitmap of format 'umask'.
    
    We collect total valid bits of all formats, save to a local variable
    'masks' and reverse it. Now '~masks' represents total invalid bits.
    
    bits = config & ~masks;
    
    The set bits in 'bits' indicate the invalid bits used in config.
    Finally we use bitmap_scnprintf to report the invalid bits.
    
    Some architectures may not export supported bits through sysfs,
    so if masks is 0, perf_pmu__warn_invalid_config directly returns.
    
    After:
    
    Single event without name:
    
      # ./perf stat -e cpu/r031234/ -a -- sleep 1
      WARNING: event 'N/A' not valid (bits 16-17 of config '31234' not supported by kernel)!
    
       Performance counter stats for 'system wide':
    
                       0      cpu/r031234/
    
             1.001597373 seconds time elapsed
    
    Multiple events with names:
    
      # ./perf stat -e cpu/rf01234,name=aaa/,cpu/r031234,name=bbb/ -a -- sleep 1
      WARNING: event 'aaa' not valid (bits 20,22 of config 'f01234' not supported by kernel)!
      WARNING: event 'bbb' not valid (bits 16-17 of config '31234' not supported by kernel)!
    
       Performance counter stats for 'system wide':
    
                       0      aaa
                       0      bbb
    
             1.001573787 seconds time elapsed
    
    Warnings are reported for invalid bits.

    riscv: always honor the CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE when parsing dtb
    
    [ Upstream commit 10f6913c548b32ecb73801a16b120e761c6957ea ]
    
    When CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE is enabled, cmdline provided by
    CONFIG_CMDLINE are always used. This allows CONFIG_CMDLINE to be
    used regardless of the result of device tree scanning.
    
    This especially fixes the case where a device tree without the
    chosen node is supplied to the kernel. In such cases,
    early_init_dt_scan would return true. But inside
    early_init_dt_scan_chosen, the cmdline won't be updated as there
    is no chosen node in the device tree. As a result, CONFIG_CMDLINE
    is not copied into boot_command_line even if CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE
    is enabled. This commit allows properly update boot_command_line
    in this situation.

    xen/gntdev: Accommodate VMA splitting
    
    [ Upstream commit 5c13a4a0291b30191eff9ead8d010e1ca43a4d0c ]
    
    Prior to this commit, the gntdev driver code did not handle the
    following scenario correctly with paravirtualized (PV) Xen domains:
    
    * User process sets up a gntdev mapping composed of two grant mappings
      (i.e., two pages shared by another Xen domain).
    * User process munmap()s one of the pages.
    * User process munmap()s the remaining page.
    * User process exits.
    
    In the scenario above, the user process would cause the kernel to log
    the following messages in dmesg for the first munmap(), and the second
    munmap() call would result in similar log messages:
    
      BUG: Bad page map in process doublemap.test  pte:... pmd:...
      page:0000000057c97bff refcount:1 mapcount:-1 \

      ...
      file:gntdev fault:0x0 mmap:gntdev_mmap [xen_gntdev] readpage:0x0
      ...
      Call Trace:
       <TASK>

       do_syscall_64+0x38/0x90
       entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x61/0xcb
       ...
    
    For each munmap() call, the Xen hypervisor (if built with CONFIG_DEBUG)
    would print out the following and trigger a general protection fault in
    the affected Xen PV domain:
    
      (XEN) d0v... Attempt to implicitly unmap d0's grant PTE ...
      (XEN) d0v... Attempt to implicitly unmap d0's grant PTE ...
    
    As of this writing, gntdev_grant_map structure's vma field (referred to
    as map->vma below) is mainly used for checking the start and end
    addresses of mappings. However, with split VMAs, these may change, and
    there could be more than one VMA associated with a gntdev mapping.
    Hence, remove the use of map->vma and rely on map->pages_vm_start for
    the original start address and on (map->count << PAGE_SHIFT) for the
    original mapping size. Let the invalidate() and find_special_page()
    hooks use these.
    
    Also, given that there can be multiple VMAs associated with a gntdev
    mapping, move the "mmu_interval_notifier_remove(&map->notifier)" call to
    the end of gntdev_put_map, so that the MMU notifier is only removed
    after the closing of the last remaining VMA.
    
    Finally, use an atomic to prevent inadvertent gntdev mapping re-use,
    instead of using the map->live_grants atomic counter and/or the map->vma
    pointer (the latter of which is now removed). This prevents the
    userspace from mmap()'ing (with MAP_FIXED) a gntdev mapping over the
    same address range as a previously set up gntdev mapping. This scenario
    can be summarized with the following call-trace, which was valid prior
    to this commit:
    
      mmap
        gntdev_mmap
      mmap (repeat mmap with MAP_FIXED over the same address range)
        gntdev_invalidate
          unmap_grant_pages (sets 'being_removed' entries to true)
            gnttab_unmap_refs_async
        unmap_single_vma
        gntdev_mmap (maps the shared pages again)
      munmap
        gntdev_invalidate
          unmap_grant_pages
            (no-op because 'being_removed' entries are true)
        unmap_single_vma (For PV domains, Xen reports that a granted page
          is being unmapped and triggers a general protection fault in the
          affected domain, if Xen was built with CONFIG_DEBUG)
    
    The fix for this last scenario could be worth its own commit, but we
    opted for a single commit, because removing the gntdev_grant_map
    structure's vma field requires guarding the entry to gntdev_mmap(), and
    the live_grants atomic counter is not sufficient on its own to prevent
    the mmap() over a pre-existing mapping.

    tracing: Do not free snapshot if tracer is on cmdline
    
    [ Upstream commit a541a9559bb0a8ecc434de01d3e4826c32e8bb53 ]
    
    The ftrace_boot_snapshot and alloc_snapshot cmdline options allocate the
    snapshot buffer at boot up for use later. The ftrace_boot_snapshot in
    particular requires the snapshot to be allocated because it will take a
    snapshot at the end of boot up allowing to see the traces that happened
    during boot so that it's not lost when user space takes over.
    
    When a tracer is registered (started) there's a path that checks if it
    requires the snapshot buffer or not, and if it does not and it was
    allocated it will do a synchronization and free the snapshot buffer.
    
    This is only required if the previous tracer was using it for "max
    latency" snapshots, as it needs to make sure all max snapshots are
    complete before freeing. But this is only needed if the previous tracer
    was using the snapshot buffer for latency (like irqoff tracer and
    friends). But it does not make sense to free it, if the previous tracer
    was not using it, and the snapshot was allocated by the cmdline
    parameters. This basically takes away the point of allocating it in the
    first place!
    
    Note, the allocated snapshot worked fine for just trace events, but fails
    when a tracer is enabled on the cmdline.
    
    Further investigation, this goes back even further and it does not require
    a tracer on the cmdline to fail. Simply enable snapshots and then enable a
    tracer, and it will remove the snapshot.

    dmaengine: mxs: use platform_driver_register
    
    [ Upstream commit 26696d4657167112a1079f86cba1739765c1360e ]
    
    Driver registration fails on SOC imx8mn as its supplier, the clock
    control module, is probed later than subsys initcall level. This driver
    uses platform_driver_probe which is not compatible with deferred probing
    and won't be probed again later if probe function fails due to clock not
    being available at that time.
    
    This patch replaces the use of platform_driver_probe with
    platform_driver_register which will allow probing the driver later again
    when the clock control module will be available.
    
    The __init annotation has been dropped because it is not compatible with
    deferred probing. The code is not executed once and its memory cannot be
    freed.

    A splat from kmem_cache_destroy() was seen with a kernel prior to
    commit ee2653bbe89d ("iommu/vt-d: Remove domain and devinfo mempool")
    when there was a failure in init_dmars(), because the iommu_domain
    cache still had objects. While the mempool code is now gone, there
    still is a leak of the si_domain memory if init_dmars() fails. So
    clean up si_domain in the init_dmars() error path.

    iommu/vt-d: Allow NVS regions in arch_rmrr_sanity_check()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5566e68d829f5d87670d5984c1c2ccb4c518405f ]
    
    arch_rmrr_sanity_check() warns if the RMRR is not covered by an ACPI
    Reserved region, but it seems like it should accept an NVS region as
    well. The ACPI spec
    https://uefi.org/specs/ACPI/6.5/15_System_Address_Map_Interfaces.html
    uses similar wording for "Reserved" and "NVS" region types; for NVS
    regions it says "This range of addresses is in use or reserved by the
    system and must not be used by the operating system."
    
    There is an old comment on this mailing list that also suggests NVS
    regions should pass the arch_rmrr_sanity_check() test:
    
     The warnings come from arch_rmrr_sanity_check() since it checks whether
     the region is E820_TYPE_RESERVED. However, if the purpose of the check
     is to detect RMRR has regions that may be used by OS as free memory,
     isn't  E820_TYPE_NVS safe, too?
    
    This patch overlaps with another proposed patch that would add the region
    type to the log since sometimes the bug reporter sees this log on the
    console but doesn't know to include the kernel log:
    
    https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220611204859.234975-3-atomlin@redhat.com/
    
    Here's an example of the "Firmware Bug" apparent false positive (wrapped
    for line length):
    
     DMAR: [Firmware Bug]: No firmware reserved region can cover this RMRR

    If the cable is disconnected the PHY seems to toggle between MDI and
    MDI-X modes. With the MDI crossover status interrupt active this causes
    roughly 10 interrupts per second.
    
    As the crossover status isn't checked by the driver, the interrupt can
    be disabled to reduce the interrupt load.

    net: sched: fix race condition in qdisc_graft()
    
    [ Upstream commit ebda44da44f6f309d302522b049f43d6f829f7aa ]
    
    We had one syzbot report [1] in syzbot queue for a while.
    I was waiting for more occurrences and/or a repro but
    Dmitry Vyukov spotted the issue right away.
    
    <quoting Dmitry>
    qdisc_graft() drops reference to qdisc in notify_and_destroy
    while it's still assigned to dev->qdisc
    </quoting>
    
    Indeed, RCU rules are clear when replacing a data structure.
    The visible pointer (dev->qdisc in this case) must be updated
    to the new object _before_ RCU grace period is started
    (qdisc_put(old) in this case).

    net: hns: fix possible memory leak in hnae_ae_register()
    
    [ Upstream commit ff2f5ec5d009844ec28f171123f9e58750cef4bf ]
    
    Inject fault while probing module, if device_register() fails,
    but the refcount of kobject is not decreased to 0, the name
    allocated in dev_set_name() is leaked. Fix this by calling
    put_device(), so that name can be freed in callback function
    kobject_cleanup().

    nvme-hwmon: kmalloc the NVME SMART log buffer
    
    [ Upstream commit c94b7f9bab22ac504f9153767676e659988575ad ]
    
    Recent commit 52fde2c07da6 ("nvme: set dma alignment to dword") has
    caused a regression on our platform.
    
    It turned out that the nvme_get_log() method invocation caused the
    nvme_hwmon_data structure instance corruption.  In particular the
    nvme_hwmon_data.ctrl pointer was overwritten either with zeros or with
    garbage.  After some research we discovered that the problem happened
    even before the actual NVME DMA execution, but during the buffer mapping.
    Since our platform is DMA-noncoherent, the mapping implied the cache-line
    invalidations or write-backs depending on the DMA-direction parameter.
    In case of the NVME SMART log getting the DMA was performed
    from-device-to-memory, thus the cache-invalidation was activated during
    the buffer mapping.  Since the log-buffer isn't cache-line aligned, the
    cache-invalidation caused the neighbour data to be discarded.  The
    neighbouring data turned to be the data surrounding the buffer in the
    framework of the nvme_hwmon_data structure.
    
    In order to fix that we need to make sure that the whole log-buffer is
    defined within the cache-line-aligned memory region so the
    cache-invalidation procedure wouldn't involve the adjacent data. One of
    the option to guarantee that is to kmalloc the DMA-buffer [1]. Seeing the
    rest of the NVME core driver prefer that method it has been chosen to fix
    this problem too.
    
    Note after a deeper researches we found out that the denoted commit wasn't
    a root cause of the problem. It just revealed the invalidity by activating
    the DMA-based NVME SMART log getting performed in the framework of the
    NVME hwmon driver. The problem was here since the initial commit of the
    driver.

    [ Upstream commit 78570f8873c8cd44c12714c7fa7db2601ec5617d ]
    
    The hwmon pointer wont be NULL if the registration fails. Though the
    exit code path will assign it to ctrl->hwmon_device. Later
    nvme_hwmon_exit() will try to free the invalid pointer. Avoid this by
    returning the error code from hwmon_device_register_with_info().

    nvme-hwmon: rework to avoid devm allocation
    
    [ Upstream commit ed7770f6628691c13c9423bce7eee7cff2399c12 ]
    
    The original design to use device-managed resource allocation
    doesn't really work as the NVMe controller has a vastly different
    lifetime than the hwmon sysfs attributes, causing warning about
    duplicate sysfs entries upon reconnection.
    This patch reworks the hwmon allocation to avoid device-managed
    resource allocation, and uses the NVMe controller as parent for
    the sysfs attributes.

    [ Upstream commit aa1d7e1267c12e07d979aa34c613716a89029db2 ]
    
    It's possible that the driver will dereference a qcq that doesn't exist
    when calling ionic_reconfigure_queues(), which causes a page fault BUG.
    
    If a reduction in the number of queues is followed by a different
    reconfig such as changing the ring size, the driver can hit a NULL
    pointer when trying to clean up non-existent queues.
    
    Fix this by checking to make sure both the qcqs array and qcq entry
    exists bofore trying to use and free the entry.

    sfc: Change VF mac via PF as first preference if available.
    
    [ Upstream commit a8aed7b35becfd21f22a77c7014029ea837b018f ]
    
    Changing a VF's mac address through the VF (rather than via the PF)
    fails with EPERM because the latter part of efx_ef10_set_mac_address
    attempts to change the vport mac address list as the VF.
    Even with this fixed it still fails with EBUSY because the vadaptor
    is still assigned on the VF - the vadaptor reassignment must be within
    a section where the VF has torn down its state.
    
    A major reason this has broken is because we have two functions that
    ostensibly do the same thing - have a PF and VF cooperate to change a
    VF mac address. Rather than do this, if we are changing the mac of a VF
    that has a link to the PF in the same VM then simply call
    sriov_set_vf_mac instead, which is a proven working function that does
    that.
    
    If there is no PF available, or that fails non-fatally, then attempt to
    change the VF's mac address as we would a PF, without updating the PF's
    data.
    
    Test case:
    Create a VF:
      echo 1 > /sys/class/net/<if>/device/sriov_numvfs
    Set the mac address of the VF directly:
      ip link set <vf> addr 00:11:22:33:44:55
    Set the MAC address of the VF via the PF:
      ip link set <pf> vf 0 mac 00:11:22:33:44:66
    Without this patch the last command will fail with ENOENT.

    This was caused because of new buffers with different RX ring count should
    substitute older ones, but those buffers were freed in
    i40e_configure_rx_ring and reallocated again with i40e_alloc_rx_bi,
    thus kfree on rx_bi caused leak of already mapped DMA.
    
    Fix this by reallocating ZC with rx_bi_zc struct when BPF program loads. Additionally
    reallocate back to rx_bi when BPF program unloads.
    
    If BPF program is loaded/unloaded and XSK pools are created, reallocate
    RX queues accordingly in XSP_SETUP_XSK_POOL handler.

    The trial period exists until jiffies is after addr_trial_end. But as
    jiffies will eventually overflow, just using time_after will eventually
    give incorrect results. As the node address is set once the trial period

    btrfs: fix processing of delayed tree block refs during backref walking
    
    [ Upstream commit 943553ef9b51db303ab2b955c1025261abfdf6fb ]
    
    During backref walking, when processing a delayed reference with a type of
    BTRFS_TREE_BLOCK_REF_KEY, we have two bugs there:
    
    1) We are accessing the delayed references extent_op, and its key, without
       the protection of the delayed ref head's lock;
    
    2) If there's no extent op for the delayed ref head, we end up with an
       uninitialized key in the stack, variable 'tmp_op_key', and then pass
       it to add_indirect_ref(), which adds the reference to the indirect
       refs rb tree.
    
       This is wrong, because indirect references should have a NULL key
       when we don't have access to the key, and in that case they should be
       added to the indirect_missing_keys rb tree and not to the indirect rb
       tree.
    
       This means that if have BTRFS_TREE_BLOCK_REF_KEY delayed ref resulting
       from freeing an extent buffer, therefore with a count of -1, it will
       not cancel out the corresponding reference we have in the extent tree
       (with a count of 1), since both references end up in different rb
       trees.
    
       When using fiemap, where we often need to check if extents are shared
       through shared subtrees resulting from snapshots, it means we can
       incorrectly report an extent as shared when it's no longer shared.
       However this is temporary because after the transaction is committed
       the extent is no longer reported as shared, as running the delayed
       reference results in deleting the tree block reference from the extent
       tree.
    
       Outside the fiemap context, the result is unpredictable, as the key was
       not initialized but it's used when navigating the rb trees to insert
       and search for references (prelim_ref_compare()), and we expect all
       references in the indirect rb tree to have valid keys.
    
    The following reproducer triggers the second bug:
    
       $ cat test.sh
       #!/bin/bash

       btrfs subvolume snapshot $MNT $MNT/snap
    
       # Fiemap should output 0x2008 in the flags column.
       # 0x2000 means shared extent
       # 0x8 means encoded extent (because it's compressed)
       echo
       echo "fiemap after snapshot, range [120M, 120M + 128K):"

       # BTRFS_TREE_BLOCK_REF_KEY with a count of -1 for every COWed extent
       # buffer in the path.
       #
       # In the extent tree we have inline references of type
       # BTRFS_TREE_BLOCK_REF_KEY, with a count of 1, for the same extent
       # buffers, so they should cancel each other, and the extent buffers in
       # the fs tree should no longer be considered as shared.

       xfs_io -c "fsync" $MNT/snap/foo
    
       # Fiemap should output 0x8 in the flags column. The extent in the range
       # [120M, 120M + 128K) is no longer shared, it's now exclusive to the fs

       echo
       echo "fiemap after overwrite range [120M, 120M + 128K):"
       xfs_io -c "fiemap -v 120M 128K" $MNT/foo
       echo
    
       umount $MNT

    The extent in the range [120M, 120M + 128K) is still reported as shared
    (0x2000 bit set) after overwriting that range and flushing delalloc, which
    is not correct - an entire path was COWed in the snapshot's tree and the
    extent is now only referenced by the original fs tree.
    
    Running it after this patch:

    Now the extent is not reported as shared anymore.
    
    So fix this by passing a NULL key pointer to add_indirect_ref() when
    processing a delayed reference for a tree block if there's no extent op
    for our delayed ref head with a defined key. Also access the extent op
    only after locking the delayed ref head's lock.
    
    The reproducer will be converted later to a test case for fstests.

    btrfs: fix processing of delayed data refs during backref walking
    
    [ Upstream commit 4fc7b57228243d09c0d878873bf24fa64a90fa01 ]
    
    When processing delayed data references during backref walking and we are
    using a share context (we are being called through fiemap), whenever we
    find a delayed data reference for an inode different from the one we are
    interested in, then we immediately exit and consider the data extent as
    shared. This is wrong, because:
    
    1) This might be a DROP reference that will cancel out a reference in the
       extent tree;
    
    2) Even if it's an ADD reference, it may be followed by a DROP reference
       that cancels it out.
    
    In either case we should not exit immediately.
    
    Fix this by never exiting when we find a delayed data reference for
    another inode - instead add the reference and if it does not cancel out
    other delayed reference, we will exit early when we call
    extent_is_shared() after processing all delayed references. If we find
    a drop reference, then signal the code that processes references from
    the extent tree (add_inline_refs() and add_keyed_refs()) to not exit
    immediately if it finds there a reference for another inode, since we
    have delayed drop references that may cancel it out. In this later case
    we exit once we don't have references in the rb trees that cancel out
    each other and have two references for different inodes.
    
    Example reproducer for case 1):
    
       $ cat test-1.sh
       #!/bin/bash
    
       DEV=/dev/sdj
       MNT=/mnt/sdj
    
       mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
       mount $DEV $MNT
    
       xfs_io -f -c "pwrite 0 64K" $MNT/foo
       cp --reflink=always $MNT/foo $MNT/bar
    
       echo
       echo "fiemap after cloning:"
       xfs_io -c "fiemap -v" $MNT/foo
    
       rm -f $MNT/bar
       echo
       echo "fiemap after removing file bar:"
       xfs_io -c "fiemap -v" $MNT/foo
    
       umount $MNT
    
    Running it before this patch, the extent is still listed as shared, it has
    the flag 0x2000 (FIEMAP_EXTENT_SHARED) set:

    After this patch, after deleting bar in both tests, the extent is not
    reported with the 0x2000 flag anymore, it gets only the flag 0x1
    (which is FIEMAP_EXTENT_LAST):

    r8152: add PID for the Lenovo OneLink+ Dock
    
    commit 1bd3a383075c64d638e65d263c9267b08ee7733c upstream.
    
    The Lenovo OneLink+ Dock contains an RTL8153 controller that behaves as
    a broken CDC device by default. Add the custom Lenovo PID to the r8152
    driver to support it properly.
    
    Also, systems compatible with this dock provide a BIOS option to enable
    MAC address passthrough (as per Lenovo document "ThinkPad Docking
    Solutions 2017"). Add the custom PID to the MAC passthrough list too.
    
    Tested on a ThinkPad 13 1st gen with the expected results:
    
    passthrough disabled: Invalid header when reading pass-thru MAC addr
    passthrough enabled:  Using pass-thru MAC addr XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

    arm64: errata: Remove AES hwcap for COMPAT tasks
    
    commit 44b3834b2eed595af07021b1c64e6f9bc396398b upstream.
    
    Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A72 have an erratum where an interrupt that
    occurs between a pair of AES instructions in aarch32 mode may corrupt
    the ELR. The task will subsequently produce the wrong AES result.
    
    The AES instructions are part of the cryptographic extensions, which are
    optional. User-space software will detect the support for these
    instructions from the hwcaps. If the platform doesn't support these
    instructions a software implementation should be used.
    
    Remove the hwcap bits on affected parts to indicate user-space should
    not use the AES instructions.

    blk-wbt: call rq_qos_add() after wb_normal is initialized
    
    commit 8c5035dfbb9475b67c82b3fdb7351236525bf52b upstream.
    
    Our test found a problem that wbt inflight counter is negative, which

                                  rq->wbt_flags |= bio_to_wbt_flags(rwb, bio);
                                  // wb_normal is not 0，wbt_flags will be set

        wbt_rqw_done
         atomic_dec_return(&rqw->inflight);
         // inflight is decreased
    
    commit 8235b5c1e8c1 ("block: call bdev_add later in device_add_disk") can
    avoid this problem, however it's better to fix this problem in wbt:
    
    1) Lower kernel can't backport this patch due to lots of refactor.
    2) Root cause is that wbt call rq_qos_add() before wb_normal is
    initialized.

    KVM: arm64: vgic: Fix exit condition in scan_its_table()
    
    commit c000a2607145d28b06c697f968491372ea56c23a upstream.
    
    With some PCIe topologies, restoring a guest fails while
    parsing the ITS device tables.
    
    Reproducer hints:
    1. Create ARM virt VM with pxb-pcie bus which adds
       extra host bridges, with qemu command like:
    
    ```
      -device pxb-pcie,bus_nr=8,id=pci.x,numa_node=0,bus=pcie.0 \
      -device pcie-root-port,..,bus=pci.x \
      ...
      -device pxb-pcie,bus_nr=37,id=pci.y,numa_node=1,bus=pcie.0 \
      -device pcie-root-port,..,bus=pci.y \
      ...
    
    ```
    2. Ensure the guest uses 2-level device table
    3. Perform VM migration which calls save/restore device tables
    
    In that setup, we get a big "offset" between 2 device_ids,
    which makes unsigned "len" round up a big positive number,
    causing the scan loop to continue with a bad GPA. For example:
    
    1. L1 table has 2 entries;
    2. and we are now scanning at L2 table entry index 2075 (pointed
       to by L1 first entry)
    3. if next device id is 9472, we will get a big offset: 7397;
    4. with unsigned 'len', 'len -= offset * esz', len will underflow to a
       positive number, mistakenly into next iteration with a bad GPA;
       (It should break out of the current L2 table scanning, and jump
       into the next L1 table entry)
    5. that bad GPA fails the guest read.
    
    Fix it by stopping the L2 table scan when the next device id is
    outside of the current table, allowing the scan to continue from
    the next L1 table entry.
    
    Thanks to Eric Auger for the fix suggestion.

    This happens because sata_pmp_init_links() initialize link->pmp up to

    I can't find the maximum Enclosure Management ports specified in AHCI
    spec v1.3.1, but "12.2.1 LED message type" states that "Port Multiplier
    Information" can utilize 4 bits, which implies it can support up to 16
    ports. Hence, use SATA_PMP_MAX_PORTS as EM_MAX_SLOTS to resolve the
    issue.

    hwmon/coretemp: Handle large core ID value
    
    commit 7108b80a542b9d65e44b36d64a700a83658c0b73 upstream.
    
    The coretemp driver supports up to a hard-coded limit of 128 cores.
    
    Today, the driver can not support a core with an ID above that limit.
    Yet, the encoding of core ID's is arbitrary (BIOS APIC-ID) and so they
    may be sparse and they may be large.
    
    Update the driver to map arbitrary core ID numbers into appropriate
    array indexes so that 128 cores can be supported, no matter the encoding
    of core ID's.

    x86/microcode/AMD: Apply the patch early on every logical thread
    
    commit e7ad18d1169c62e6c78c01ff693fd362d9d65278 upstream.
    
    Currently, the patch application logic checks whether the revision
    needs to be applied on each logical CPU (SMT thread). Therefore, on SMT
    designs where the microcode engine is shared between the two threads,
    the application happens only on one of them as that is enough to update
    the shared microcode engine.
    
    However, there are microcode patches which do per-thread modification,
    see Link tag below.
    
    Therefore, drop the revision check and try applying on each thread. This
    is what the BIOS does too so this method is very much tested.
    
    Btw, change only the early paths. On the late loading paths, there's no
    point in doing per-thread modification because if is it some case like
    in the bugzilla below - removing a CPUID flag - the kernel cannot go and
    un-use features it has detected are there early. For that, one should
    use early loading anyway.

    i2c: qcom-cci: Fix ordering of pm_runtime_xx and i2c_add_adapter
    
    commit 61775d54d674ff8ec3658495e0dbc537227dc5c1 upstream.
    
    When we compile-in the CCI along with the imx412 driver and run on the RB5
    we see that i2c_add_adapter() causes the probe of the imx412 driver to
    happen.
    
    This probe tries to perform an i2c xfer() and the xfer() in i2c-qcom-cci.c
    fails on pm_runtime_get() because the i2c-qcom-cci.c::probe() function has
    not completed to pm_runtime_enable(dev).
    
    Fix this sequence by ensuring pm_runtime_xxx() calls happen prior to adding
    the i2c adapter.

    cpufreq: qcom: fix writes in read-only memory region
    
    commit 01039fb8e90c9cb684430414bff70cea9eb168c5 upstream.
    
    This commit fixes a kernel oops because of a write in some read-only memory:
    
            [    9.068287] Unable to handle kernel write to read-only memory at virtual address ffff800009240ad8
            ..snip..
            [    9.138790] Internal error: Oops: 9600004f [#1] PREEMPT SMP

            [    9.276271]  __memcpy+0x5c/0x230

            [    9.284869]  qcom_cpufreq_probe+0xc8/0x39c
            ..snip..
    
    The following line defines a pointer that point to a char buffer stored
    in read-only memory:
    
            char *pvs_name = "speedXX-pvsXX-vXX";
    
    This pointer is meant to hold a template "speedXX-pvsXX-vXX" where the
    XX values get overridden by the qcom_cpufreq_krait_name_version function. Since
    the template is actually stored in read-only memory, when the function
    executes the following call we get an oops:
    
            snprintf(*pvs_name, sizeof("speedXX-pvsXX-vXX"), "speed%d-pvs%d-v%d",
                     speed, pvs, pvs_ver);
    
    To fix this issue, we instead store the template name onto the stack by
    using the following syntax:
    
            char pvs_name_buffer[] = "speedXX-pvsXX-vXX";
    
    Because the `pvs_name` needs to be able to be assigned to NULL, the
    template buffer is stored in the pvs_name_buffer and not under the
    pvs_name variable.

    It was found that within a critical section of spin_lock_irqsave in
    sidtab_context_to_sid(), convert_context() (hooked by
    sidtab_convert_params.func) might cause the process to sleep via
    allocating memory with GFP_KERNEL, which is problematic.
    
    As Ondrej pointed out [1], convert_context()/sidtab_convert_params.func
    has another caller sidtab_convert_tree(), which is okay with GFP_KERNEL.
    Therefore, fix this problem by adding a gfp_t argument for
    convert_context()/sidtab_convert_params.func and pass GFP_KERNEL/_ATOMIC
    properly in individual callers.

    ocfs2: fix BUG when iput after ocfs2_mknod fails
    
    commit 759a7c6126eef5635506453e9b9d55a6a3ac2084 upstream.
    
    Commit b1529a41f777 "ocfs2: should reclaim the inode if
    '__ocfs2_mknod_locked' returns an error" tried to reclaim the claimed
    inode if __ocfs2_mknod_locked() fails later.  But this introduce a race,
    the freed bit may be reused immediately by another thread, which will
    update dinode, e.g.  i_generation.  Then iput this inode will lead to BUG:
    inode->i_generation != le32_to_cpu(fe->i_generation)
    
    We could make this inode as bad, but we did want to do operations like
    wipe in some cases.  Since the claimed inode bit can only affect that an
    dinode is missing and will return back after fsck, it seems not a big
    problem.  So just leave it as is by revert the reclaim logic.

    ocfs2: clear dinode links count in case of error
    
    commit 28f4821b1b53e0649706912e810c6c232fc506f9 upstream.
    
    In ocfs2_mknod(), if error occurs after dinode successfully allocated,
    ocfs2 i_links_count will not be 0.
    
    So even though we clear inode i_nlink before iput in error handling, it
    still won't wipe inode since we'll refresh inode from dinode during inode
    lock.  So just like clear inode i_nlink, we clear ocfs2 i_links_count as
    well.  Also do the same change for ocfs2_symlink().
