    sch_netem: fix issues in netem_change() vs get_dist_table()
    
    commit 11b73313c12403f617b47752db0ab3deef201af7 upstream.
    
    In blamed commit, I missed that get_dist_table() was allocating
    memory using GFP_KERNEL, and acquiring qdisc lock to perform
    the swap of newly allocated table with current one.
    
    In this patch, get_dist_table() is allocating memory and
    copy user data before we acquire the qdisc lock.
    
    Then we perform swap operations while being protected by the lock.
    
    Note that after this patch netem_change() no longer can do partial changes.
    If an error is returned, qdisc conf is left unchanged.

    scsi: storvsc: Fix handling of virtual Fibre Channel timeouts
    
    commit 175544ad48cbf56affeef2a679c6a4d4fb1e2881 upstream.
    
    Hyper-V provides the ability to connect Fibre Channel LUNs to the host
    system and present them in a guest VM as a SCSI device. I/O to the vFC
    device is handled by the storvsc driver. The storvsc driver includes a
    partial integration with the FC transport implemented in the generic
    portion of the Linux SCSI subsystem so that FC attributes can be displayed
    in /sys.  However, the partial integration means that some aspects of vFC
    don't work properly. Unfortunately, a full and correct integration isn't
    practical because of limitations in what Hyper-V provides to the guest.
    
    In particular, in the context of Hyper-V storvsc, the FC transport timeout
    function fc_eh_timed_out() causes a kernel panic because it can't find the
    rport and dereferences a NULL pointer. The original patch that added the
    call from storvsc_eh_timed_out() to fc_eh_timed_out() is faulty in this
    regard.
    
    In many cases a timeout is due to a transient condition, so the situation
    can be improved by just continuing to wait like with other I/O requests
    issued by storvsc, and avoiding the guaranteed panic. For a permanent
    failure, continuing to wait may result in a hung thread instead of a panic,
    which again may be better.
    
    So fix the panic by removing the storvsc call to fc_eh_timed_out().  This
    allows storvsc to keep waiting for a response.  The change has been tested
    by users who experienced a panic in fc_eh_timed_out() due to transient
    timeouts, and it solves their problem.
    
    In the future we may want to deprecate the vFC functionality in storvsc
    since it can't be fully fixed. But it has current users for whom it is
    working well enough, so it should probably stay for a while longer.

    scsi: core: Fix legacy /proc parsing buffer overflow
    
    commit 9426d3cef5000824e5f24f80ed5f42fb935f2488 upstream.
    
    (lightly modified commit message mostly by Linus Torvalds)
    
    The parsing code for /proc/scsi/scsi is disgusting and broken.  We should
    have just used 'sscanf()' or something simple like that, but the logic may
    actually predate our kernel sscanf library routine for all I know.  It
    certainly predates both git and BK histories.
    
    And we can't change it to be something sane like that now, because the
    string matching at the start is done case-insensitively, and the separator
    parsing between numbers isn't done at all, so *any* separator will work,
    including a possible terminating NUL character.
    
    This interface is root-only, and entirely for legacy use, so there is
    absolutely no point in trying to tighten up the parsing.  Because any
    separator has traditionally worked, it's entirely possible that people have
    used random characters rather than the suggested space.
    
    So don't bother to try to pretty it up, and let's just make a minimal patch
    that can be back-ported and we can forget about this whole sorry thing for
    another two decades.
    
    Just make it at least not read past the end of the supplied data.

    btrfs: set cache_block_group_error if we find an error
    
    commit 92fb94b69c6accf1e49fff699640fa0ce03dc910 upstream.
    
    We set cache_block_group_error if btrfs_cache_block_group() returns an
    error, this is because we could end up not finding space to allocate and
    mistakenly return -ENOSPC, and which could then abort the transaction
    with the incorrect errno, and in the case of ENOSPC result in a
    WARN_ON() that will trip up tests like generic/475.
    
    However there's the case where multiple threads can be racing, one
    thread gets the proper error, and the other thread doesn't actually call
    btrfs_cache_block_group(), it instead sees ->cached ==
    BTRFS_CACHE_ERROR.  Again the result is the same, we fail to allocate
    our space and return -ENOSPC.  Instead we need to set
    cache_block_group_error to -EIO in this case to make sure that if we do
    not make our allocation we get the appropriate error returned back to
    the caller.

    btrfs: don't stop integrity writeback too early
    
    commit effa24f689ce0948f68c754991a445a8d697d3a8 upstream.
    
    extent_write_cache_pages stops writing pages as soon as nr_to_write hits
    zero.  That is the right thing for opportunistic writeback, but incorrect
    for data integrity writeback, which needs to ensure that no dirty pages
    are left in the range.  Thus only stop the writeback for WB_SYNC_NONE
    if nr_to_write hits 0.
    
    This is a port of write_cache_pages changes in commit 05fe478dd04e
    ("mm: write_cache_pages integrity fix").
    
    Note that I've only trigger the problem with other changes to the btrfs
    writeback code, but this condition seems worthwhile fixing anyway.

    ibmvnic: Handle DMA unmapping of login buffs in release functions
    
    commit d78a671eb8996af19d6311ecdee9790d2fa479f0 upstream.
    
    Rather than leaving the DMA unmapping of the login buffers to the
    login response handler, move this work into the login release functions.
    Previously, these functions were only used for freeing the allocated
    buffers. This could lead to issues if there are more than one
    outstanding login buffer requests, which is possible if a login request
    times out.
    
    If a login request times out, then there is another call to send login.
    The send login function makes a call to the login buffer release
    function. In the past, this freed the buffers but did not DMA unmap.
    Therefore, the VIOS could still write to the old login (now freed)
    buffer. It is for this reason that it is a good idea to leave the DMA
    unmap call to the login buffers release function.
    
    Since the login buffer release functions now handle DMA unmapping,
    remove the duplicate DMA unmapping in handle_login_rsp().

    dmaengine: mcf-edma: Fix a potential un-allocated memory access
    
    commit 0a46781c89dece85386885a407244ca26e5c1c44 upstream.
    
    When 'mcf_edma' is allocated, some space is allocated for a
    flexible array at the end of the struct. 'chans' item are allocated, that is
    to say 'pdata->dma_channels'.
    
    Then, this number of item is stored in 'mcf_edma->n_chans'.
    
    A few lines later, if 'mcf_edma->n_chans' is 0, then a default value of 64
    is set.
    
    This ends to no space allocated by devm_kzalloc() because chans was 0, but
    64 items are read and/or written in some not allocated memory.
    
    Change the logic to define a default value before allocating the memory.

    commit 5fb9a9fb71a33be61d7d8e8ba4597bfb18d604d0 upstream.
    
    AP_VLAN interfaces are virtual, so doesn't really exist as a type for
    capabilities. When passed in as a type, AP is the one that's really intended.

    drivers: net: prevent tun_build_skb() to exceed the packet size limit
    
    commit 59eeb232940515590de513b997539ef495faca9a upstream.
    
    Using the syzkaller repro with reduced packet size it was discovered
    that XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM is not checked in tun_can_build_skb(),
    although pad may be incremented in tun_build_skb(). This may end up
    with exceeding the PAGE_SIZE limit in tun_build_skb().
    
    Jason Wang <jasowang@redhat.com> proposed to count XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM
    always (e.g. without rcu_access_pointer(tun->xdp_prog)) in
    tun_can_build_skb() since there's a window during which XDP program
    might be attached between tun_can_build_skb() and tun_build_skb().
    
    Fixes: 7df13219d757 ("tun: reserve extra headroom only when XDP is set")

    bonding: Fix incorrect deletion of ETH_P_8021AD protocol vid from slaves
    
    commit 01f4fd27087078c90a0e22860d1dfa2cd0510791 upstream.
    
    BUG_ON(!vlan_info) is triggered in unregister_vlan_dev() with
    following testcase:
    
      # ip netns add ns1
      # ip netns exec ns1 ip link add bond0 type bond mode 0
      # ip netns exec ns1 ip link add bond_slave_1 type veth peer veth2
      # ip netns exec ns1 ip link set bond_slave_1 master bond0
      # ip netns exec ns1 ip link add link bond_slave_1 name vlan10 type vlan id 10 protocol 802.1ad
      # ip netns exec ns1 ip link add link bond0 name bond0_vlan10 type vlan id 10 protocol 802.1ad
      # ip netns exec ns1 ip link set bond_slave_1 nomaster
      # ip netns del ns1
    
    The logical analysis of the problem is as follows:
    
    1. create ETH_P_8021AD protocol vlan10 for bond_slave_1:
    register_vlan_dev()
      vlan_vid_add()
        vlan_info_alloc()
        __vlan_vid_add() // add [ETH_P_8021AD, 10] vid to bond_slave_1
    
    2. create ETH_P_8021AD protocol bond0_vlan10 for bond0:
    register_vlan_dev()
      vlan_vid_add()
        __vlan_vid_add()
          vlan_add_rx_filter_info()
              if (!vlan_hw_filter_capable(dev, proto)) // condition established because bond0 without NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_STAG_FILTER
                  return 0;
    
              if (netif_device_present(dev))
                  return dev->netdev_ops->ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid(dev, proto, vid); // will be never called
                  // The slaves of bond0 will not refer to the [ETH_P_8021AD, 10] vid.
    
    3. detach bond_slave_1 from bond0:
    __bond_release_one()
      vlan_vids_del_by_dev()
        list_for_each_entry(vid_info, &vlan_info->vid_list, list)
            vlan_vid_del(dev, vid_info->proto, vid_info->vid);
            // bond_slave_1 [ETH_P_8021AD, 10] vid will be deleted.
            // bond_slave_1->vlan_info will be assigned NULL.
    
    4. delete vlan10 during delete ns1:
    default_device_exit_batch()
      dev->rtnl_link_ops->dellink() // unregister_vlan_dev() for vlan10
        vlan_info = rtnl_dereference(real_dev->vlan_info); // real_dev of vlan10 is bond_slave_1
            BUG_ON(!vlan_info); // bond_slave_1->vlan_info is NULL now, bug is triggered!!!
    
    Add S-VLAN tag related features support to bond driver. So the bond driver
    will always propagate the VLAN info to its slaves.

    mISDN: Update parameter type of dsp_cmx_send()
    
    commit 1696ec8654016dad3b1baf6c024303e584400453 upstream.
    
    When booting a kernel with CONFIG_MISDN_DSP=y and CONFIG_CFI_CLANG=y,
    there is a failure when dsp_cmx_send() is called indirectly from
    call_timer_fn():
    
      [    0.371412] CFI failure at call_timer_fn+0x2f/0x150 (target: dsp_cmx_send+0x0/0x530; expected type: 0x92ada1e9)
    
    The function pointer prototype that call_timer_fn() expects is
    
      void (*fn)(struct timer_list *)
    
    whereas dsp_cmx_send() has a parameter type of 'void *', which causes
    the control flow integrity checks to fail because the parameter types do
    not match.
    
    Change dsp_cmx_send()'s parameter type to be 'struct timer_list' to
    match the expected prototype. The argument is unused anyways, so this
    has no functional change, aside from avoiding the CFI failure.

    commit d5712cd22b9cf109fded1b7f178f4c1888c8b84b upstream.
    
    The original commit adding that check tried to protect the kenrel against
    a potential invalid NULL pointer access.
    
    However we call nouveau_connector_detect_depth once without a native_mode
    set on purpose for non LVDS connectors and this broke DP support in a few

    x86/mm: Fix VDSO and VVAR placement on 5-level paging machines
    
    commit 1b8b1aa90c9c0e825b181b98b8d9e249dc395470 upstream.
    
    Yingcong has noticed that on the 5-level paging machine, VDSO and VVAR
    VMAs are placed above the 47-bit border:
    
    8000001a9000-8000001ad000 r--p 00000000 00:00 0                          [vvar]
    8000001ad000-8000001af000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0                          [vdso]
    
    This might confuse users who are not aware of 5-level paging and expect
    all userspace addresses to be under the 47-bit border.
    
    So far problem has only been triggered with ASLR disabled, although it
    may also occur with ASLR enabled if the layout is randomized in a just
    right way.
    
    The problem happens due to custom placement for the VMAs in the VDSO
    code: vdso_addr() tries to place them above the stack and checks the
    result against TASK_SIZE_MAX, which is wrong. TASK_SIZE_MAX is set to
    the 56-bit border on 5-level paging machines. Use DEFAULT_MAP_WINDOW
    instead.

    provided a fix for the Zen2 VZEROUPPER data corruption bug affecting
    a range of CPU models, but the AMD Custom APU 0405 found on SteamDeck
    was not listed, although it is clearly affected by the vulnerability.
    
    Add this CPU variant to the Zenbleed erratum list, in order to
    unconditionally enable the fallback fix until a proper microcode update
    is available.

    usb: common: usb-conn-gpio: Prevent bailing out if initial role is none
    
    commit 8e21a620c7e6e00347ade1a6ed4967b359eada5a upstream.
    
    Currently if we bootup a device without cable connected, then
    usb-conn-gpio won't call set_role() because last_role is same
    as current role. This happens since last_role gets initialised
    to zero during the probe.
    
    To avoid this, add a new flag initial_detection into struct
    usb_conn_info, which prevents bailing out during initial
    detection.

    usb: dwc3: Properly handle processing of pending events
    
    commit 3ddaa6a274578e23745b7466346fc2650df8f959 upstream.
    
    If dwc3 is runtime suspended we defer processing the event buffer
    until resume, by setting the pending_events flag. Set this flag before
    triggering resume to avoid race with the runtime resume callback.
    
    While handling the pending events, in addition to checking the event
    buffer we also need to process it. Handle this by explicitly calling
    dwc3_thread_interrupt(). Also balance the runtime pm get() operation
    that triggered this processing.

    usb-storage: alauda: Fix uninit-value in alauda_check_media()
    
    commit a6ff6e7a9dd69364547751db0f626a10a6d628d2 upstream.
    
    Syzbot got KMSAN to complain about access to an uninitialized value in
    the alauda subdriver of usb-storage:
    
    BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in alauda_transport+0x462/0x57f0
    drivers/usb/storage/alauda.c:1137
    CPU: 0 PID: 12279 Comm: usb-storage Not tainted 5.3.0-rc7+ #0
    Hardware name: Google Google Compute Engine/Google Compute Engine, BIOS
    Google 01/01/2011
    Call Trace:

      alauda_check_media+0x344/0x3310 drivers/usb/storage/alauda.c:460
    
    The problem is that alauda_check_media() doesn't verify that its USB
    transfer succeeded before trying to use the received data.  What
    should happen if the transfer fails isn't entirely clear, but a
    reasonably conservative approach is to pretend that no media is
    present.
    
    A similar problem exists in a usb_stor_dbg() call in
    alauda_get_media_status().  In this case, when an error occurs the
    call is redundant, because usb_stor_ctrl_transfer() already will print
    a debugging message.
    
    Finally, unrelated to the uninitialized memory access, is the fact
    that alauda_check_media() performs DMA to a buffer on the stack.
    Fortunately usb-storage provides a general purpose DMA-able buffer for
    uses like this.  We'll use it instead.

    nilfs2: fix use-after-free of nilfs_root in dirtying inodes via iput
    
    commit f8654743a0e6909dc634cbfad6db6816f10f3399 upstream.
    
    During unmount process of nilfs2, nothing holds nilfs_root structure after
    nilfs2 detaches its writer in nilfs_detach_log_writer().  Previously,
    nilfs_evict_inode() could cause use-after-free read for nilfs_root if
    inodes are left in "garbage_list" and released by nilfs_dispose_list at
    the end of nilfs_detach_log_writer(), and this bug was fixed by commit
    9b5a04ac3ad9 ("nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of nilfs_root in
    nilfs_evict_inode()").
    
    However, it turned out that there is another possibility of UAF in the
    call path where mark_inode_dirty_sync() is called from iput():
    
    nilfs_detach_log_writer()
      nilfs_dispose_list()
        iput()
          mark_inode_dirty_sync()
            __mark_inode_dirty()
              nilfs_dirty_inode()
                __nilfs_mark_inode_dirty()
                  nilfs_load_inode_block() --> causes UAF of nilfs_root struct
    
    This can happen after commit 0ae45f63d4ef ("vfs: add support for a
    lazytime mount option"), which changed iput() to call
    mark_inode_dirty_sync() on its final reference if i_state has I_DIRTY_TIME
    flag and i_nlink is non-zero.
    
    This issue appears after commit 28a65b49eb53 ("nilfs2: do not write dirty
    data after degenerating to read-only") when using the syzbot reproducer,
    but the issue has potentially existed before.
    
    Fix this issue by adding a "purging flag" to the nilfs structure, setting
    that flag while disposing the "garbage_list" and checking it in
    __nilfs_mark_inode_dirty().
    
    Unlike commit 9b5a04ac3ad9 ("nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of nilfs_root
    in nilfs_evict_inode()"), this patch does not rely on ns_writer to
    determine whether to skip operations, so as not to break recovery on
    mount.  The nilfs_salvage_orphan_logs routine dirties the buffer of
    salvaged data before attaching the log writer, so changing
    __nilfs_mark_inode_dirty() to skip the operation when ns_writer is NULL
    will cause recovery write to fail.  The purpose of using the cleanup-only
    flag is to allow for narrowing of such conditions.

    init_fpstate.xsave.header.xfeatures is always 0 so get_xsave_addr() will

    commit cac7ea57a06016e4914848b707477fb07ee4ae1c upstream.
    
    Currently the pthread allocation for each array item is based on the size
    of a pthread_t pointer and should be the size of the pthread_t structure,
    so the allocation is under-allocating the correct size.  Fix this by using
    the size of each element in the pthreads array.

    drm/nouveau/gr: enable memory loads on helper invocation on all channels
    
    commit 1cb9e2ef66d53b020842b18762e30d0eb4384de8 upstream.
    
    We have a lurking bug where Fragment Shader Helper Invocations can't load
    from memory. But this is actually required in OpenGL and is causing random
    hangs or failures in random shaders.
    
    It is unknown how widespread this issue is, but shaders hitting this can
    end up with infinite loops.
    
    We enable those only on all Kepler and newer GPUs where we use our own
    Firmware.
    
    Nvidia's firmware provides a way to set a kernelspace controlled list of
    mmio registers in the gr space from push buffers via MME macros.

    dmaengine: pl330: Return DMA_PAUSED when transaction is paused
    
    commit 8cda3ececf07d374774f6a13e5a94bc2dc04c26c upstream.
    
    pl330_pause() does not set anything to indicate paused condition which
    causes pl330_tx_status() to return DMA_IN_PROGRESS. This breaks 8250
    DMA flush after the fix in commit 57e9af7831dc ("serial: 8250_dma: Fix
    DMA Rx rearm race"). The function comment for pl330_pause() claims
    pause is supported but resume is not which is enough for 8250 DMA flush
    to work as long as DMA status reports DMA_PAUSED when appropriate.
    
    Add PAUSED state for descriptor and mark BUSY descriptors with PAUSED
    in pl330_pause(). Return DMA_PAUSED from pl330_tx_status() when the
    descriptor is PAUSED.

    ipv6: adjust ndisc_is_useropt() to also return true for PIO
    
    commit 048c796beb6eb4fa3a5a647ee1c81f5c6f0f6a2a upstream.
    
    The upcoming (and nearly finalized):
      https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-collink-6man-pio-pflag/
    will update the IPv6 RA to include a new flag in the PIO field,
    which will serve as a hint to perform DHCPv6-PD.
    
    As we don't want DHCPv6 related logic inside the kernel, this piece of
    information needs to be exposed to userspace.  The simplest option is to
    simply expose the entire PIO through the already existing mechanism.
    
    Even without this new flag, the already existing PIO R (router address)
    flag (from RFC6275) cannot AFAICT be handled entirely in kernel,
    and provides useful information that should be exposed to userspace
    (the router's global address, for use by Mobile IPv6).
    
    Also cc'ing stable@ for inclusion in LTS, as while technically this is
    not quite a bugfix, and instead more of a feature, it is absolutely
    trivial and the alternative is manually cherrypicking into all Android
    Common Kernel trees - and I know Greg will ask for it to be sent in via
    LTS instead...
