    kbuild: Update assembler calls to use proper flags and language target
    
    commit d5c8d6e0fa61401a729e9eb6a9c7077b2d3aebb0 upstream.
    
    as-instr uses KBUILD_AFLAGS, but as-option uses KBUILD_CFLAGS. This can
    cause as-option to fail unexpectedly when CONFIG_WERROR is set, because
    clang will emit -Werror,-Wunused-command-line-argument for various -m
    and -f flags in KBUILD_CFLAGS for assembler sources.
    
    Callers of as-option and as-instr should be adding flags to
    KBUILD_AFLAGS / aflags-y, not KBUILD_CFLAGS / cflags-y. Use
    KBUILD_AFLAGS in all macros to clear up the initial problem.
    
    Unfortunately, -Wunused-command-line-argument can still be triggered
    with clang by the presence of warning flags or macro definitions because
    '-x assembler' is used, instead of '-x assembler-with-cpp', which will
    consume these flags. Switch to '-x assembler-with-cpp' in places where
    '-x assembler' is used, as the compiler is always used as the driver for
    out of line assembler sources in the kernel.
    
    Finally, add -Werror to these macros so that they behave consistently
    whether or not CONFIG_WERROR is set.
    
    [nathan: Reworded and expanded on problems in commit message
             Use '-x assembler-with-cpp' in a couple more places]

    MIPS: Prefer cc-option for additions to cflags
    
    commit 337ff6bb8960fdc128cabd264aaea3d42ca27a32 upstream.
    
    A future change will switch as-option to use KBUILD_AFLAGS instead of
    KBUILD_CFLAGS to allow clang to drop -Qunused-arguments, which may cause
    issues if the flag being tested requires a flag previously added to
    KBUILD_CFLAGS but not KBUILD_AFLAGS. Use cc-option for cflags additions
    so that the flags are tested properly.

    MIPS: Move '-Wa,-msoft-float' check from as-option to cc-option
    
    This patch is for linux-6.1.y and earlier, it has no direct mainline
    equivalent.
    
    In order to backport commit d5c8d6e0fa61 ("kbuild: Update assembler
    calls to use proper flags and language target") to resolve a separate
    issue regarding PowerPC, the problem noticed and fixed by
    commit 80a20d2f8288 ("MIPS: Always use -Wa,-msoft-float and eliminate
    GAS_HAS_SET_HARDFLOAT") needs to be addressed. Unfortunately, 6.1 and
    earlier do not contain commit e4412739472b ("Documentation: raise
    minimum supported version of binutils to 2.25"), so it cannot be assumed
    that all supported versions of GNU as have support for -msoft-float.
    
    In order to switch from KBUILD_CFLAGS to KBUILD_AFLAGS in as-option
    without consequence, move the '-Wa,-msoft-float' check to cc-option,
    including '$(cflags-y)' directly to avoid the issue mentioned in
    commit 80a20d2f8288 ("MIPS: Always use -Wa,-msoft-float and eliminate
    GAS_HAS_SET_HARDFLOAT").

    x86/boot/compressed: prefer cc-option for CFLAGS additions
    
    commit 994f5f7816ff963f49269cfc97f63cb2e4edb84f upstream.
    
    as-option tests new options using KBUILD_CFLAGS, which causes problems
    when using as-option to update KBUILD_AFLAGS because many compiler
    options are not valid assembler options.
    
    This will be fixed in a follow up patch. Before doing so, move the
    assembler test for -Wa,-mrelax-relocations=no from using as-option to
    cc-option.

    scsi: target: core: Fix error path in target_setup_session()
    
    commit 91271699228bfc66f1bc8abc0327169dc156d854 upstream.
    
    In the error exits in target_setup_session(), if a branch is taken to
    free_sess: transport_free_session() may call to target_free_cmd_counter()
    and then fall through to call target_free_cmd_counter() a second time.
    This can, and does, sometimes cause seg faults since the data field in
    cmd_cnt->refcnt has been freed in the first call.
    
    Fix this problem by simply returning after the call to
    transport_free_session(). The second call is redundant for those cases.

    In my previous commit 0349b8779cc9 ("sched: add new attr TCA_EXT_WARN_MSG

    Let's add a TCA_ROOT_EXT_WARN_MSG for tc action specifically and put this
    param before going to the TCA_ACT_TAB nest.

    This is not a correct fix as TCA_EXT_WARN_MSG is not a hierarchy to

    rcu/kvfree: Avoid freeing new kfree_rcu() memory after old grace period
    
    commit 5da7cb193db32da783a3f3e77d8b639989321d48 upstream.
    
    Memory passed to kvfree_rcu() that is to be freed is tracked by a
    per-CPU kfree_rcu_cpu structure, which in turn contains pointers
    to kvfree_rcu_bulk_data structures that contain pointers to memory
    that has not yet been handed to RCU, along with an kfree_rcu_cpu_work
    structure that tracks the memory that has already been handed to RCU.
    These structures track three categories of memory: (1) Memory for
    kfree(), (2) Memory for kvfree(), and (3) Memory for both that arrived
    during an OOM episode.  The first two categories are tracked in a
    cache-friendly manner involving a dynamically allocated page of pointers
    (the aforementioned kvfree_rcu_bulk_data structures), while the third
    uses a simple (but decidedly cache-unfriendly) linked list through the
    rcu_head structures in each block of memory.
    
    On a given CPU, these three categories are handled as a unit, with that
    CPU's kfree_rcu_cpu_work structure having one pointer for each of the
    three categories.  Clearly, new memory for a given category cannot be
    placed in the corresponding kfree_rcu_cpu_work structure until any old
    memory has had its grace period elapse and thus has been removed.  And
    the kfree_rcu_monitor() function does in fact check for this.
    
    Except that the kfree_rcu_monitor() function checks these pointers one
    at a time.  This means that if the previous kfree_rcu() memory passed
    to RCU had only category 1 and the current one has only category 2, the
    kfree_rcu_monitor() function will send that current category-2 memory
    along immediately.  This can result in memory being freed too soon,
    that is, out from under unsuspecting RCU readers.
    
    To see this, consider the following sequence of events, in which:
    
    o       Task A on CPU 0 calls rcu_read_lock(), then uses "from_cset",
            then is preempted.
    
    o       CPU 1 calls kfree_rcu(cset, rcu_head) in order to free "from_cset"
            after a later grace period.  Except that "from_cset" is freed
            right after the previous grace period ended, so that "from_cset"
            is immediately freed.  Task A resumes and references "from_cset"'s
            member, after which nothing good happens.

    This commit therefore causes kfree_rcu_monitor() to refrain from moving

    grace period has completed for all three categories.

    afs: Fix vlserver probe RTT handling
    
    [ Upstream commit ba00b190670809c1a89326d80de96d714f6004f2 ]
    
    In the same spirit as commit ca57f02295f1 ("afs: Fix fileserver probe
    RTT handling"), don't rule out using a vlserver just because there
    haven't been enough packets yet to calculate a real rtt.  Always set the
    server's probe rtt from the estimate provided by rxrpc_kernel_get_srtt,
    which is capped at 1 second.
    
    This could lead to EDESTADDRREQ errors when accessing a cell for the
    first time, even though the vl servers are known and have responded to a
    probe.

    [ Upstream commit 76a4c8b82938bc5020b67663db41f451684bf327 ]
    
    Previously, timestamps were printed using "%lld.%u" which is incorrect
    for nanosecond values lower than 100,000,000 as they're fractional
    digits, therefore leading zeros are meaningful.
    
    This patch changes the format strings to "%lld.%09u" in order to add
    leading zeros to the nanosecond value.

    dm: don't lock fs when the map is NULL during suspend or resume
    
    [ Upstream commit 2760904d895279f87196f0fa9ec570c79fe6a2e4 ]
    
    As described in commit 38d11da522aa ("dm: don't lock fs when the map is
    NULL in process of resume"), a deadlock may be triggered between
    do_resume() and do_mount().
    
    This commit preserves the fix from commit 38d11da522aa but moves it to
    where it also serves to fix a similar deadlock between do_suspend()
    and do_mount().  It does so, if the active map is NULL, by clearing
    DM_SUSPEND_LOCKFS_FLAG in dm_suspend() which is called by both
    do_suspend() and do_resume().

    sfc: fix XDP queues mode with legacy IRQ
    
    [ Upstream commit e84a1e1e683f3558e30f437d7c99df35afb8b52c ]
    
    In systems without MSI-X capabilities, xdp_txq_queues_mode is calculated
    in efx_allocate_msix_channels, but when enabling MSI-X fails, it was not
    changed to a proper default value. This was leading to the driver
    thinking that it has dedicated XDP queues, when it didn't.
    
    Fix it by setting xdp_txq_queues_mode to the correct value if the driver
    fallbacks to MSI or legacy IRQ mode. The correct value is
    EFX_XDP_TX_QUEUES_BORROWED because there are no XDP dedicated queues.
    
    The issue can be easily visible if the kernel is started with pci=nomsi,
    then a call trace is shown. It is not shown only with sfc's modparam
    interrupt_mode=2. Call trace example:
     WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 663 at drivers/net/ethernet/sfc/efx_channels.c:828 efx_set_xdp_channels+0x124/0x260 [sfc]

    net: macsec: fix double free of percpu stats
    
    [ Upstream commit 0c0cf3db83f8c7c9bb141c2771a34043bcf952ef ]
    
    Inside macsec_add_dev() we free percpu macsec->secy.tx_sc.stats and
    macsec->stats on some of the memory allocation failure paths. However, the
    net_device is already registered to that moment: in macsec_newlink(), just
    before calling macsec_add_dev(). This means that during unregister process
    its priv_destructor - macsec_free_netdev() - will be called and will free
    the stats again.
    
    Remove freeing percpu stats inside macsec_add_dev() because
    macsec_free_netdev() will correctly free the already allocated ones. The
    pointers to unallocated stats stay NULL, and free_percpu() treats that
    correctly.

    [ Upstream commit 6ac7a27a8b07588497ed53dfd885df9c72bc67e0 ]
    
    The DEV_MAC_MAXLEN_CFG register contains a 16-bit value - up to 65535.
    Plus 2 * VLAN_HLEN (4), that is up to 65543.
    
    The picos_per_byte variable is the largest when "speed" is lowest -
    SPEED_10 = 10. In that case it is (1000000L * 8) / 10 = 800000.
    
    Their product - 52434400000 - exceeds 32 bits, which is a problem,
    because apparently, a multiplication between two 32-bit factors is
    evaluated as 32-bit before being assigned to a 64-bit variable.
    In fact it's a problem for any MTU value larger than 5368.
    
    Cast one of the factors of the multiplication to u64 to force the
    multiplication to take place on 64 bits.
    
    Issue found by Coverity.

     the problem, perform the following steps:
    (1) tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: htb default 1
    (2) tc chain add dev eth0
    (3) tc filter del dev eth0 chain 0 parent 1: prio 0
    (4) tc filter add dev eth0 chain 0 parent 1:

    ext4: drop the call to ext4_error() from ext4_get_group_info()
    
    [ Upstream commit f451fd97dd2b78f286379203a47d9d295c467255 ]
    
    A recent patch added a call to ext4_error() which is problematic since
    some callers of the ext4_get_group_info() function may be holding a
    spinlock, whereas ext4_error() must never be called in atomic context.
    
    This triggered a report from Syzbot: "BUG: sleeping function called from
    invalid context in ext4_update_super" (see the link below).
    
    Therefore, drop the call to ext4_error() from ext4_get_group_info(). In
    the meantime use eight characters tabs instead of nine characters ones.

    selftests: forwarding: hw_stats_l3: Set addrgenmode in a separate step
    
    [ Upstream commit bef68e201e538eaa3a91f97aae8161eb2d0a8ed7 ]
    
    Setting the IPv6 address generation mode of a net device during its
    creation never worked, but after commit b0ad3c179059 ("rtnetlink: call
    validate_linkmsg in rtnl_create_link") it explicitly fails [1]. The
    failure is caused by the fact that validate_linkmsg() is called before
    the net device is registered, when it still does not have an 'inet6_dev'.
    
    Likewise, raising the net device before setting the address generation
    mode is meaningless, because by the time the mode is set, the address
    has already been generated.
    
    Therefore, fix the test to first create the net device, then set its
    IPv6 address generation mode and finally bring it up.

    net/sched: qdisc_destroy() old ingress and clsact Qdiscs before grafting
    
    [ Upstream commit 84ad0af0bccd3691cb951c2974c5cb2c10594d4a ]
    
    mini_Qdisc_pair::p_miniq is a double pointer to mini_Qdisc, initialized
    in ingress_init() to point to net_device::miniq_ingress.  ingress Qdiscs
    access this per-net_device pointer in mini_qdisc_pair_swap().  Similar
    for clsact Qdiscs and miniq_egress.
    
    Unfortunately, after introducing RTNL-unlocked RTM_{NEW,DEL,GET}TFILTER
    requests (thanks Hillf Danton for the hint), when replacing ingress or
    clsact Qdiscs, for example, the old Qdisc ("@old") could access the same
    miniq_{in,e}gress pointer(s) concurrently with the new Qdisc ("@new"),
    causing race conditions [1] including a use-after-free bug in
    mini_qdisc_pair_swap() reported by syzbot:
    
     BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in mini_qdisc_pair_swap+0x1c2/0x1f0 net/sched/sch_generic.c:1573

    @old and @new should not affect each other.  In other words, @old should
    never modify miniq_{in,e}gress after @new, and @new should not update
    @old's RCU state.
    
    Fixing without changing sch_api.c turned out to be difficult (please
    refer to Closes: for discussions).  Instead, make sure @new's first call
    always happen after @old's last call (in {ingress,clsact}_destroy()) has
    finished:
    
    In qdisc_graft(), return -EBUSY if @old has any ongoing filter requests,
    and call qdisc_destroy() for @old before grafting @new.
    
    Introduce qdisc_refcount_dec_if_one() as the counterpart of
    qdisc_refcount_inc_nz() used for filter requests.  Introduce a
    non-static version of qdisc_destroy() that does a TCQ_F_BUILTIN check,
    just like qdisc_put() etc.
    
    Depends on patch "net/sched: Refactor qdisc_graft() for ingress and
    clsact Qdiscs".
    
    [1] To illustrate, the syzkaller reproducer adds ingress Qdiscs under
    TC_H_ROOT (no longer possible after commit c7cfbd115001 ("net/sched:
    sch_ingress: Only create under TC_H_INGRESS")) on eth0 that has 8
    transmission queues:
    
      Thread 1 creates ingress Qdisc A (containing mini Qdisc a1 and a2),
      then adds a flower filter X to A.
    
      Thread 2 creates another ingress Qdisc B (containing mini Qdisc b1 and
      b2) to replace A, then adds a flower filter Y to B.

    Here, B calls mini_qdisc_pair_swap(), pointing eth0->miniq_ingress to
    its mini Qdisc, b1.  Then, A calls mini_qdisc_pair_swap() again during
    ingress_destroy(), setting eth0->miniq_ingress to NULL, so ingress
    packets on eth0 will not find filter Y in sch_handle_ingress().
    
    This is just one of the possible consequences of concurrently accessing
    miniq_{in,e}gress pointers.

    sched: add new attr TCA_EXT_WARN_MSG to report tc extact message
    
    [ Upstream commit 0349b8779cc949ad9e6aced32672ee48cf79b497 ]
    
    We will report extack message if there is an error via netlink_ack(). But
    if the rule is not to be exclusively executed by the hardware, extack is not
    passed along and offloading failures don't get logged.
    
    In commit 81c7288b170a ("sched: cls: enable verbose logging") Marcelo
    made cls could log verbose info for offloading failures, which helps
    improving Open vSwitch debuggability when using flower offloading.
    
    It would also be helpful if userspace monitor tools, like "tc monitor",
    could log this kind of message, as it doesn't require vswitchd log level
    adjusment. Let's add a new tc attributes to report the extack message so
    the monitor program could receive the failures. e.g.
    
      # tc monitor
      added chain dev enp3s0f1np1 parent ffff: chain 0
      added filter dev enp3s0f1np1 ingress protocol all pref 49152 flower chain 0 handle 0x1
        ct_state +trk+new
        not_in_hw
              action order 1: gact action drop
               random type none pass val 0
               index 1 ref 1 bind 1
    
      Warning: mlx5_core: matching on ct_state +new isn't supported.
    
    In this patch I only report the extack message on add/del operations.
    It doesn't look like we need to report the extack message on get/dump
    operations.
    
    Note this message not only reporte to multicast groups, it could also
    be reported unicast, which may affect the current usersapce tool's behaivor.

    selftests/tc-testing: Fix SFB db test
    
    [ Upstream commit b39d8c41c7a8336ce85c376b5d4906089524a0ae ]
    
    Setting very small value of db like 10ms introduces rounding errors when
    converting to/from jiffies on some kernel configs. For example, on 250hz
    the actual value will be set to 12ms which causes the test to fail:
    
     # $ sudo ./tdc.py  -d eth2 -e 3410
     #  -- ns/SubPlugin.__init__
     # Test 3410: Create SFB with db setting

     #
     # 1..1
     # not ok 1 3410 - Create SFB with db setting
     #         Could not match regex pattern. Verify command output:
     # qdisc sfb 1: root refcnt 2 rehash 600s db 12ms limit 1000p max 25p target 20p increment 0.000503548 decrement 4.57771e-05 penalty_rate 10pps penalty_burst 20p
    
    Set the value to 100ms instead which currently seem to work on 100hz,
    250hz, 300hz and 1000hz kernel configs.

    drm/nouveau: add nv_encoder pointer check for NULL
    
    [ Upstream commit 55b94bb8c42464bad3d2217f6874aa1a85664eac ]
    
    Pointer nv_encoder could be dereferenced at nouveau_connector.c
    in case it's equal to NULL by jumping to goto label.
    This patch adds a NULL-check to avoid it.

    drm/nouveau: don't detect DSM for non-NVIDIA device
    
    [ Upstream commit 11d24327c2d7ad7f24fcc44fb00e1fa91ebf6525 ]
    
    The call site of nouveau_dsm_pci_probe() uses single set of output
    variables for all invocations. So, we must not write anything to them
    unless it's an NVIDIA device. Otherwise, if we are called with another
    device after the NVIDIA device, we'll clober the result of the NVIDIA
    device.
    
    For example, if the other device doesn't have _PR3 resources, the
    detection later would miss the presence of power resource support, and
    the rest of the code will keep using Optimus DSM, breaking power
    management for that machine.
    
    Also, because we're detecting NVIDIA's DSM, it doesn't make sense to run
    this detection on a non-NVIDIA device anyway. Thus, check at the
    beginning of the detection code if this is an NVIDIA card, and just
    return if it isn't.
    
    This, together with commit d22915d22ded ("drm/nouveau/devinit/tu102-:
    wait for GFW_BOOT_PROGRESS == COMPLETED") developed independently and
    landed earlier, fixes runtime power management of the NVIDIA card in
    Lenovo Legion 5-15ARH05. Without this patch, the GPU resumption code
    will "timeout", sometimes hanging userspace.
    
    As a bonus, we'll also stop preventing _PR3 usage from the bridge for
    unrelated devices, which is always nice, I guess.

    igc: Fix possible system crash when loading module
    
    [ Upstream commit c080fe262f9e73a00934b70c16b1479cf40cd2bd ]
    
    Guarantee that when probe() is run again, PTM and PCI busmaster will be
    in the same state as it was if the driver was never loaded.
    
    Avoid an i225/i226 hardware issue that PTM requests can be made even
    though PCI bus mastering is not enabled. These unexpected PTM requests
    can crash some systems.
    
    So, "force" disable PTM and busmastering before removing the driver,
    so they can be re-enabled in the right order during probe(). This is
    more like a workaround and should be applicable for i225 and i226, in
    any platform.

    TX completion. Properly clear the TX buffer/descriptor ring and
    disable the TX Queue ring in igc_free_tx_resources() to avoid that.

    ipvlan: fix bound dev checking for IPv6 l3s mode
    
    [ Upstream commit ce57adc222aba32431c42632b396e9213d0eb0b8 ]
    
    The commit 59a0b022aa24 ("ipvlan: Make skb->skb_iif track skb->dev for l3s
    mode") fixed ipvlan bonded dev checking by updating skb skb_iif. This fix
    works for IPv4, as in raw_v4_input() the dif is from inet_iif(skb), which
    is skb->skb_iif when there is no route.
    
    But for IPv6, the fix is not enough, because in ipv6_raw_deliver() ->
    raw_v6_match(), the dif is inet6_iif(skb), which is returns IP6CB(skb)->iif
    instead of skb->skb_iif if it's not a l3_slave. To fix the IPv6 part
    issue. Let's set IP6CB(skb)->iif to correct ifindex.
    
    BTW, ipvlan handles NS/NA specifically. Since it works fine, I will not
    reset IP6CB(skb)->iif when addr->atype is IPVL_ICMPV6.

    IB/isert: Fix dead lock in ib_isert
    
    [ Upstream commit 691b0480933f0ce88a81ed1d1a0aff340ff6293a ]
    
    - When a iSER session is released, ib_isert module is taking a mutex
      lock and releasing all pending connections. As part of this, ib_isert
      is destroying rdma cm_id. To destroy cm_id, rdma_cm module is sending
      CM events to CMA handler of ib_isert. This handler is taking same
      mutex lock. Hence it leads to deadlock between ib_isert & rdma_cm
      modules.
    
    - For fix, created local list of pending connections and release the
      connection outside of mutex lock.

    RDMA/mlx5: Fix affinity assignment
    
    [ Upstream commit 617f5db1a626f18d5cbb7c7faf7bf8f9ea12be78 ]
    
    The cited commit aimed to ensure that Virtual Functions (VFs) assign a
    queue affinity to a Queue Pair (QP) to distribute traffic when
    the LAG master creates a hardware LAG. If the affinity was set while
    the hardware was not in LAG, the firmware would ignore the affinity value.
    
    However, this commit unintentionally assigned an affinity to QPs on the LAG
    master's VPORT even if the RDMA device was not marked as LAG-enabled.
    In most cases, this was not an issue because when the hardware entered
    hardware LAG configuration, the RDMA device of the LAG master would be
    destroyed and a new one would be created, marked as LAG-enabled.
    
    The problem arises when a user configures Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP).
    In ECMP mode, traffic can be directed to different physical ports based on
    the queue affinity, which is intended for use by VPORTS other than the
    E-Switch manager. ECMP mode is supported only if both E-Switch managers are
    in switchdev mode and the appropriate route is configured via IP. In this
    configuration, the RDMA device is not destroyed, and we retain the RDMA
    device that is not marked as LAG-enabled.
    
    To ensure correct behavior, Send Queues (SQs) opened by the E-Switch
    manager through verbs should be assigned strict affinity. This means they
    will only be able to communicate through the native physical port
    associated with the E-Switch manager. This will prevent the firmware from
    assigning affinity and will not allow the SQs to be remapped in case of
    failover.

    IB/uverbs: Fix to consider event queue closing also upon non-blocking mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 62fab312fa1683e812e605db20d4f22de3e3fb2f ]
    
    Fix ib_uverbs_event_read() to consider event queue closing also upon
    non-blocking mode.
    
    Once the queue is closed (e.g. hot-plug flow) all the existing events
    are cleaned-up as part of ib_uverbs_free_event_queue().
    
    An application that uses the non-blocking FD mode should get -EIO in
    that case to let it knows that the device was removed already.
    
    Otherwise, it can loose the indication that the device was removed and
    won't recover.
    
    As part of that, refactor the code to have a single flow with regards to
    'is_closed' for both blocking and non-blocking modes.

    RDMA/mlx5: Create an indirect flow table for steering anchor
    
    [ Upstream commit e1f4a52ac171dd863fe89055e749ef5e0a0bc5ce ]
    
    A misbehaved user can create a steering anchor that points to a kernel
    flow table and then destroy the anchor without freeing the associated
    STC. This creates a problem as the kernel can't destroy the flow
    table since there is still a reference to it. As a result, this can
    exhaust all available flow table resources, preventing other users from
    using the RDMA device.
    
    To prevent this problem, a solution is implemented where a special flow
    table with two steering rules is created when a user creates a steering
    anchor for the first time. The rules include one that drops all traffic
    and another that points to the kernel flow table. If the steering anchor
    is destroyed, only the rule pointing to the kernel's flow table is removed.
    Any traffic reaching the special flow table after that is dropped.
    
    Since the special flow table is not destroyed when the steering anchor is
    destroyed, any issues are prevented from occurring. The remaining resources
    are only destroyed when the RDMA device is destroyed, which happens after
    all DEVX objects are freed, including the STCs, thus mitigating the issue.

    Delay drop data is initiated for PFs that have the capability of
    rq_delay_drop and are in roce profile.
    
    However, PFs with RAW ethernet profile do not initiate delay drop data
    on function load, causing kernel panic if delay drop struct members are
    accessed later on in case a dropless RQ is created.
    
    Thus, stage the delay drop initialization as part of RAW ethernet
    PF loading process.

    Enable more than 32 IRQs by removing the u32 bit mask in
    iavf_irq_enable_queues(). There is no need for the mask as there are no
    callers that select individual IRQs through the bitmask. Also, if the PF
    allocates more than 32 IRQs, this mask will prevent us from using all of
    them.

    allowed for the IRQ index is 63 as per the iAVF standard 1.0 [1].

    net/sched: cls_u32: Fix reference counter leak leading to overflow
    
    [ Upstream commit 04c55383fa5689357bcdd2c8036725a55ed632bc ]
    
    In the event of a failure in tcf_change_indev(), u32_set_parms() will
    immediately return without decrementing the recently incremented
    reference counter.  If this happens enough times, the counter will
    rollover and the reference freed, leading to a double free which can be
    used to do 'bad things'.
    
    In order to prevent this, move the point of possible failure above the
    point where the reference counter is incremented.  Also save any
    meaningful return values to be applied to the return data at the
    appropriate point in time.
    
    This issue was caught with KASAN.

    [ Upstream commit 6c02568fd1ae53099b4ab86365c5be1ff15f586b ]
    
    Instead of relying on skb->transport_header being set correctly, opt
    instead to parse the L3 header length out of the L3 headers for both
    IPv4/IPv6 when the Extended Layer Op for tcp/udp is used. This fixes a
    bug if GRO is disabled, when GRO is disabled skb->transport_header is
    set by __netif_receive_skb_core() to point to the L3 header, it's later
    fixed by the upper protocol layers, but act_pedit will receive the SKB
    before the fixups are completed. The existing behavior causes the
    following to edit the L3 header if GRO is disabled instead of the UDP
    header:
    
        tc filter add dev eth0 ingress protocol ip flower ip_proto udp \
     dst_ip 192.168.1.3 action pedit ex munge udp set dport 18053
    
    Also re-introduce a rate-limited warning if we were unable to extract
    the header offset when using the 'ex' interface.

    igb: Fix extts capture value format for 82580/i354/i350
    
    [ Upstream commit 6292d7436cf2f0a2ea8800a1d2cbb155d237818a ]
    
    82580/i354/i350 features circle-counter-like timestamp registers
    that are different with newer i210. The EXTTS capture value in
    AUXTSMPx should be converted from raw circle counter value to
    timestamp value in resolution of 1 nanosec by the driver.
    
    This issue can be reproduced on i350 nics, connecting an 1PPS
    signal to a SDP pin, and run 'ts2phc' command to read external
    1PPS timestamp value. On i210 this works fine, but on i350 the
    extts is not correctly converted.
    
    The i350/i354/82580's SYSTIM and other timestamp registers are
    40bit counters, presenting time range of 2^40 ns, that means these
    registers overflows every about 1099s. This causes all these regs
    can't be used directly in contrast to the newer i210/i211s.
    
    The igb driver needs to convert these raw register values to
    valid time stamp format by using kernel timecounter apis for i350s
    families. Here the igb_extts() just forgot to do the convert.

    ping6: Fix send to link-local addresses with VRF.
    
    [ Upstream commit 91ffd1bae1dafbb9e34b46813f5b058581d9144d ]
    
    Ping sockets can't send packets when they're bound to a VRF master
    device and the output interface is set to a slave device.
    
    For example, when net.ipv4.ping_group_range is properly set, so that
    ping6 can use ping sockets, the following kind of commands fails:
      $ ip vrf exec red ping6 fe80::854:e7ff:fe88:4bf1%eth1
    
    What happens is that sk->sk_bound_dev_if is set to the VRF master
    device, but 'oif' is set to the real output device. Since both are set
    but different, ping_v6_sendmsg() sees their value as inconsistent and
    fails.
    
    Fix this by allowing 'oif' to be a slave device of ->sk_bound_dev_if.
    
    This fixes the following kselftest failure:

    net: enetc: correct the indexes of highest and 2nd highest TCs
    
    [ Upstream commit 21225873be1472b7c59ed3650396af0e40578112 ]
    
    For ENETC hardware, the TCs are numbered from 0 to N-1, where N
    is the number of TCs. Numerically higher TC has higher priority.
    It's obvious that the highest priority TC index should be N-1 and
    the 2nd highest priority TC index should be N-2.
    
    However, the previous logic uses netdev_get_prio_tc_map() to get
    the indexes of highest priority and 2nd highest priority TCs, it
    does not make sense and is incorrect to give a "tc" argument to
    netdev_get_prio_tc_map(). So the driver may get the wrong indexes
    of the two highest priotiry TCs which would lead to failed to set
    the CBS for the two highest priotiry TCs.
    
    e.g.
    $ tc qdisc add dev eno0 parent root handle 100: mqprio num_tc 6 \
            map 0 0 1 1 2 3 4 5 queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 2@4 2@6 hw 1
    $ tc qdisc replace dev eno0 parent 100:6 cbs idleslope 100000 \
            sendslope -900000 hicredit 12 locredit -113 offload 1
    $ Error: Specified device failed to setup cbs hardware offload.
      ^^^^^
    
    In this example, the previous logic deems the indexes of the two
    highest priotiry TCs should be 3 and 2. Actually, the indexes are
    5 and 4, because the number of TCs is 6. So it would be failed to
    configure the CBS for the two highest priority TCs.

    netfilter: nf_tables: incorrect error path handling with NFT_MSG_NEWRULE
    
    [ Upstream commit 1240eb93f0616b21c675416516ff3d74798fdc97 ]
    
    In case of error when adding a new rule that refers to an anonymous set,
    deactivate expressions via NFT_TRANS_PREPARE state, not NFT_TRANS_RELEASE.
    Thus, the lookup expression marks anonymous sets as inactive in the next
    generation to ensure it is not reachable in this transaction anymore and
    decrement the set refcount as introduced by c1592a89942e ("netfilter:
    nf_tables: deactivate anonymous set from preparation phase"). The abort
    step takes care of undoing the anonymous set.
    
    This is also consistent with rule deletion, where NFT_TRANS_PREPARE is
    used. Note that this error path is exercised in the preparation step of
    the commit protocol. This patch replaces nf_tables_rule_release() by the
    deactivate and destroy calls, this time with NFT_TRANS_PREPARE.
    
    Due to this incorrect error handling, it is possible to access a
    dangling pointer to the anonymous set that remains in the transaction
    list.

    netfilter: nf_tables: integrate pipapo into commit protocol
    
    [ Upstream commit 212ed75dc5fb9d1423b3942c8f872a868cda3466 ]
    
    The pipapo set backend follows copy-on-update approach, maintaining one
    clone of the existing datastructure that is being updated. The clone
    and current datastructures are swapped via rcu from the commit step.
    
    The existing integration with the commit protocol is flawed because
    there is no operation to clean up the clone if the transaction is
    aborted. Moreover, the datastructure swap happens on set element
    activation.
    
    This patch adds two new operations for sets: commit and abort, these new
    operations are invoked from the commit and abort steps, after the
    transactions have been digested, and it updates the pipapo set backend
    to use it.
    
    This patch adds a new ->pending_update field to sets to maintain a list
    of sets that require this new commit and abort operations.

    spi: fsl-dspi: avoid SCK glitches with continuous transfers
    
    [ Upstream commit c5c31fb71f16ba75bad4ade208abbae225305b65 ]
    
    The DSPI controller has configurable timing for
    
    (a) tCSC: the interval between the assertion of the chip select and the
        first clock edge
    
    (b) tASC: the interval between the last clock edge and the deassertion
        of the chip select
    
    What is a bit surprising, but is documented in the figure "Example of
    continuous transfer (CPHA=1, CONT=1)" in the datasheet, is that when the
    chip select stays asserted between multiple TX FIFO writes, the tCSC and
    tASC times still apply. With CONT=1, chip select remains asserted, but
    SCK takes a break and goes to the idle state for tASC + tCSC ns.
    
    In other words, the default values (of 0 and 0 ns) result in SCK
    glitches where the SCK transition to the idle state, as well as the SCK
    transition from the idle state, will have no delay in between, and it
    may appear that a SCK cycle has simply gone missing. The resulting
    timing violation might cause data corruption in many peripherals, as
    their chip select is asserted.
    
    The driver has device tree bindings for tCSC ("fsl,spi-cs-sck-delay")
    and tASC ("fsl,spi-sck-cs-delay"), but these are only specified to apply
    when the chip select toggles in the first place, and this timing
    characteristic depends on each peripheral. Many peripherals do not have
    explicit timing requirements, so many device trees do not have these
    properties present at all.
    
    Nonetheless, the lack of SCK glitches is a common sense requirement, and
    since the SCK stays in the idle state during transfers for tCSC+tASC ns,
    and that in itself should look like half a cycle, then let's ensure that
    tCSC and tASC are at least a quarter of a SCK period, such that their
    sum is at least half of one.

    RDMA/rxe: Fix ref count error in check_rkey()
    
    [ Upstream commit b00683422fd79dd07c9b75efdce1660e5e19150e ]
    
    There is a reference count error in error path code and a potential race
    in check_rkey() in rxe_resp.c. When looking up the rkey for a memory
    window the reference to the mw from rxe_lookup_mw() is dropped before a
    reference is taken on the mr referenced by the mw. If the mr is destroyed
    immediately after the call to rxe_put(mw) the mr pointer is unprotected
    and may end up pointing at freed memory. The rxe_get(mr) call should take
    place before the rxe_put(mw) call.
    
    All errors in check_rkey() call rxe_put(mw) if mw is not NULL but it was
    already called after the above. The mw pointer should be set to NULL after
    the rxe_put(mw) call to prevent this from happening.

    RDMA/rxe: Fix packet length checks
    
    [ Upstream commit 9a3763e87379c97a78b7c6c6f40720b1e877174f ]
    
    In rxe_net.c a received packet, from udp or loopback, is passed to
    rxe_rcv() in rxe_recv.c as a udp packet. I.e. skb->data is pointing at the
    udp header. But rxe_rcv() makes length checks to verify the packet is long
    enough to hold the roce headers as if it were a roce
    packet. I.e. skb->data pointing at the bth header. A runt packet would
    appear to have 8 more bytes than it actually does which may lead to
    incorrect behavior.
    
    This patch calls skb_pull() to adjust the skb to point at the bth header
    before calling rxe_rcv() which fixes this error.

    RDMA/rtrs: Fix rxe_dealloc_pd warning
    
    [ Upstream commit 9c29c8c7df0688f358d2df5ddd16c97c2f7292b4 ]
    
    In current design:
    1. PD and clt_path->s.dev are shared among connections.
    2. every con[n]'s cleanup phase will call destroy_con_cq_qp()
    3. clt_path->s.dev will be always decreased in destroy_con_cq_qp(), and
       when clt_path->s.dev become zero, it will destroy PD.
    4. when con[1] failed to create, con[1] will not take clt_path->s.dev,
       but it try to decreased clt_path->s.dev
    
    So, in case create_cm(con[0]) succeeds but create_cm(con[1]) fails,
    destroy_con_cq_qp(con[1]) will be called first which will destroy the PD
    while this PD is still taken by con[0].
    
    Here, we refactor the error path of create_cm() and init_conns(), so that
    we do the cleanup in the order they are created.
    
    The warning occurs when destroying RXE PD whose reference count is not
    zero.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: Reset num TRBs before giving back the request
    
    commit 00f8205ffcf112dcef14f8151d78075d38d22c08 upstream.
    
    Consider a scenario where cable disconnect happens when there is an active
    usb reqest queued to the UDC. As part of the disconnect we would issue an
    end transfer with no interrupt-on-completion before giving back this
    request. Since we are giving back the request without skipping TRBs the
    num_trbs field of dwc3_request still holds the stale value previously used.
    Function drivers re-use same request for a given bind-unbind session and
    hence their dwc3_request context gets preserved across cable
    disconnect/connect. When such a request gets re-queued after cable connect,
    we would increase the num_trbs field on top of the previous stale value
    thus incorrectly representing the number of TRBs used. Fix this by
    resetting num_trbs field before giving back the request.

    USB: dwc3: fix use-after-free on core driver unbind
    
    commit e3dbb657571509044be15184a13134fa7c1fdca1 upstream.
    
    Some dwc3 glue drivers are currently accessing the driver data of the
    child core device directly, which is clearly a bad idea as the child may
    not have probed yet or may have been unbound from its driver.
    
    As a workaround until the glue drivers have been fixed, clear the driver
    data pointer before allowing the glue parent device to runtime suspend
    to prevent its driver from accessing data that has been freed during
    unbind.

    USB: dwc3: qcom: fix NULL-deref on suspend
    
    commit d2d69354226de0b333d4405981f3d9c41ba8430a upstream.
    
    The Qualcomm dwc3 glue driver is currently accessing the driver data of
    the child core device during suspend and on wakeup interrupts. This is
    clearly a bad idea as the child may not have probed yet or could have
    been unbound from its driver.
    
    The first such layering violation was part of the initial version of the
    driver, but this was later made worse when the hack that accesses the
    driver data of the grand child xhci device to configure the wakeup
    interrupts was added.
    
    Fixing this properly is not that easily done, so add a sanity check to
    make sure that the child driver data is non-NULL before dereferencing it
    for now.
    
    Note that this relies on subtleties like the fact that driver core is
    making sure that the parent is not suspended while the child is probing.

    usb: gadget: udc: core: Prevent soft_connect_store() race
    
    commit 286d9975a838d0a54da049765fa1d1fb96b89682 upstream.
    
    usb_udc_connect_control(), soft_connect_store() and
    usb_gadget_deactivate() can potentially race against each other to invoke
    usb_gadget_connect()/usb_gadget_disconnect(). To prevent this, guard
    udc->started, gadget->allow_connect, gadget->deactivate and
    gadget->connect with connect_lock so that ->pullup() is only invoked when
    the gadget is bound, started and not deactivated. The routines
    usb_gadget_connect_locked(), usb_gadget_disconnect_locked(),
    usb_udc_connect_control_locked(), usb_gadget_udc_start_locked(),
    usb_gadget_udc_stop_locked() are called with this lock held.
    
    An earlier version of this commit was reverted due to the crash reported in
    https://lore.kernel.org/all/ZF4BvgsOyoKxdPFF@francesco-nb.int.toradex.com/.

    usb: gadget: udc: core: Offload usb_udc_vbus_handler processing
    
    commit 50966da807c81c5eb3bdfd392990fe0bba94d1ee upstream.
    
    usb_udc_vbus_handler() can be invoked from interrupt context by irq
    handlers of the gadget drivers, however, usb_udc_connect_control() has
    to run in non-atomic context due to the following:
    a. Some of the gadget driver implementations expect the ->pullup
       callback to be invoked in non-atomic context.
    b. usb_gadget_disconnect() acquires udc_lock which is a mutex.
    
    Hence offload invocation of usb_udc_connect_control()
    to workqueue.
    
    UDC should not be pulled up unless gadget driver is bound. The new flag
    "allow_connect" is now set by gadget_bind_driver() and cleared by
    gadget_unbind_driver(). This prevents work item to pull up the gadget
    even if queued when the gadget driver is already unbound.

    thunderbolt: Do not touch CL state configuration during discovery
    
    commit 3fe95742af29b8b4eccab2ba94bc521805c6e10c upstream.
    
    If the boot firmware has already established tunnels, especially ones
    that have special requirements from the link such as DisplayPort, we
    should not blindly enable CL states (nor change the TMU configuration).
    Otherwise the existing tunnels may not work as expected.
    
    For this reason, skip the CL state enabling when we go over the existing
    topology. This will also keep the TMU settings untouched because we do
    not change the TMU configuration when CL states are not enabled.

    drm/amd: Make sure image is written to trigger VBIOS image update flow
    
    commit 3eb1a3a04056ba3df3205e169b8acc9da0c65a94 upstream.
    
    The VBIOS image update flow requires userspace to:
    1) Write the image to `psp_vbflash`
    2) Read `psp_vbflash`
    3) Poll `psp_vbflash_status` to check for completion
    
    If userspace reads `psp_vbflash` before writing an image, it's
    possible that it causes problems that can put the dGPU into an invalid
    state.
    
    Explicitly check that an image has been written before letting a read
    succeed.

    nouveau: fix client work fence deletion race
    
    commit c8a5d5ea3ba6a18958f8d76430e4cd68eea33943 upstream.
    
    This seems to have existed for ever but is now more apparant after
    commit 9bff18d13473 ("drm/ttm: use per BO cleanup workers")
    
    My analysis: two threads are running, one in the irq signalling the
    fence, in dma_fence_signal_timestamp_locked, it has done the
    DMA_FENCE_FLAG_SIGNALLED_BIT setting, but hasn't yet reached the
    callbacks.
    
    The second thread in nouveau_cli_work_ready, where it sees the fence is
    signalled, so then puts the fence, cleanups the object and frees the
    work item, which contains the callback.
    
    Thread one goes again and tries to call the callback and causes the
    use-after-free.
    
    Proposed fix: lock the fence signalled check in nouveau_cli_work_ready,
    so either the callbacks are done or the memory is freed.

    dm thin: fix issue_discard to pass GFP_NOIO to __blkdev_issue_discard
    
    commit 722d90822321497e2837cfc9000202e256e6b32f upstream.
    
    issue_discard() passes GFP_NOWAIT to __blkdev_issue_discard() despite
    its code assuming bio_alloc() always succeeds.
    
    Commit 3dba53a958a75 ("dm thin: use __blkdev_issue_discard for async
    discard support") clearly shows where things went bad:
    
    Before commit 3dba53a958a75, dm-thin.c's open-coded
    __blkdev_issue_discard_async() properly handled using GFP_NOWAIT.
    Unfortunately __blkdev_issue_discard() doesn't and it was missed
    during review.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Add quirk flag for HEM devices to enable native DSD playback
    
    commit 122e2cb7e1a30438cc0e8bf70d4279db245d7d5b upstream.
    
    This commit adds new DEVICE_FLG with QUIRK_FLAG_DSD_RAW and Vendor Id for
    HEM devices which supports native DSD. Prior to this change Linux kernel
    was not enabling native DSD playback for HEM devices, and as a result,
    DSD audio was being converted to PCM "on the fly". HEM devices,
    when connected to the system, would only play audio in PCM format,
    even if the source material was in DSD format. With the addition of new
    VENDOR_FLG in the quircks.c file, the devices are now correctly
    recognized, and raw DSD data is transmitted to the device,
    allowing for native DSD playback.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix broken resume due to UAC3 power state
    
    commit 8ba61c9f6c9bdfbf9d197b0282641d24ae909778 upstream.
    
    As reported in the bugzilla below, the PM resume of a UAC3 device may
    fail due to the incomplete power state change, stuck at D1.  The
    reason is that the driver expects the full D0 power state change only
    at hw_params, while the normal PCM resume procedure doesn't call
    hw_params.
    
    For fixing the bug, we add the same power state update to D0 at the
    prepare callback, which is certainly called by the resume procedure.
    
    Note that, with this change, the power state change in the hw_params
    becomes almost redundant, since snd_usb_hw_params() doesn't touch the
    parameters (at least it tires so).  But dropping it is still a bit
    risky (e.g. we have the media-driver binding), so I leave the D0 power
    state change in snd_usb_hw_params() as is for now.

    btrfs: can_nocow_file_extent should pass down args->strict from callers
    
    commit deccae40e4b30f98837e44225194d80c8baf2233 upstream.
    
    Commit 619104ba453ad0 ("btrfs: move common NOCOW checks against a file
    extent into a helper") changed our call to btrfs_cross_ref_exist() to
    always pass false for the 'strict' parameter.  We're passing this down
    through the stack so that we can do a full check for cross references
    during swapfile activation.
    
    With strict always false, this test fails:
    
      btrfs subvol create swappy
      chattr +C swappy
      fallocate -l1G swappy/swapfile
      chmod 600 swappy/swapfile
      mkswap swappy/swapfile
    
      btrfs subvol snap swappy swapsnap
      btrfs subvol del -C swapsnap
    
      btrfs fi sync /
      sync;sync;sync
    
      swapon swappy/swapfile
    
    The fix is to just use args->strict, and everyone except swapfile
    activation is passing false.

    btrfs: fix iomap_begin length for nocow writes
    
    commit 7833b865953c8e62abc76a3261c04132b2fb69de upstream.
    
    can_nocow_extent can reduce the len passed in, which needs to be
    propagated to btrfs_dio_iomap_begin so that iomap does not submit
    more data then is mapped.
    
    This problems exists since the btrfs_get_blocks_direct helper was added
    in commit c5794e51784a ("btrfs: Factor out write portion of
    btrfs_get_blocks_direct"), but the ordered_extent splitting added in
    commit b73a6fd1b1ef ("btrfs: split partial dio bios before submit")
    added a WARN_ON that made a syzkaller test fail.

    [CAUSE]
    Since the introduction of global roots, we handle
    csum/extent/free-space-tree roots as global roots, even if no
    extent-tree-v2 feature is enabled.
    
    So for regular csum/extent/fst roots, we load them into
    fs_info::global_root_tree rb tree.
    
    And we should not expect any conflicts in that rb tree, thus we have an
    ASSERT() inside btrfs_global_root_insert().
    
    But rescue=usebackuproot can break the assumption, as we will try to
    load those trees again and again as long as we have bad roots and have
    backup roots slot remaining.
    
    So in that case we can have conflicting roots in the rb tree, and
    triggering the ASSERT() crash.
    
    [FIX]
    We can safely remove that ASSERT(), as the caller will properly put the
    offending root.
    
    To make further debugging easier, also add two explicit error messages:
    
    - Error message for conflicting global roots
    - Error message when using backup roots slot

    kexec: support purgatories with .text.hot sections
    
    commit 8652d44f466ad5772e7d1756e9457046189b0dfc upstream.
    
    Patch series "kexec: Fix kexec_file_load for llvm16 with PGO", v7.
    
    When upreving llvm I realised that kexec stopped working on my test
    platform.
    
    The reason seems to be that due to PGO there are multiple .text sections
    on the purgatory, and kexec does not supports that.
    
    
    This patch (of 4):
    
    Clang16 links the purgatory text in two sections when PGO is in use:
    
      [ 1] .text             PROGBITS         0000000000000000  00000040
           00000000000011a1  0000000000000000  AX       0     0     16
      [ 2] .rela.text        RELA             0000000000000000  00003498
           0000000000000648  0000000000000018   I      24     1     8
      ...
      [17] .text.hot.        PROGBITS         0000000000000000  00003220
           000000000000020b  0000000000000000  AX       0     0     1
      [18] .rela.text.hot.   RELA             0000000000000000  00004428
           0000000000000078  0000000000000018   I      24    17     8
    
    And both of them have their range [sh_addr ... sh_addr+sh_size] on the
    area pointed by `e_entry`.
    
    This causes that image->start is calculated twice, once for .text and
    another time for .text.hot. The second calculation leaves image->start
    in a random location.

    io_uring/net: save msghdr->msg_control for retries
    
    commit cac9e4418f4cbd548ccb065b3adcafe073f7f7d2 upstream.
    
    If the application sets ->msg_control and we have to later retry this
    command, or if it got queued with IOSQE_ASYNC to begin with, then we
    need to retain the original msg_control value. This is due to the net
    stack overwriting this field with an in-kernel pointer, to copy it
    in. Hitting that path for the second time will now fail the copy from
    user, as it's attempting to copy from a non-user address.

    nilfs2: reject devices with insufficient block count
    
    commit 92c5d1b860e9581d64baca76779576c0ab0d943d upstream.
    
    The current sanity check for nilfs2 geometry information lacks checks for
    the number of segments stored in superblocks, so even for device images
    that have been destructively truncated or have an unusually high number of
    segments, the mount operation may succeed.
    
    This causes out-of-bounds block I/O on file system block reads or log
    writes to the segments, the latter in particular causing
    "a_ops->writepages" to repeatedly fail, resulting in sync_inodes_sb() to
    hang.
    
    Fix this issue by checking the number of segments stored in the superblock
    and avoiding mounting devices that can cause out-of-bounds accesses.  To
    eliminate the possibility of overflow when calculating the number of
    blocks required for the device from the number of segments, this also adds
    a helper function to calculate the upper bound on the number of segments
    and inserts a check using it.

    nilfs2: fix possible out-of-bounds segment allocation in resize ioctl
    
    commit fee5eaecca86afa544355569b831c1f90f334b85 upstream.
    
    Syzbot reports that in its stress test for resize ioctl, the log writing
    function nilfs_segctor_do_construct hits a WARN_ON in
    nilfs_segctor_truncate_segments().
    
    It turned out that there is a problem with the current implementation of
    the resize ioctl, which changes the writable range on the device (the
    range of allocatable segments) at the end of the resize process.
    
    This order is necessary for file system expansion to avoid corrupting the
    superblock at trailing edge.  However, in the case of a file system
    shrink, if log writes occur after truncating out-of-bounds trailing
    segments and before the resize is complete, segments may be allocated from
    the truncated space.
    
    The userspace resize tool was fine as it limits the range of allocatable
    segments before performing the resize, but it can run into this issue if
    the resize ioctl is called alone.
    
    Fix this issue by changing nilfs_sufile_resize() to update the range of
    allocatable segments immediately after successful truncation of segment
    space in case of file system shrink.

    nilfs2: fix incomplete buffer cleanup in nilfs_btnode_abort_change_key()
    
    commit 2f012f2baca140c488e43d27a374029c1e59098d upstream.
    
    A syzbot fault injection test reported that nilfs_btnode_create_block, a
    helper function that allocates a new node block for b-trees, causes a
    kernel BUG for disk images where the file system block size is smaller
    than the page size.
    
    This was due to unexpected flags on the newly allocated buffer head, and
    it turned out to be because the buffer flags were not cleared by
    nilfs_btnode_abort_change_key() after an error occurred during a b-tree
    update operation and the buffer was later reused in that state.
    
    Fix this issue by using nilfs_btnode_delete() to abandon the unused
    preallocated buffer in nilfs_btnode_abort_change_key().

    zswap: do not shrink if cgroup may not zswap
    
    commit 0bdf0efa180a9cb1361cbded4e2260a49306ac89 upstream.
    
    Before storing a page, zswap first checks if the number of stored pages
    exceeds the limit specified by memory.zswap.max, for each cgroup in the
    hierarchy.  If this limit is reached or exceeded, then zswap shrinking is
    triggered and short-circuits the store attempt.
    
    However, since the zswap's LRU is not memcg-aware, this can create the
    following pathological behavior: the cgroup whose zswap limit is 0 will
    evict pages from other cgroups continually, without lowering its own zswap
    usage.  This means the shrinking will continue until the need for swap
    ceases or the pool becomes empty.
    
    As a result of this, we observe a disproportionate amount of zswap
    writeback and a perpetually small zswap pool in our experiments, even
    though the pool limit is never hit.
    
    More generally, a cgroup might unnecessarily evict pages from other
    cgroups before we drive the memcg back below its limit.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by rejecting zswap store attempt without
    shrinking the pool when obj_cgroup_may_zswap() returns false.

    When changing a file size with fallocate() the new size isn't being

    fstest generic/228 fail.  Simply adding a call to inode_newsize_ok() fixes

    ocfs2: fix use-after-free when unmounting read-only filesystem
    
    commit 50d927880e0f90d5cb25e897e9d03e5edacc79a8 upstream.
    
    It's trivial to trigger a use-after-free bug in the ocfs2 quotas code using
    fstest generic/452.  After a read-only remount, quotas are suspended and
    ocfs2_mem_dqinfo is freed through ->ocfs2_local_free_info().  When unmounting
    the filesystem, an UAF access to the oinfo will eventually cause a crash.

    irqchip/gic: Correctly validate OF quirk descriptors
    
    [ Upstream commit 91539341a3b6e9c868024a4292455dae36e6f58c ]
    
    When checking for OF quirks, make sure either 'compatible' or 'property'
    is set, and give up otherwise.
    
    This avoids non-OF quirks being randomly applied as they don't have any
    of the OF data that need checking.

    io_uring: unlock sqd->lock before sq thread release CPU
    
    [ Upstream commit 533ab73f5b5c95dcb4152b52d5482abcc824c690 ]
    
    The sq thread actively releases CPU resources by calling the
    cond_resched() and schedule() interfaces when it is idle. Therefore,
    more resources are available for other threads to run.
    
    There exists a problem in sq thread: it does not unlock sqd->lock before
    releasing CPU resources every time. This makes other threads pending on
    sqd->lock for a long time. For example, the following interfaces all
    require sqd->lock: io_sq_offload_create(), io_register_iowq_max_workers()
    and io_ring_exit_work().
    
    Before the sq thread releases CPU resources, unlocking sqd->lock will
    provide the user a better experience because it can respond quickly to
    user requests.

    xen/blkfront: Only check REQ_FUA for writes
    
    [ Upstream commit b6ebaa8100090092aa602530d7e8316816d0c98d ]
    
    The existing code silently converts read operations with the
    REQ_FUA bit set into write-barrier operations. This results in data
    loss as the backend scribbles zeroes over the data instead of returning
    it.
    
    While the REQ_FUA bit doesn't make sense on a read operation, at least
    one well-known out-of-tree kernel module does set it and since it
    results in data loss, let's be safe here and only look at REQ_FUA for
    writes.

    It happens because of play_dma_data/capture_dma_data pointers are NULL.
    Current implementation assigns these pointers at snd_soc_dai_driver
    startup() callback and reset them back to NULL at shutdown(). But
    soc_pcm_open() sequence uses DMA pointers in dmaengine_pcm_open()
    before snd_soc_dai_driver startup().
    Most generic DMA capable I2S drivers use snd_soc_dai_driver probe()
    callback to init DMA pointers only once at probe. So move DMA init
    to dw_i2s_dai_probe and drop shutdown() and startup() callbacks.

    ASoC: soc-pcm: test if a BE can be prepared
    
    [ Upstream commit e123036be377ddf628226a7c6d4f9af5efd113d3 ]
    
    In the BE hw_params configuration, the existing code checks if any of the
    existing FEs are prepared, running, paused or suspended - and skips the
    configuration in those cases. This allows multiple calls of hw_params
    which the ALSA state machine supports.
    
    This check is not handled for the prepare stage, which can lead to the
    same BE being prepared multiple times. This patch adds a check similar to
    that of the hw_params, with the main difference being that the suspended
    state is allowed: the ALSA state machine allows a transition from
    suspended to prepared with hw_params skipped.
    
    This problem was detected on Intel IPC4/SoundWire devices, where the BE
    dailink .prepare stage is used to configure the SoundWire stream with a
    bank switch. Multiple .prepare calls lead to conflicts with the .trigger
    operation with IPC4 configurations. This problem was not detected earlier
    on Intel devices, HDaudio BE dailinks detect that the link is already
    prepared and skip the configuration, and for IPC3 devices there is no BE
    trigger.

    btrfs: handle memory allocation failure in btrfs_csum_one_bio
    
    [ Upstream commit 806570c0bb7b4847828c22c4934fcf2dc8fc572f ]
    
    Since f8a53bb58ec7 ("btrfs: handle checksum generation in the storage
    layer") the failures of btrfs_csum_one_bio() are handled via
    bio_end_io().
    
    This means, we can return BLK_STS_RESOURCE from btrfs_csum_one_bio() in
    case the allocation of the ordered sums fails.
    
    This also fixes a syzkaller report, where injecting a failure into the
    kvzalloc() call results in a BUG_ON().

    btrfs: scrub: try harder to mark RAID56 block groups read-only
    
    [ Upstream commit 7561551e7ba870b9659083b95feb520fb2dacce3 ]
    
    Currently we allow a block group not to be marked read-only for scrub.
    
    But for RAID56 block groups if we require the block group to be
    read-only, then we're allowed to use cached content from scrub stripe to
    reduce unnecessary RAID56 reads.
    
    So this patch would:
    
    - Make btrfs_inc_block_group_ro() try harder
      During my tests, for cases like btrfs/061 and btrfs/064, we can hit
      ENOSPC from btrfs_inc_block_group_ro() calls during scrub.
    
      The reason is if we only have one single data chunk, and trying to
      scrub it, we won't have any space left for any newer data writes.
    
      But this check should be done by the caller, especially for scrub
      cases we only temporarily mark the chunk read-only.
      And newer data writes would always try to allocate a new data chunk
      when needed.
    
    - Return error for scrub if we failed to mark a RAID56 chunk read-only

    power: supply: Fix logic checking if system is running from battery
    
    [ Upstream commit 95339f40a8b652b5b1773def31e63fc53c26378a ]
    
    The logic used for power_supply_is_system_supplied() counts all power
    supplies and assumes that the system is running from AC if there is
    either a non-battery power-supply reporting to be online or if no
    power-supplies exist at all.
    
    The second rule is for desktop systems, that don't have any
    battery/charger devices. These systems will incorrectly report to be
    powered from battery once a device scope power-supply is registered
    (e.g. a HID device), since these power-supplies increase the counter.
    
    Apart from HID devices, recent dGPUs provide UCSI power supplies on a
    desktop systems. The dGPU by default doesn't have anything plugged in so
    it's 'offline'. This makes power_supply_is_system_supplied() return 0
    with a count of 1 meaning all drivers that use this get a wrong judgement.
    
    To fix this case adjust the logic to also examine the scope of the power
    supply. If the power supply is deemed a device power supply, then don't
    count it.

    irqchip/gic-v3: Disable pseudo NMIs on Mediatek devices w/ firmware issues
    
    [ Upstream commit 44bd78dd2b8897f59b7e3963f088caadb7e4f047 ]
    
    Some Chromebooks with Mediatek SoCs have a problem where the firmware
    doesn't properly save/restore certain GICR registers. Newer
    Chromebooks should fix this issue and we may be able to do firmware
    updates for old Chromebooks. At the moment, the only known issue with
    these Chromebooks is that we can't enable "pseudo NMIs" since the
    priority register can be lost. Enabling "pseudo NMIs" on Chromebooks
    with the problematic firmware causes crashes and freezes.
    
    Let's detect devices with this problem and then disable "pseudo NMIs"
    on them. We'll detect the problem by looking for the presence of the
    "mediatek,broken-save-restore-fw" property in the GIC device tree
    node. Any devices with fixed firmware will not have this property.
    
    Our detection plan works because we never bake a Chromebook's device
    tree into firmware. Instead, device trees are always bundled with the
    kernel. We'll update the device trees of all affected Chromebooks and
    then we'll never enable "pseudo NMI" on a kernel that is bundled with
    old device trees. When a firmware update is shipped that fixes this
    issue it will know to patch the device tree to remove the property.
    
    In order to make this work, the quick detection mechanism of the GICv3
    code is extended to be able to look for properties in addition to
    looking at "compatible".

    complaints like:
    
      DPC: RP PIO log size 0 is invalid
    
    and also enables the DPC driver to dump the RP PIO Log registers when DPC
    is triggered.

    Reduce the amount of output this dev_dbg() statement emits into logs,
    otherwise if system software polls the sysfs entry for data and keeps
    getting -ENODATA, it could end up filling the logs up.
    
    This does in fact make systemd journald choke, since during boot the
    sysfs power supply entries are polled and if journald starts at the
    same time, the journal is just being repeatedly filled up, and the
    system stops on trying to start journald without booting any further.

    sc27xx_fgu_external_power_changed() dereferences data->battery,
    which gets sets in ab8500_btemp_probe() like this:
    
            data->battery = devm_power_supply_register(dev, &sc27xx_fgu_desc,
                                                       &fgu_cfg);
    
    As soon as devm_power_supply_register() has called device_add()
    the external_power_changed callback can get called. So there is a window
    where sc27xx_fgu_external_power_changed() may get called while
    data->battery has not been set yet leading to a NULL pointer dereference.
    
    Fixing this is easy. The external_power_changed callback gets passed
    the power_supply which will eventually get stored in data->battery,
    so sc27xx_fgu_external_power_changed() can simply directly use
    the passed in psy argument which is always valid.
    
    After this change sc27xx_fgu_external_power_changed() is reduced to just
    "power_supply_changed(psy);" and it has the same prototype. While at it
    simply replace it with making the external_power_changed callback
    directly point to power_supply_changed.

    the power_supply which will eventually get stored in di->btemp_psy,
    so ab8500_btemp_external_power_changed() can simply directly use
    the passed in psy argument which is always valid.
    
    And the same applies to ab8500_fg_external_power_changed().

    EDAC/qcom: Get rid of hardcoded register offsets
    
    [ Upstream commit cbd77119b6355872cd308a60e99f9ca678435d15 ]
    
    The LLCC EDAC register offsets varies between each SoC. Hardcoding the
    register offsets won't work and will often result in crash due to
    accessing the wrong locations.
    
    Hence, get the register offsets from the LLCC driver matching the
    individual SoCs.

    qcom: llcc/edac: Fix the base address used for accessing LLCC banks
    
    [ Upstream commit ee13b5008707948d3052c1b5aab485c6cd53658e ]
    
    The Qualcomm LLCC/EDAC drivers were using a fixed register stride for
    accessing the (Control and Status Registers) CSRs of each LLCC bank.
    This stride only works for some SoCs like SDM845 for which driver
    support was initially added.
    
    But the later SoCs use different register stride that vary between the
    banks with holes in-between. So it is not possible to use a single register
    stride for accessing the CSRs of each bank. By doing so could result in a
    crash.
    
    For fixing this issue, let's obtain the base address of each LLCC bank from
    devicetree and get rid of the fixed stride. This also means, there is no
    need to rely on reg-names property and the base addresses can be obtained
    using the index.
    
    First index is LLCC bank 0 and last index is LLCC broadcast. If the SoC
    supports more than one bank, then those need to be defined in devicetree
    for index from 1..N-1.

    cgroup: always put cset in cgroup_css_set_put_fork
    
    [ Upstream commit 2bd110339288c18823dcace602b63b0d8627e520 ]
    
    A successful call to cgroup_css_set_fork() will always have taken
    a ref on kargs->cset (regardless of CLONE_INTO_CGROUP), so always
    do a corresponding put in cgroup_css_set_put_fork().
    
    Without this, a cset and its contained css structures will be
    leaked for some fork failures.  The following script reproduces
    the leak for a fork failure due to exceeding pids.max in the
    pids controller.  A similar thing can happen if we jump to the
    bad_fork_cancel_cgroup label in copy_process().

    test_firmware: prevent race conditions by a correct implementation of locking
    
    [ Upstream commit 4acfe3dfde685a5a9eaec5555351918e2d7266a1 ]
    
    Dan Carpenter spotted a race condition in a couple of situations like
    these in the test_firmware driver:
    
    static int test_dev_config_update_u8(const char *buf, size_t size, u8 *cfg)
    {
            u8 val;
            int ret;
    
            ret = kstrtou8(buf, 10, &val);
            if (ret)
                    return ret;
    
            mutex_lock(&test_fw_mutex);
            *(u8 *)cfg = val;
            mutex_unlock(&test_fw_mutex);
    
            /* Always return full write size even if we didn't consume all */
            return size;
    }
    
    static ssize_t config_num_requests_store(struct device *dev,
                                             struct device_attribute *attr,
                                             const char *buf, size_t count)
    {
            int rc;
    
            mutex_lock(&test_fw_mutex);
            if (test_fw_config->reqs) {
                    pr_err("Must call release_all_firmware prior to changing config\n");
                    rc = -EINVAL;
                    mutex_unlock(&test_fw_mutex);
                    goto out;
            }
            mutex_unlock(&test_fw_mutex);
    
            rc = test_dev_config_update_u8(buf, count,
                                           &test_fw_config->num_requests);
    
    out:
            return rc;
    }
    
    static ssize_t config_read_fw_idx_store(struct device *dev,
                                            struct device_attribute *attr,
                                            const char *buf, size_t count)
    {
            return test_dev_config_update_u8(buf, count,
                                             &test_fw_config->read_fw_idx);
    }
    
    The function test_dev_config_update_u8() is called from both the locked
    and the unlocked context, function config_num_requests_store() and
    config_read_fw_idx_store() which can both be called asynchronously as
    they are driver's methods, while test_dev_config_update_u8() and siblings
    change their argument pointed to by u8 *cfg or similar pointer.
    
    To avoid deadlock on test_fw_mutex, the lock is dropped before calling
    test_dev_config_update_u8() and re-acquired within test_dev_config_update_u8()
    itself, but alas this creates a race condition.
    
    Having two locks wouldn't assure a race-proof mutual exclusion.
    
    This situation is best avoided by the introduction of a new, unlocked
    function __test_dev_config_update_u8() which can be called from the locked
    context and reducing test_dev_config_update_u8() to:
    
    static int test_dev_config_update_u8(const char *buf, size_t size, u8 *cfg)
    {
            int ret;
    
            mutex_lock(&test_fw_mutex);
            ret = __test_dev_config_update_u8(buf, size, cfg);
            mutex_unlock(&test_fw_mutex);
    
            return ret;
    }
    
    doing the locking and calling the unlocked primitive, which enables both
    locked and unlocked versions without duplication of code.
    
    The similar approach was applied to all functions called from the locked
    and the unlocked context, which safely mitigates both deadlocks and race
    conditions in the driver.
    
    __test_dev_config_update_bool(), __test_dev_config_update_u8() and
    __test_dev_config_update_size_t() unlocked versions of the functions
    were introduced to be called from the locked contexts as a workaround
    without releasing the main driver's lock and thereof causing a race
    condition.
    
    The test_dev_config_update_bool(), test_dev_config_update_u8() and
    test_dev_config_update_size_t() locked versions of the functions
    are being called from driver methods without the unnecessary multiplying
    of the locking and unlocking code for each method, and complicating
    the code with saving of the return value across lock.

    x86/head/64: Switch to KERNEL_CS as soon as new GDT is installed
    
    [ Upstream commit a37f2699c36a7f6606ba3300f243227856c5ad6b ]
    
    The call to startup_64_setup_env() will install a new GDT but does not
    actually switch to using the KERNEL_CS entry until returning from the
    function call.
    
    Commit bcce82908333 ("x86/sev: Detect/setup SEV/SME features earlier in
    boot") moved the call to sme_enable() earlier in the boot process and in
    between the call to startup_64_setup_env() and the switch to KERNEL_CS.
    An SEV-ES or an SEV-SNP guest will trigger #VC exceptions during the call
    to sme_enable() and if the CS pushed on the stack as part of the exception
    and used by IRETQ is not mapped by the new GDT, then problems occur.
    Today, the current CS when entering startup_64 is the kernel CS value
    because it was set up by the decompressor code, so no issue is seen.
    
    However, a recent patchset that looked to avoid using the legacy
    decompressor during an EFI boot exposed this bug. At entry to startup_64,
    the CS value is that of EFI and is not mapped in the new kernel GDT. So
    when a #VC exception occurs, the CS value used by IRETQ is not valid and
    the guest boot crashes.
    
    Fix this issue by moving the block that switches to the KERNEL_CS value to
    be done immediately after returning from startup_64_setup_env().
