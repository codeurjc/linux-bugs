    ALSA: usb-audio: Add quirk for Audient iD14
    
    commit df0380b9539b04c1ae8854a984098da06d5f1e67 upstream.
    
    Audient iD14 (2708:0002) may get a control message error that
    interferes the operation e.g. with alsactl.  Add the quirk to ignore
    such errors like other devices.

    Revert "drm/i915/gt: Propagate change in error status to children on unhold"
    
    commit ac653dd7996edf1770959e11a078312928bd7315 upstream.
    
    Propagating errors to dependent fences is broken and can lead to errors
    from one client ending up in another. In commit 3761baae908a ("Revert
    "drm/i915: Propagate errors on awaiting already signaled fences""), we
    attempted to get rid of fence error propagation but missed the case
    added in commit 8e9f84cf5cac ("drm/i915/gt: Propagate change in error
    status to children on unhold"). Revert that one too. This error was
    found by an up-and-coming selftest which triggers a reset during
    request cancellation and verifies that subsequent requests complete
    successfully.

    ARM: 9120/1: Revert "amba: make use of -1 IRQs warn"
    
    commit eb4f756915875b0ea0757751cd29841f0504d547 upstream.
    
    After commit 77a7300abad7 ("of/irq: Get rid of NO_IRQ usage"),
    no irq case has been removed, irq_of_parse_and_map() will return
    0 in all cases when get error from parse and map an interrupt into
    linux virq space.
    
    amba_device_register() is only used on no-DT initialization, see
      s3c64xx_pl080_init()          arch/arm/mach-s3c/pl080.c
      ep93xx_init_devices()         arch/arm/mach-ep93xx/core.c
    
    They won't set -1 to irq[0], so no need the warn.

    commit 2b2f106eb55276a60a89ac27a52d0d738b57a546 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit a77ebdd9f553. It turns out that the VPU domain has no
    different requirements, even though the downstream ATF implementation seems
    to suggest otherwise. Powering on the domain with the reset asserted works
    fine. As the changed sequence has caused sporadic issues with the GPU
    domains, just revert the change to go back to the working sequence.

    media: firewire: firedtv-avc: fix a buffer overflow in avc_ca_pmt()
    
    commit 35d2969ea3c7d32aee78066b1f3cf61a0d935a4e upstream.
    
    The bounds checking in avc_ca_pmt() is not strict enough.  It should
    be checking "read_pos + 4" because it's reading 5 bytes.  If the
    "es_info_length" is non-zero then it reads a 6th byte so there needs to
    be an additional check for that.
    
    I also added checks for the "write_pos".  I don't think these are
    required because "read_pos" and "write_pos" are tied together so
    checking one ought to be enough.  But they make the code easier to
    understand for me.  The check on write_pos is:
    
            if (write_pos + 4 >= sizeof(c->operand) - 4) {
    
    The first "+ 4" is because we're writing 5 bytes and the last " - 4"
    is to leave space for the CRC.
    
    The other problem is that "length" can be invalid.  It comes from
    "data_length" in fdtv_ca_pmt().

    sfc: Fix reading non-legacy supported link modes
    
    commit 041c61488236a5a84789083e3d9f0a51139b6edf upstream.
    
    Everything except the first 32 bits was lost when the pause flags were
    added. This makes the 50000baseCR2 mode flag (bit 34) not appear.
    
    I have tested this with a 10G card (SFN5122F-R7) by modifying it to
    return a non-legacy link mode (10000baseCR).
