    x86/pat: Fix x86_has_pat_wp()
    
    commit 230ec83d4299b30c51a1c133b4f2a669972cc08a upstream.
    
    x86_has_pat_wp() is using a wrong test, as it relies on the normal
    PAT configuration used by the kernel. In case the PAT MSR has been
    setup by another entity (e.g. Xen hypervisor) it might return false
    even if the PAT configuration is allowing WP mappings. This due to the
    fact that when running as Xen PV guest the PAT MSR is setup by the
    hypervisor and cannot be changed by the guest. This results in the WP
    related entry to be at a different position when running as Xen PV
    guest compared to the bare metal or fully virtualized case.
    
    The correct way to test for WP support is:
    
    1. Get the PTE protection bits needed to select WP mode by reading
       __cachemode2pte_tbl[_PAGE_CACHE_MODE_WP] (depending on the PAT MSR
       setting this might return protection bits for a stronger mode, e.g.
       UC-)
    2. Translate those bits back into the real cache mode selected by those
       PTE bits by reading __pte2cachemode_tbl[__pte2cm_idx(prot)]
    3. Test for the cache mode to be _PAGE_CACHE_MODE_WP

    serial: 8250: Fix PM usage_count for console handover
    
    commit f9b11229b79c0fb2100b5bb4628a101b1d37fbf6 upstream.
    
    When console is enabled, univ8250_console_setup() calls
    serial8250_console_setup() before .dev is set to uart_port. Therefore,
    it will not call pm_runtime_get_sync(). Later, when the actual driver
    is going to take over univ8250_console_exit() is called. As .dev is
    already set, serial8250_console_exit() makes pm_runtime_put_sync() call
    with usage count being zero triggering PM usage count warning
    (extra debug for univ8250_console_setup(), univ8250_console_exit(), and
    serial8250_register_ports()):
    
    [    0.068987] univ8250_console_setup ttyS0 nodev
    [    0.499670] printk: console [ttyS0] enabled

    [    1.978167] printk: console [ttyS0] printing thread started
    [    1.978203] printk: console [ttyS0] enabled
    
    To fix the issue, call pm_runtime_get_sync() in
    serial8250_register_ports() as soon as .dev is set for an uart_port
    if it has console enabled.
    
    This problem became apparent only recently because 82586a721595 ("PM:
    runtime: Avoid device usage count underflows") added the warning
    printout. I confirmed this problem also occurs with v5.18 (w/o the
    warning printout, obviously).

    vt: fix memory overlapping when deleting chars in the buffer
    
    commit 39cdb68c64d84e71a4a717000b6e5de208ee60cc upstream.
    
    A memory overlapping copy occurs when deleting a long line. This memory
    overlapping copy can cause data corruption when scr_memcpyw is optimized
    to memcpy because memcpy does not ensure its behavior if the destination
    buffer overlaps with the source buffer. The line buffer is not always
    broken, because the memcpy utilizes the hardware acceleration, whose
    result is not deterministic.
    
    Fix this problem by using replacing the scr_memcpyw with scr_memmovew.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix event pending check
    
    commit 7441b273388b9a59d8387a03ffbbca9d5af6348c upstream.
    
    The DWC3_EVENT_PENDING flag is used to protect against invalid call to
    top-half interrupt handler, which can occur when there's a delay in
    software detection of the interrupt line deassertion.
    
    However, the clearing of this flag was done prior to unmasking the
    interrupt line, creating opportunity where the top-half handler can
    come. This breaks the serialization and creates a race between the
    top-half and bottom-half handler, resulting in losing synchronization
    between the controller and the driver when processing events.
    
    To fix this, make sure the clearing of the DWC3_EVENT_PENDING is done at
    the end of the bottom-half handler.

    signal handling: don't use BUG_ON() for debugging
    
    [ Upstream commit a382f8fee42ca10c9bfce0d2352d4153f931f5dc ]
    
    These are indeed "should not happen" situations, but it turns out recent
    changes made the 'task_is_stopped_or_trace()' case trigger (fix for that
    exists, is pending more testing), and the BUG_ON() makes it
    unnecessarily hard to actually debug for no good reason.
    
    It's been that way for a long time, but let's make it clear: BUG_ON() is
    not good for debugging, and should never be used in situations where you
    could just say "this shouldn't happen, but we can continue".
    
    Use WARN_ON_ONCE() instead to make sure it gets logged, and then just
    continue running.  Instead of making the system basically unusuable
    because you crashed the machine while potentially holding some very core
    locks (eg this function is commonly called while holding 'tasklist_lock'
    for writing).

    [ Upstream commit 38fa5479b41376dc9d7f57e71c83514285a25ca0 ]
    
    The .brk section has the same properties as .bss: it is an alloc-only
    section and should be cleared before being used.
    
    Not doing so is especially a problem for Xen PV guests, as the
    hypervisor will validate page tables (check for writable page tables
    and hypervisor private bits) before accepting them to be used.
    
    Make sure .brk is initially zero by letting clear_bss() clear the brk

    irqchip: or1k-pic: Undefine mask_ack for level triggered hardware
    
    [ Upstream commit 8520501346ed8d1c4a6dfa751cb57328a9c843f1 ]
    
    The mask_ack operation clears the interrupt by writing to the PICSR
    register.  This we don't want for level triggered interrupt because
    it does not actually clear the interrupt on the source hardware.
    
    This was causing issues in qemu with multi core setups where
    interrupts would continue to fire even though they had been cleared in

    ASoC: dapm: Initialise kcontrol data for mux/demux controls
    
    [ Upstream commit 11d7a12f7f50baa5af9090b131c9b03af59503e7 ]
    
    DAPM keeps a copy of the current value of mux/demux controls,
    however this value is only initialised in the case of autodisable
    controls. This leads to false notification events when first
    modifying a DAPM kcontrol that has a non-zero default.
    
    Autodisable controls are left as they are, since they already
    initialise the value, and there would be more work required to
    support autodisable muxes where the first option isn't disabled
    and/or that isn't the default.
    
    Technically this issue could affect mixer/switch elements as well,
    although not on any of the devices I am currently running. There
    is also a little more work to do to address the issue there due to
    that side supporting stereo controls, so that has not been tackled
    in this patch.

    nvme: fix regression when disconnect a recovering ctrl
    
    [ Upstream commit f7f70f4aa09dc43d7455c060143e86a017c30548 ]
    
    We encountered a problem that the disconnect command hangs.
    After analyzing the log and stack, we found that the triggering
    process is as follows:
    CPU0                          CPU1
                                    nvme_rdma_error_recovery_work
                                      nvme_rdma_teardown_io_queues
    nvme_do_delete_ctrl                 nvme_stop_queues
      nvme_remove_namespaces
      --clear ctrl->namespaces
                                        nvme_start_queues
                                        --no ns in ctrl->namespaces
        nvme_ns_remove                  return(because ctrl is deleting)
          blk_freeze_queue
            blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait
            --wait for ns to unquiesce to clean infligt IO, hang forever
    
    This problem was not found in older kernels because we will flush
    err work in nvme_stop_ctrl before nvme_remove_namespaces.It does not
    seem to be modified for functional reasons, the patch can be revert
    to solve the problem.

    queue stoppage and inflight requests cancellation is fully fenced from
    io_work and thus failing a request from this context. Hence we don't
    need to try to guess from the socket retcode if this failure is because
    the queue is about to be torn down or not.
    
    We are perfectly safe to just fail it, the request will not be cancelled
    later on.

    netfilter: br_netfilter: do not skip all hooks with 0 priority
    
    [ Upstream commit c2577862eeb0be94f151f2f1fff662b028061b00 ]
    
    When br_netfilter module is loaded, skbs may be diverted to the
    ipv4/ipv6 hooks, just like as if we were routing.
    
    Unfortunately, bridge filter hooks with priority 0 may be skipped
    in this case.
    
    Example:
    1. an nftables bridge ruleset is loaded, with a prerouting
       hook that has priority 0.
    2. interface is added to the bridge.
    3. no tcp packet is ever seen by the bridge prerouting hook.
    4. flush the ruleset
    5. load the bridge ruleset again.
    6. tcp packets are processed as expected.
    
    After 1) the only registered hook is the bridge prerouting hook, but its
    not called yet because the bridge hasn't been brought up yet.
    
    After 2), hook order is:
       0 br_nf_pre_routing // br_netfilter internal hook
       0 chain bridge f prerouting // nftables bridge ruleset
    
    The packet is diverted to br_nf_pre_routing.
    If call-iptables is off, the nftables bridge ruleset is called as expected.
    
    But if its enabled, br_nf_hook_thresh() will skip it because it assumes
    that all 0-priority hooks had been called previously in bridge context.
    
    To avoid this, check for the br_nf_pre_routing hook itself, we need to
    resume directly after it, even if this hook has a priority of 0.
    
    Unfortunately, this still results in different packet flow.
    With this fix, the eval order after in 3) is:
    1. br_nf_pre_routing
    2. ip(6)tables (if enabled)
    3. nftables bridge
    
    but after 5 its the much saner:
    1. nftables bridge
    2. br_nf_pre_routing
    3. ip(6)tables (if enabled)
    
    Unfortunately I don't see a solution here:
    It would be possible to move br_nf_pre_routing to a higher priority
    so that it will be called later in the pipeline, but this also impacts
    ebtables evaluation order, and would still result in this very ordering
    problem for all nftables-bridge hooks with the same priority as the
    br_nf_pre_routing one.
    
    Searching back through the git history I don't think this has
    ever behaved in any other way, hence, no fixes-tag.

    virtio_mmio: Restore guest page size on resume
    
    [ Upstream commit e0c2ce8217955537dd5434baeba061f209797119 ]
    
    Virtio devices might lose their state when the VMM is restarted
    after a suspend to disk (hibernation) cycle. This means that the
    guest page size register must be restored for the virtio_mmio legacy
    interface, since otherwise the virtio queues are not functional.
    
    This is particularly problematic for QEMU that currently still defaults
    to using the legacy interface for virtio_mmio. Write the guest page
    size register again in virtio_mmio_restore() to make legacy virtio_mmio
    devices work correctly after hibernation.

    resume. However, these callbacks are currently only called when using
    virtio_pci. virtio_mmio does not have any PM ops defined.
    
    This causes problems for example after suspend to disk (hibernation),
    since the virtio devices might lose their state after the VMM is
    restarted. Calling virtio_device_freeze()/restore() ensures that
    the virtio devices are re-initialized correctly.
    
    Fix this by implementing the dev_pm_ops for virtio_mmio,
    similar to virtio_pci_common.

    aq_nic_deinit() has been called while suspending, so we don't have to call
    it again on resume.
    Actually, call it again leads to another hang issue when resuming from

    sfc: fix kernel panic when creating VF
    
    [ Upstream commit ada74c5539eba06cf8b47d068f92e0b3963a9a6e ]
    
    When creating VFs a kernel panic can happen when calling to
    efx_ef10_try_update_nic_stats_vf.
    
    When releasing a DMA coherent buffer, sometimes, I don't know in what
    specific circumstances, it has to unmap memory with vunmap. It is
    disallowed to do that in IRQ context or with BH disabled. Otherwise, we
    hit this line in vunmap, causing the crash:
      BUG_ON(in_interrupt());
    
    This patch reenables BH to release the buffer.
    
    Log messages when the bug is hit:

    seg6: bpf: fix skb checksum in bpf_push_seg6_encap()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4889fbd98deaf243c3baadc54e296d71c6af1eb0 ]
    
    Both helper functions bpf_lwt_seg6_action() and bpf_lwt_push_encap() use
    the bpf_push_seg6_encap() to encapsulate the packet in an IPv6 with Segment
    Routing Header (SRH) or insert an SRH between the IPv6 header and the
    payload.
    To achieve this result, such helper functions rely on bpf_push_seg6_encap()
    which, in turn, leverages seg6_do_srh_{encap,inline}() to perform the
    required operation (i.e. encap/inline).
    
    This patch removes the initialization of the IPv6 header payload length
    from bpf_push_seg6_encap(), as it is now handled properly by
    seg6_do_srh_{encap,inline}() to prevent corruption of the skb checksum.

    seg6: fix skb checksum in SRv6 End.B6 and End.B6.Encaps behaviors
    
    [ Upstream commit f048880fc77058d864aff5c674af7918b30f312a ]
    
    The SRv6 End.B6 and End.B6.Encaps behaviors rely on functions
    seg6_do_srh_{encap,inline}() to, respectively: i) encapsulate the
    packet within an outer IPv6 header with the specified Segment Routing
    Header (SRH); ii) insert the specified SRH directly after the IPv6
    header of the packet.
    
    This patch removes the initialization of the IPv6 header payload length
    from the input_action_end_b6{_encap}() functions, as it is now handled
    properly by seg6_do_srh_{encap,inline}() to avoid corruption of the skb
    checksum.

    seg6: fix skb checksum evaluation in SRH encapsulation/insertion
    
    [ Upstream commit df8386d13ea280d55beee1b95f61a59234a3798b ]
    
    Support for SRH encapsulation and insertion was introduced with
    commit 6c8702c60b88 ("ipv6: sr: add support for SRH encapsulation and
    injection with lwtunnels"), through the seg6_do_srh_encap() and
    seg6_do_srh_inline() functions, respectively.
    The former encapsulates the packet in an outer IPv6 header along with
    the SRH, while the latter inserts the SRH between the IPv6 header and
    the payload. Then, the headers are initialized/updated according to the
    operating mode (i.e., encap/inline).
    Finally, the skb checksum is calculated to reflect the changes applied
    to the headers.
    
    The IPv6 payload length ('payload_len') is not initialized
    within seg6_do_srh_{inline,encap}() but is deferred in seg6_do_srh(), i.e.
    the caller of seg6_do_srh_{inline,encap}().
    However, this operation invalidates the skb checksum, since the
    'payload_len' is updated only after the checksum is evaluated.
    
    To solve this issue, the initialization of the IPv6 payload length is
    moved from seg6_do_srh() directly into the seg6_do_srh_{inline,encap}()
    functions and before the skb checksum update takes place.

    without freeing the ima_algo_array. Add the missing kfree() for
    ima_algo_array to avoid the potential memory leak.

    ima: force signature verification when CONFIG_KEXEC_SIG is configured
    
    [ Upstream commit af16df54b89dee72df253abc5e7b5e8a6d16c11c ]
    
    Currently, an unsigned kernel could be kexec'ed when IMA arch specific
    policy is configured unless lockdown is enabled. Enforce kernel
    signature verification check in the kexec_file_load syscall when IMA
    arch specific policy is configured.

    drm/i915/gt: Serialize TLB invalidates with GT resets
    
    [ Upstream commit a1c5a7bf79c1faa5633b918b5c0666545e84c4d1 ]
    
    Avoid trying to invalidate the TLB in the middle of performing an
    engine reset, as this may result in the reset timing out. Currently,
    the TLB invalidate is only serialised by its own mutex, forgoing the
    uncore lock, but we can take the uncore->lock as well to serialise
    the mmio access, thereby serialising with the GDRST.

    sysctl: Fix data races in proc_dointvec_minmax().
    
    [ Upstream commit f613d86d014b6375a4085901de39406598121e35 ]
    
    A sysctl variable is accessed concurrently, and there is always a chance
    of data-race.  So, all readers and writers need some basic protection to
    avoid load/store-tearing.
    
    This patch changes proc_dointvec_minmax() to use READ_ONCE() and
    WRITE_ONCE() internally to fix data-races on the sysctl side.  For now,
    proc_dointvec_minmax() itself is tolerant to a data-race, but we still
    need to add annotations on the other subsystem's side.

    net: stmmac: dwc-qos: Disable split header for Tegra194
    
    [ Upstream commit 029c1c2059e9c4b38f97a06204cdecd10cfbeb8a ]
    
    There is a long-standing issue with the Synopsys DWC Ethernet driver
    for Tegra194 where random system crashes have been observed [0]. The
    problem occurs when the split header feature is enabled in the stmmac
    driver. In the bad case, a larger than expected buffer length is
    received and causes the calculation of the total buffer length to
    overflow. This results in a very large buffer length that causes the
    kernel to crash. Why this larger buffer length is received is not clear,
    however, the feedback from the NVIDIA design team is that the split
    header feature is not supported for Tegra194. Therefore, disable split
    header support for Tegra194 to prevent these random crashes from
    occurring.

    The struct nhlt_format's fmt_config is a flexible array, it must not be

    When moving to the next nhlt_fmt_cfg we need to take into account the data
    behind the ->config.caps (indicated by ->config.size).

    Put the SGTL5000 in a silent/safe state on shutdown/remove, this is

    this is happening every time the module is unbound/removed or from

    The issue was experienced on both a Toradex Colibri/Apalis iMX6, but can
    be easily reproduced everywhere just playing something on the codec and
    after that removing/unbinding the driver.

    ARM: 9210/1: Mark the FDT_FIXED sections as shareable
    
    [ Upstream commit 598f0a99fa8a35be44b27106b43ddc66417af3b1 ]
    
    commit 7a1be318f579 ("ARM: 9012/1: move device tree mapping out of linear
    region") use FDT_FIXED_BASE to map the whole FDT_FIXED_SIZE memory area
    which contains fdt. But it only reserves the exact physical memory that
    fdt occupied. Unfortunately, this mapping is non-shareable. An illegal or
    speculative read access can bring the RAM content from non-fdt zone into
    cache, PIPT makes it to be hit by subsequently read access through
    shareable mapping(such as linear mapping), and the cache consistency
    between cores is lost due to non-shareable property.
    
    |<---------FDT_FIXED_SIZE------>|
    |                               |
     -------------------------------
    | <non-fdt> | <fdt> | <non-fdt> |
     -------------------------------
    
    1. CoreA read <non-fdt> through MT_ROM mapping, the old data is loaded
       into the cache.
    2. CoreB write <non-fdt> to update data through linear mapping. CoreA
       received the notification to invalid the corresponding cachelines, but
       the property non-shareable makes it to be ignored.
    3. CoreA read <non-fdt> through linear mapping, cache hit, the old data
       is read.
    
    To eliminate this risk, add a new memory type MT_MEMORY_RO. Compared to
    MT_ROM, it is shareable and non-executable.

    ARM: 9209/1: Spectre-BHB: avoid pr_info() every time a CPU comes out of idle
    
    [ Upstream commit 0609e200246bfd3b7516091c491bec4308349055 ]
    
    Jon reports that the Spectre-BHB init code is filling up the kernel log
    with spurious notifications about which mitigation has been enabled,
    every time any CPU comes out of a low power state.
    
    Given that Spectre-BHB mitigations are system wide, only a single
    mitigation can be enabled, and we already print an error if two types of
    CPUs coexist in a single system that require different Spectre-BHB
    mitigations.
    
    This means that the pr_info() that describes the selected mitigation
    does not need to be emitted for each CPU anyway, and so we can simply
    emit it only once.
    
    In order to clarify the above in the log message, update it to describe
    that the selected mitigation will be enabled on all CPUs, including ones
    that are unaffected. If another CPU comes up later that is affected and
    requires a different mitigation, we report an error as before.

    spi: amd: Limit max transfer and message size
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ece49c56965544262523dae4a071ace3db63507 ]
    
    Enabling the SPI CS35L41 audio codec driver for Steam Deck [1]
    revealed a problem with the current AMD SPI controller driver
    implementation, consisting of an unrecoverable system hang.
    
    The issue can be prevented if we ensure the max transfer size
    and the max message size do not exceed the FIFO buffer size.
    
    According to the implementation of the downstream driver, the
    AMD SPI controller is not able to handle more than 70 bytes per
    transfer, which corresponds to the size of the FIFO buffer.
    
    Hence, let's fix this by setting the SPI limits mentioned above.

    Revert "evm: Fix memleak in init_desc"
    
    commit 51dd64bb99e4478fc5280171acd8e1b529eadaf7 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit ccf11dbaa07b328fa469415c362d33459c140a37.
    
    Commit ccf11dbaa07b ("evm: Fix memleak in init_desc") said there is
    memleak in init_desc. That may be incorrect, as we can see, tmp_tfm is
    saved in one of the two global variables hmac_tfm or evm_tfm[hash_algo],
    then if init_desc is called next time, there is no need to alloc tfm
    again, so in the error path of kmalloc desc or crypto_shash_init(desc),
    It is not a problem without freeing tmp_tfm.
    
    And also that commit did not reset the global variable to NULL after
    freeing tmp_tfm and this makes *tfm a dangling pointer which may cause a
    UAF issue.

    sh: convert nommu io{re,un}map() to static inline functions
    
    commit d684e0a52d36f8939eda30a0f31ee235ee4ee741 upstream.
    
    Recently, nommu iounmap() was converted from a static inline function to a
    macro again, basically reverting commit 4580ba4ad2e6b8dd ("sh: Convert
    iounmap() macros to inline functions").  With -Werror, this leads to build
    failures like:
    
        drivers/iio/adc/xilinx-ams.c: In function `ams_iounmap_ps':
        drivers/iio/adc/xilinx-ams.c:1195:14: error: unused variable `ams' [-Werror=unused-variable]
         1195 |  struct ams *ams = data;
              |              ^~~
    
    Fix this by replacing the macros for ioremap() and iounmap() by static
    inline functions, based on <asm-generic/io.h>.

    nilfs2: fix incorrect masking of permission flags for symlinks
    
    commit 5924e6ec1585445f251ea92713eb15beb732622a upstream.
    
    The permission flags of newly created symlinks are wrongly dropped on
    nilfs2 with the current umask value even though symlinks should have 777
    (rwxrwxrwx) permissions:
    
     $ umask
     0022
     $ touch file && ln -s file symlink; ls -l file symlink
     -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 0 Jun 23 16:29 file
     lrwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 4 Jun 23 16:29 symlink -> file
    
    This fixes the bug by inserting a missing check that excludes
    symlinks.

    fs/remap: constrain dedupe of EOF blocks
    
    commit 5750676b64a561f7ec920d7c6ba130fc9c7378f3 upstream.
    
    If dedupe of an EOF block is not constrainted to match against only
    other EOF blocks with the same EOF offset into the block, it can
    match against any other block that has the same matching initial
    bytes in it, even if the bytes beyond EOF in the source file do
    not match.
    
    Fix this by constraining the EOF block matching to only match
    against other EOF blocks that have identical EOF offsets and data.
    This allows "whole file dedupe" to continue to work without allowing
    eof blocks to randomly match against partial full blocks with the
    same data.

    btrfs: return -EAGAIN for NOWAIT dio reads/writes on compressed and inline extents
    
    commit a4527e1853f8ff6e0b7c2dadad6268bd38427a31 upstream.
    
    When doing a direct IO read or write, we always return -ENOTBLK when we
    find a compressed extent (or an inline extent) so that we fallback to
    buffered IO. This however is not ideal in case we are in a NOWAIT context
    (io_uring for example), because buffered IO can block and we currently
    have no support for NOWAIT semantics for buffered IO, so if we need to
    fallback to buffered IO we should first signal the caller that we may
    need to block by returning -EAGAIN instead.
    
    This behaviour can also result in short reads being returned to user
    space, which although it's not incorrect and user space should be able
    to deal with partial reads, it's somewhat surprising and even some popular
    applications like QEMU (Link tag #1) and MariaDB (Link tag #2) don't
    deal with short reads properly (or at all).
    
    The short read case happens when we try to read from a range that has a
    non-compressed and non-inline extent followed by a compressed extent.
    After having read the first extent, when we find the compressed extent we
    return -ENOTBLK from btrfs_dio_iomap_begin(), which results in iomap to
    treat the request as a short read, returning 0 (success) and waiting for
    previously submitted bios to complete (this happens at
    fs/iomap/direct-io.c:__iomap_dio_rw()). After that, and while at
    btrfs_file_read_iter(), we call filemap_read() to use buffered IO to
    read the remaining data, and pass it the number of bytes we were able to
    read with direct IO. Than at filemap_read() if we get a page fault error
    when accessing the read buffer, we return a partial read instead of an
    -EFAULT error, because the number of bytes previously read is greater

    So fix this by returning -EAGAIN for NOWAIT direct IO when we find a
    compressed or an inline extent.

    cgroup: Use separate src/dst nodes when preloading css_sets for migration
    
    commit 07fd5b6cdf3cc30bfde8fe0f644771688be04447 upstream.
    
    Each cset (css_set) is pinned by its tasks. When we're moving tasks around
    across csets for a migration, we need to hold the source and destination
    csets to ensure that they don't go away while we're moving tasks about. This
    is done by linking cset->mg_preload_node on either the
    mgctx->preloaded_src_csets or mgctx->preloaded_dst_csets list. Using the
    same cset->mg_preload_node for both the src and dst lists was deemed okay as
    a cset can't be both the source and destination at the same time.
    
    Unfortunately, this overloading becomes problematic when multiple tasks are
    involved in a migration and some of them are identity noop migrations while
    others are actually moving across cgroups. For example, this can happen with
    the following sequence on cgroup1:
    
     #1> mkdir -p /sys/fs/cgroup/misc/a/b
     #2> echo $$ > /sys/fs/cgroup/misc/a/cgroup.procs
     #3> RUN_A_COMMAND_WHICH_CREATES_MULTIPLE_THREADS &
     #4> PID=$!
     #5> echo $PID > /sys/fs/cgroup/misc/a/b/tasks
     #6> echo $PID > /sys/fs/cgroup/misc/a/cgroup.procs
    
    the process including the group leader back into a. In this final migration,
    non-leader threads would be doing identity migration while the group leader
    is doing an actual one.
    
    After #3, let's say the whole process was in cset A, and that after #4, the
    leader moves to cset B. Then, during #6, the following happens:
    
     1. cgroup_migrate_add_src() is called on B for the leader.
    
     2. cgroup_migrate_add_src() is called on A for the other threads.
    
     3. cgroup_migrate_prepare_dst() is called. It scans the src list.
    
     4. It notices that B wants to migrate to A, so it tries to A to the dst
        list but realizes that its ->mg_preload_node is already busy.
    
     5. and then it notices A wants to migrate to A as it's an identity
        migration, it culls it by list_del_init()'ing its ->mg_preload_node and
        putting references accordingly.
    
     6. The rest of migration takes place with B on the src list but nothing on
        the dst list.
    
    This means that A isn't held while migration is in progress. If all tasks
    leave A before the migration finishes and the incoming task pins it, the
    cset will be destroyed leading to use-after-free.
    
    This is caused by overloading cset->mg_preload_node for both src and dst
    preload lists. We wanted to exclude the cset from the src list but ended up
    inadvertently excluding it from the dst list too.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by separating out cset->mg_preload_node into
    ->mg_src_preload_node and ->mg_dst_preload_node, so that the src and dst
    preloadings don't interfere with each other.

    wifi: mac80211: fix queue selection for mesh/OCB interfaces
    
    commit 50e2ab39291947b6c6c7025cf01707c270fcde59 upstream.
    
    When using iTXQ, the code assumes that there is only one vif queue for
    broadcast packets, using the BE queue. Allowing non-BE queue marking
    violates that assumption and txq->ac == skb_queue_mapping is no longer
    guaranteed. This can cause issues with queue handling in the driver and
    also causes issues with the recent ATF change, resulting in an AQL
    underflow warning.

    ARM: 9214/1: alignment: advance IT state after emulating Thumb instruction
    
    commit e5c46fde75e43c15a29b40e5fc5641727f97ae47 upstream.
    
    After emulating a misaligned load or store issued in Thumb mode, we have
    to advance the IT state by hand, or it will get out of sync with the
    actual instruction stream, which means we'll end up applying the wrong
    condition code to subsequent instructions. This might corrupt the
    program state rather catastrophically.
    
    So borrow the it_advance() helper from the probing code, and use it on
    CPSR if the emulated instruction is Thumb.

    ip: fix dflt addr selection for connected nexthop
    
    commit 747c14307214b55dbd8250e1ab44cad8305756f1 upstream.
    
    When a nexthop is added, without a gw address, the default scope was set
    to 'host'. Thus, when a source address is selected, 127.0.0.1 may be chosen
    but rejected when the route is used.
    
    When using a route without a nexthop id, the scope can be configured in the
    route, thus the problem doesn't exist.
    
    To explain more deeply: when a user creates a nexthop, it cannot specify
    the scope. To create it, the function nh_create_ipv4() calls fib_check_nh()
    with scope set to 0. fib_check_nh() calls fib_check_nh_nongw() wich was
    setting scope to 'host'. Then, nh_create_ipv4() calls
    fib_info_update_nhc_saddr() with scope set to 'host'. The src addr is
    chosen before the route is inserted.
    
    When a 'standard' route (ie without a reference to a nexthop) is added,
    fib_create_info() calls fib_info_update_nhc_saddr() with the scope set by
    the user. iproute2 set the scope to 'link' by default.
    
    Here is a way to reproduce the problem:
    ip netns add foo
    ip -n foo link set lo up
    ip netns add bar
    ip -n bar link set lo up
    sleep 1
    
    ip -n foo link add name eth0 type dummy
    ip -n foo link set eth0 up
    ip -n foo address add 192.168.0.1/24 dev eth0
    
    ip -n foo link add name veth0 type veth peer name veth1 netns bar
    ip -n foo link set veth0 up
    ip -n bar link set veth1 up
    
    ip -n bar address add 192.168.1.1/32 dev veth1
    ip -n bar route add default dev veth1
    
    ip -n foo nexthop add id 1 dev veth0
    ip -n foo route add 192.168.1.1 nhid 1
    
    Try to get/use the route:
    > $ ip -n foo route get 192.168.1.1
    > RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument
    > $ ip netns exec foo ping -c1 192.168.1.1
    > ping: connect: Invalid argument
    
    Try without nexthop group (iproute2 sets scope to 'link' by dflt):
    ip -n foo route del 192.168.1.1
    ip -n foo route add 192.168.1.1 dev veth0
    
    Try to get/use the route:
    > $ ip -n foo route get 192.168.1.1
    > 192.168.1.1 dev veth0 src 192.168.0.1 uid 0

    net: sock: tracing: Fix sock_exceed_buf_limit not to dereference stale pointer
    
    commit 820b8963adaea34a87abbecb906d1f54c0aabfb7 upstream.
    
    The trace event sock_exceed_buf_limit saves the prot->sysctl_mem pointer
    and then dereferences it in the TP_printk() portion. This is unsafe as the
    TP_printk() portion is executed at the time the buffer is read. That is,
    it can be seconds, minutes, days, months, even years later. If the proto
    is freed, then this dereference will can also lead to a kernel crash.
    
    Instead, save the sysctl_mem array into the ring buffer and have the
    TP_printk() reference that instead. This is the proper and safe way to
    read pointers in trace events.

    tracing/histograms: Fix memory leak problem
    
    commit 7edc3945bdce9c39198a10d6129377a5c53559c2 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 46bbe5c671e06f070428b9be142cc4ee5cedebac.
    
    As commit 46bbe5c671e0 ("tracing: fix double free") said, the
    "double free" problem reported by clang static analyzer is:
      > In parse_var_defs() if there is a problem allocating
      > var_defs.expr, the earlier var_defs.name is freed.
      > This free is duplicated by free_var_defs() which frees
      > the rest of the list.
    
    However, if there is a problem allocating N-th var_defs.expr:
      + in parse_var_defs(), the freed 'earlier var_defs.name' is
        actually the N-th var_defs.name;
      + then in free_var_defs(), the names from 0th to (N-1)-th are freed;
    
                            IF ALLOCATING PROBLEM HAPPENED HERE!!! -+
                                                                     \
                                                                      |
              0th           1th                 (N-1)-th      N-th    V
              +-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+-----------
    var_defs: | name | expr | name | expr | ... | name | expr | name | ///
              +-------------+-------------+-----+-------------+-----------
    
    These two frees don't act on same name, so there was no "double free"
    problem before. Conversely, after that commit, we get a "memory leak"
    problem because the above "N-th var_defs.name" is not freed.
    
    If enable CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK and inject a fault at where the N-th
    var_defs.expr allocated, then execute on shell like:
      $ echo 'hist:key=call_site:val=$v1,$v2:v1=bytes_req,v2=bytes_alloc' > \
    /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kmem/kmalloc/trigger
    
    Then kmemleak reports:

    mm: split huge PUD on wp_huge_pud fallback
    
    commit 14c99d65941538aa33edd8dc7b1bbbb593c324a2 upstream.
    
    Currently the implementation will split the PUD when a fallback is taken
    inside the create_huge_pud function.  This isn't where it should be done:
    the splitting should be done in wp_huge_pud, just like it's done for PMDs.
    Reason being that if a callback is taken during create, there is no PUD
    yet so nothing to split, whereas if a fallback is taken when encountering
    a write protection fault there is something to split.
    
    It looks like this was the original intention with the commit where the
    splitting was introduced, but somehow it got moved to the wrong place
    between v1 and v2 of the patch series.  Rebase mistake perhaps.

    in case the loop in xenvif_rx_action() is doing multiple iterations,
    the availability of another skb in the rx queue is not being checked.
    
    This can lead to crashes:

    ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix headset mic problem for a HP machine with alc221
    
    commit 4ba5c853d7945b3855c3dcb293f7f9f019db641e upstream.
    
    On a HP 288 Pro G2 MT (X9W02AV), the front mic could not be detected.
    In order to get it working, the pin configuration needs to be set
    correctly, and the ALC221_FIXUP_HP_288PRO_MIC_NO_PRESENCE fixup needs
    to be applied.
