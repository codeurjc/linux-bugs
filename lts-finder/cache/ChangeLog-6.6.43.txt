    tap: add missing verification for short frame
    
    commit ed7f2afdd0e043a397677e597ced0830b83ba0b3 upstream.
    
    The cited commit missed to check against the validity of the frame length
    in the tap_get_user_xdp() path, which could cause a corrupted skb to be
    sent downstack. Even before the skb is transmitted, the
    tap_get_user_xdp()-->skb_set_network_header() may assume the size is more
    than ETH_HLEN. Once transmitted, this could either cause out-of-bound
    access beyond the actual length, or confuse the underlayer with incorrect
    or inconsistent header length in the skb metadata.
    
    In the alternative path, tap_get_user() already prohibits short frame which
    has the length less than Ethernet header size from being transmitted.
    
    This is to drop any frame shorter than the Ethernet header size just like
    how tap_get_user() does.

    filelock: Fix fcntl/close race recovery compat path
    
    commit f8138f2ad2f745b9a1c696a05b749eabe44337ea upstream.
    
    When I wrote commit 3cad1bc01041 ("filelock: Remove locks reliably when
    fcntl/close race is detected"), I missed that there are two copies of the
    code I was patching: The normal version, and the version for 64-bit offsets
    on 32-bit kernels.
    Thanks to Greg KH for stumbling over this while doing the stable
    backport...
    
    Apply exactly the same fix to the compat path for 32-bit kernels.

    ALSA: seq: ump: Skip useless ports for static blocks
    
    commit 3bfd7c0ba184de99e9f5083b29e5308f30767265 upstream.
    
    When the UMP Endpoint is configured with static blocks, the block
    configuration will never change, hence the unused ports will be
    unchanged as well.  Creating sequencer ports for those unused ports
    is simply useless, and it might be rather confusing for users.
    The idea behind the inactive ports was for allowing connections
    from/to ports that can become usable later, but this will never
    happen for inactive groups in static blocks.
    
    Let's change the sequencer UMP binding to skip those unused ports when
    the UMP EP is with static blocks.

    commit f77e7bd40c3c2d79685e9cc80de874b69a976f55 upstream.
    
    On the Qualcomm RB2 platform the I2C bus connected to the LT9611UXC
    bridge under some circumstances can go into a state when all transfers
    timeout. This causes both issues with fetching of EDID and with
    updating of the bridge's firmware. While we are debugging the issue,
    switch corresponding I2C bus to use i2c-gpio driver. While using
    i2c-gpio no communication issues are observed.
    
    This patch is asusmed to be a temporary fix, so it is implemented in a
    non-intrusive manner to simply reverting it later.

    usb: gadget: midi2: Fix incorrect default MIDI2 protocol setup
    
    commit 3eb27d3e32c78badbc4db6ae76614b5961e32291 upstream.
    
    The MIDI2 gadget driver handled the default MIDI protocol version
    incorrectly due to the confusion of the protocol version passed via
    configfs (either 1 or 2) and UMP protocol bits (0x100 / 0x200).
    As a consequence, the default protocol always resulted in MIDI1.
    
    This patch addresses the misunderstanding of the protocol handling.
