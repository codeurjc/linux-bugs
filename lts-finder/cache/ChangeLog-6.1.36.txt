    x86/apic: Fix kernel panic when booting with intremap=off and x2apic_phys
    
    [ Upstream commit 85d38d5810e285d5aec7fb5283107d1da70c12a9 ]
    
    When booting with "intremap=off" and "x2apic_phys" on the kernel command
    line, the physical x2APIC driver ends up being used even when x2APIC
    mode is disabled ("intremap=off" disables x2APIC mode). This happens
    because the first compound condition check in x2apic_phys_probe() is
    false due to x2apic_mode == 0 and so the following one returns true
    after default_acpi_madt_oem_check() having already selected the physical
    x2APIC driver.
    
    This results in the following panic:
    
       kernel BUG at arch/x86/kernel/apic/io_apic.c:2409!

    KVM: arm64: Restore GICv2-on-GICv3 functionality
    
    commit 1caa71a7a600f7781ce05ef1e84701c459653663 upstream.
    
    When reworking the vgic locking, the vgic distributor registration
    got simplified, which was a very good cleanup. But just a tad too
    radical, as we now register the *native* vgic only, ignoring the
    GICv2-on-GICv3 that allows pre-historic VMs (or so I thought)
    to run.
    
    As it turns out, QEMU still defaults to GICv2 in some cases, and
    this breaks Nathan's setup!
    
    Fix it by propagating the *requested* vgic type rather than the
    host's version.

    are valid:

    2. BCI of TX is set to 1

    gfs2: Don't get stuck writing page onto itself under direct I/O
    
    [ Upstream commit fa58cc888d67e640e354d8b3ceef877ea167b0cf ]
    
    When a direct I/O write is performed, iomap_dio_rw() invalidates the
    part of the page cache which the write is going to before carrying out
    the write.  In the odd case, the direct I/O write will be reading from
    the same page it is writing to.  gfs2 carries out writes with page
    faults disabled, so it should have been obvious that this page
    invalidation can cause iomap_dio_rw() to never make any progress.
    Currently, gfs2 will end up in an endless retry loop in
    gfs2_file_direct_write() instead, though.
    
    Break this endless loop by limiting the number of retries and falling
    back to buffered I/O after that.
    
    Also simplify should_fault_in_pages() sightly and add a comment to make
    the above case easier to understand.

    [ Upstream commit 20a99a291d564a559cc2fd013b4824a3bb3f1db7 ]
    
    Some devices have a wrong entry in their button array which points to
    a GPIO which is required in another driver, so soc_button_array must
    not claim it.
    
    A specific example of this is the Lenovo Yoga Book X90F / X90L,
    where the PNP0C40 home button entry points to a GPIO which is not
    a home button and which is required by the lenovo-yogabook driver.
    
    Add a DMI quirk table which can specify an ACPI GPIO resource index which
    should be skipped; and add an entry for the Lenovo Yoga Book X90F / X90L
    to this new DMI quirk table.

    nvme: improve handling of long keep alives
    
    [ Upstream commit c7275ce6a5fd32ca9f5a6294ed89cf0523181af9 ]
    
    Upon keep alive completion, nvme_keep_alive_work is scheduled with the
    same delay every time. If keep alive commands are completing slowly,
    this may cause a keep alive timeout. The following trace illustrates the
    issue, taking KATO = 8 and TBKAS off for simplicity:
    
    1. t = 0: run nvme_keep_alive_work, send keep alive
    2. t = ε: keep alive reaches controller, controller restarts its keep
              alive timer
    3. t = 4: host receives keep alive completion, schedules
              nvme_keep_alive_work with delay 4
    4. t = 8: run nvme_keep_alive_work, send keep alive
    
    Here, a keep alive having RTT of 4 causes a delay of at least 8 - ε
    between the controller receiving successive keep alives. With ε small,
    the controller is likely to detect a keep alive timeout.
    
    Fix this by calculating the RTT of the keep alive command, and adjusting
    the scheduling delay of the next keep alive work accordingly.

    nvme: check IO start time when deciding to defer KA
    
    [ Upstream commit 774a9636514764ddc0d072ae0d1d1c01a47e6ddd ]
    
    When a command completes, we set a flag which will skip sending a
    keep alive at the next run of nvme_keep_alive_work when TBKAS is on.
    However, if the command was submitted long ago, it's possible that
    the controller may have also restarted its keep alive timer (as a
    result of receiving the command) long ago. The following trace
    demonstrates the issue, assuming TBKAS is on and KATO = 8 for
    simplicity:
    
    1. t = 0: submit I/O commands A, B, C, D, E
    2. t = 0.5: commands A, B, C, D, E reach controller, restart its keep
                alive timer
    3. t = 1: A completes
    4. t = 2: run nvme_keep_alive_work, see recent completion, do nothing
    5. t = 3: B completes
    6. t = 4: run nvme_keep_alive_work, see recent completion, do nothing
    7. t = 5: C completes
    8. t = 6: run nvme_keep_alive_work, see recent completion, do nothing
    9. t = 7: D completes
    10. t = 8: run nvme_keep_alive_work, see recent completion, do nothing
    11. t = 9: E completes
    
    At this point, 8.5 seconds have passed without restarting the
    controller's keep alive timer, so the controller will detect a keep
    alive timeout.
    
    Fix this by checking the IO start time when deciding to defer sending a
    keep alive command. Only set comp_seen if the command started after the
    most recent run of nvme_keep_alive_work. With this change, the
    completions of B, C, and D will not set comp_seen and the run of
    nvme_keep_alive_work at t = 4 will send a keep alive.

    nvme: double KA polling frequency to avoid KATO with TBKAS on
    
    [ Upstream commit ea4d453b9ec9ea279c39744cd0ecb47ef48ede35 ]
    
    With TBKAS on, the completion of one command can defer sending a
    keep alive for up to twice the delay between successive runs of
    nvme_keep_alive_work. The current delay of KATO / 2 thus makes it
    possible for one command to defer sending a keep alive for up to
    KATO, which can result in the controller detecting a KATO. The following
    trace demonstrates the issue, taking KATO = 8 for simplicity:
    
    1. t = 0: run nvme_keep_alive_work, no keep-alive sent
    2. t = ε: I/O completion seen, set comp_seen = true
    3. t = 4: run nvme_keep_alive_work, see comp_seen == true,
              skip sending keep-alive, set comp_seen = false
    4. t = 8: run nvme_keep_alive_work, see comp_seen == false,
              send a keep-alive command.
    
    Here, there is a delay of 8 - ε between receiving a command completion
    and sending the next command. With ε small, the controller is likely to
    detect a keep alive timeout.
    
    Fix this by running nvme_keep_alive_work with a delay of KATO / 4
    whenever TBKAS is on. Going through the above trace now gives us a
    worst-case delay of 4 - ε, which is in line with the recommendation of
    sending a command every KATO / 2 in the NVMe specification.

    This will force the signal free time for the next transmit

    that's the initiator of the current transmit. Overwriting

    media: cec: core: disable adapter in cec_devnode_unregister
    
    [ Upstream commit fe4526d99e2e06b08bb80316c3a596ea6a807b75 ]
    
    Explicitly disable the CEC adapter in cec_devnode_unregister()
    
    Usually this does not really do anything important, but for drivers
    that use the CEC pin framework this is needed to properly stop the
    hrtimer. Without this a crash would happen when such a driver is
    unloaded with rmmod.

    smb3: missing null check in SMB2_change_notify
    
    [ Upstream commit b535cc796a4b4942cd189652588e8d37c1f5925a ]
    
    If plen is null when passed in, we only checked for null
    in one of the two places where it could be used. Although
    plen is always valid (not null) for current callers of the
    SMB2_change_notify function, this change makes it more consistent.

    scsi: target: iscsi: Prevent login threads from racing between each other
    
    [ Upstream commit 2a737d3b8c792400118d6cf94958f559de9c5e59 ]
    
    The tpg->np_login_sem is a semaphore that is used to serialize the login
    process when multiple login threads run concurrently against the same
    target portal group.
    
    The iscsi_target_locate_portal() function finds the tpg, calls
    iscsit_access_np() against the np_login_sem semaphore and saves the tpg
    pointer in conn->tpg;
    
    If iscsi_target_locate_portal() fails, the caller will check for the
    conn->tpg pointer and, if it's not NULL, then it will assume that
    iscsi_target_locate_portal() called iscsit_access_np() on the semaphore.
    
    Make sure that conn->tpg gets initialized only if iscsit_access_np() was
    successful, otherwise iscsit_deaccess_np() may end up being called against
    a semaphore we never took, allowing more than one thread to access the same
    tpg.

    gpiolib: Fix irq_domain resource tracking for gpiochip_irqchip_add_domain()
    
    [ Upstream commit ff7a1790fbf92f1bdd0966d3f0da3ea808ede876 ]
    
    Up until commit 6a45b0e2589f ("gpiolib: Introduce
    gpiochip_irqchip_add_domain()") all irq_domains were allocated
    by gpiolib itself and thus gpiolib also takes care of freeing it.
    
    With gpiochip_irqchip_add_domain() a user of gpiolib can associate an
    irq_domain with the gpio_chip. This irq_domain is not managed by
    gpiolib and therefore must not be freed by gpiolib.

    arm64: dts: rockchip: fix nEXTRST on SOQuartz
    
    [ Upstream commit cf9ae4a0077496e8224d68fc88e3df13dd7e5f37 ]
    
    In pre-production prototypes (of which I only know one person
    having one, Peter Geis), GPIO0 pin A5 was tied to the SDMMC
    power enable pin on the CM4 connector. On all production models,
    this is not the case; instead, this pin is used for the nEXTRST
    signal, and the SDMMC power enable pin is always pulled high.
    
    Since everyone currently using the SOQuartz device trees will
    want this change, it is made to the tree without splitting the
    trees into two separate ones of which users will then inevitably
    choose the wrong one.
    
    This fixes USB and PCIe on a wide variety of CM4IO-compatible
    boards which use the nEXTRST signal.

    revert "net: align SO_RCVMARK required privileges with SO_MARK"
    
    [ Upstream commit a9628e88776eb7d045cf46467f1afdd0f7fe72ea ]
    
    This reverts commit 1f86123b9749 ("net: align SO_RCVMARK required
    privileges with SO_MARK") because the reasoning in the commit message
    is not really correct:
      SO_RCVMARK is used for 'reading' incoming skb mark (via cmsg), as such
      it is more equivalent to 'getsockopt(SO_MARK)' which has no priv check
      and retrieves the socket mark, rather than 'setsockopt(SO_MARK) which
      sets the socket mark and does require privs.
    
      Additionally incoming skb->mark may already be visible if
      sysctl_fwmark_reflect and/or sysctl_tcp_fwmark_accept are enabled.
    
      Furthermore, it is easier to block the getsockopt via bpf
      (either cgroup setsockopt hook, or via syscall filters)
      then to unblock it if it requires CAP_NET_RAW/ADMIN.
    
    On Android the socket mark is (among other things) used to store
    the network identifier a socket is bound to.  Setting it is privileged,
    but retrieving it is not.  We'd like unprivileged userspace to be able
    to read the network id of incoming packets (where mark is set via
    iptables [to be moved to bpf])...
    
    An alternative would be to add another sysctl to control whether
    setting SO_RCVMARK is privilged or not.
    (or even a MASK of which bits in the mark can be exposed)
    But this seems like over-engineering...
    
    Note: This is a non-trivial revert, due to later merged commit e42c7beee71d
    ("bpf: net: Consider has_current_bpf_ctx() when testing capable() in sk_setsockopt()")
    which changed both 'ns_capable' into 'sockopt_ns_capable' calls.

    selftests: forwarding: Fix race condition in mirror installation
    
    [ Upstream commit c7c059fba6fb19c3bc924925c984772e733cb594 ]
    
    When mirroring to a gretap in hardware the device expects to be
    programmed with the egress port and all the encapsulating headers. This
    requires the driver to resolve the path the packet will take in the
    software data path and program the device accordingly.
    
    If the path cannot be resolved (in this case because of an unresolved
    neighbor), then mirror installation fails until the path is resolved.
    This results in a race that causes the test to sometimes fail.
    
    Fix this by setting the neighbor's state to permanent in a couple of
    tests, so that it is always valid.

    This will cause crash when we call helpers like get_attach_cookie or
    get_func_ip in such program, because it will call the kprobe_multi's
    version (current->bpf_ctx context setup) of those helpers while it
    expects perf_link's current->bpf_ctx context setup.

    bpf/btf: Accept function names that contain dots
    
    [ Upstream commit 9724160b3942b0a967b91a59f81da5593f28b8ba ]
    
    When building a kernel with LLVM=1, LLVM_IAS=0 and CONFIG_KASAN=y, LLVM
    leaves DWARF tags for the "asan.module_ctor" & co symbols. In turn,
    pahole creates BTF_KIND_FUNC entries for these and this makes the BTF
    metadata validation fail because they contain a dot.
    
    In a dramatic turn of event, this BTF verification failure can cause
    the netfilter_bpf initialization to fail, causing netfilter_core to
    free the netfilter_helper hashmap and netfilter_ftp to trigger a
    use-after-free. The risk of u-a-f in netfilter will be addressed
    separately but the existence of "asan.module_ctor" debug info under some
    build conditions sounds like a good enough reason to accept functions
    that contain dots in BTF.
    
    Although using only LLVM=1 is the recommended way to compile clang-based
    kernels, users can certainly do LLVM=1, LLVM_IAS=0 as well and we still
    try to support that combination according to Nick. To clarify:
    
      - > v5.10 kernel, LLVM=1 (LLVM_IAS=0 is not the default) is recommended,
        but user can still have LLVM=1, LLVM_IAS=0 to trigger the issue
    
      - <= 5.10 kernel, LLVM=1 (LLVM_IAS=0 is the default) is recommended in
        which case GNU as will be used

    netfilter: nf_tables: fix chain binding transaction logic
    
    [ Upstream commit 4bedf9eee016286c835e3d8fa981ddece5338795 ]
    
    Add bound flag to rule and chain transactions as in 6a0a8d10a366
    ("netfilter: nf_tables: use-after-free in failing rule with bound set")
    to skip them in case that the chain is already bound from the abort
    path.
    
    This patch fixes an imbalance in the chain use refcnt that triggers a
    WARN_ON on the table and chain destroy path.
    
    This patch also disallows nested chain bindings, which is not
    supported from userspace.
    
    The logic to deal with chain binding in nft_data_hold() and
    nft_data_release() is not correct. The NFT_TRANS_PREPARE state needs a
    special handling in case a chain is bound but next expressions in the
    same rule fail to initialize as described by 1240eb93f061 ("netfilter:
    nf_tables: incorrect error path handling with NFT_MSG_NEWRULE").
    
    The chain is left bound if rule construction fails, so the objects
    stored in this chain (and the chain itself) are released by the
    transaction records from the abort path, follow up patch ("netfilter:
    nf_tables: add NFT_TRANS_PREPARE_ERROR to deal with bound set/chain")
    completes this error handling.
    
    When deleting an existing rule, chain bound flag is set off so the
    rule expression .destroy path releases the objects.

    ipvs: align inner_mac_header for encapsulation
    
    [ Upstream commit d7fce52fdf96663ddc2eb21afecff3775588612a ]
    
    When using encapsulation the original packet's headers are copied to the
    inner headers. This preserves the space for an inner mac header, which
    is not used by the inner payloads for the encapsulation types supported
    by IPVS. If a packet is using GUE or GRE encapsulation and needs to be
    segmented, flow can be passed to __skb_udp_tunnel_segment() which
    calculates a negative tunnel header length. A negative tunnel header
    length causes pskb_may_pull() to fail, dropping the packet.
    
    This can be observed by attaching probes to ip_vs_in_hook(),
    __dev_queue_xmit(), and __skb_udp_tunnel_segment():
    
        perf probe --add '__dev_queue_xmit skb->inner_mac_header \
        skb->inner_network_header skb->mac_header skb->network_header'
        perf probe --add '__skb_udp_tunnel_segment:7 tnl_hlen'
        perf probe -m ip_vs --add 'ip_vs_in_hook skb->inner_mac_header \
        skb->inner_network_header skb->mac_header skb->network_header'
    
    These probes the headers and tunnel header length for packets which
    traverse the IPVS encapsulation path. A TCP packet can be forced into
    the segmentation path by being smaller than a calculated clamped MSS,
    but larger than the advertised MSS.
    
        probe:ip_vs_in_hook: inner_mac_header=0x0 inner_network_header=0x0 mac_header=0x44 network_header=0x52
        probe:ip_vs_in_hook: inner_mac_header=0x44 inner_network_header=0x52 mac_header=0x44 network_header=0x32
        probe:dev_queue_xmit: inner_mac_header=0x44 inner_network_header=0x52 mac_header=0x44 network_header=0x32
        probe:__skb_udp_tunnel_segment_L7: tnl_hlen=-2
    
    When using veth-based encapsulation, the interfaces are set to be
    mac-less, which does not preserve space for an inner mac header. This
    prevents this issue from occurring.
    
    In our real-world testing of sending a 32KB file we observed operation
    time increasing from ~75ms for veth-based encapsulation to over 1.5s
    using IPVS encapsulation due to retries from dropped packets.
    
    This changeset modifies the packet on the encapsulation path in
    ip_vs_tunnel_xmit() and ip_vs_tunnel_xmit_v6() to remove the inner mac
    header offset. This fixes UDP segmentation for both encapsulation types,
    and corrects the inner headers for any IPIP flows that may use it.

    In case the QCA7000 is not available via SPI (e.g. in reset),
    the driver will cause a high load. The reason for this is

    sfc: use budget for TX completions
    
    [ Upstream commit 4aaf2c52834b7f95acdf9fb0211a1b60adbf421b ]
    
    When running workloads heavy unbalanced towards TX (high TX, low RX
    traffic), sfc driver can retain the CPU during too long times. Although
    in many cases this is not enough to be visible, it can affect
    performance and system responsiveness.
    
    A way to reproduce it is to use a debug kernel and run some parallel
    netperf TX tests. In some systems, this will lead to this message being
    logged:
      kernel:watchdog: BUG: soft lockup - CPU#12 stuck for 22s!
    
    The reason is that sfc driver doesn't account any NAPI budget for the TX
    completion events work. With high-TX/low-RX traffic, this makes that the
    CPU is held for long time for NAPI poll.
    
    Documentations says "drivers can process completions for any number of Tx
    packets but should only process up to budget number of Rx packets".
    However, many drivers do limit the amount of TX completions that they
    process in a single NAPI poll.
    
    In the same way, this patch adds a limit for the TX work in sfc. With
    the patch applied, the watchdog warning never appears.
    
    Tested with netperf in different combinations: single process / parallel
    processes, TCP / UDP and different sizes of UDP messages. Repeated the
    tests before and after the patch, without any noticeable difference in
    network or CPU performance.
    
    Test hardware:
    Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-1620 v4 @ 3.50GHz (4 cores, 2 threads/core)

    xfrm: Linearize the skb after offloading if needed.
    
    [ Upstream commit f015b900bc3285322029b4a7d132d6aeb0e51857 ]
    
    With offloading enabled, esp_xmit() gets invoked very late, from within
    validate_xmit_xfrm() which is after validate_xmit_skb() validates and
    linearizes the skb if the underlying device does not support fragments.
    
    esp_output_tail() may add a fragment to the skb while adding the auth
    tag/ IV. Devices without the proper support will then send skb->data
    points to with the correct length so the packet will have garbage at the
    end. A pcap sniffer will claim that the proper data has been sent since
    it parses the skb properly.
    
    It is not affected with INET_ESP_OFFLOAD disabled.
    
    Linearize the skb after offloading if the sending hardware requires it.
    It was tested on v4, v6 has been adopted.

    bpf: Fix a bpf_jit_dump issue for x86_64 with sysctl bpf_jit_enable.
    
    [ Upstream commit ad96f1c9138e0897bee7f7c5e54b3e24f8b62f57 ]
    
    The sysctl net/core/bpf_jit_enable does not work now due to commit
    1022a5498f6f ("bpf, x86_64: Use bpf_jit_binary_pack_alloc"). The
    commit saved the jitted insns into 'rw_image' instead of 'image'

    With 'echo 2 > /proc/sys/net/core/bpf_jit_enable', run
    './test_progs -t fentry_test'. Without this patch, one of jitted

    [ Upstream commit 1166a530a84758bb9e6b448fc8c195ed413f5ded ]
    
    Before Linux v5.8 an AF_INET6 SOCK_DGRAM (udp/udplite) socket
    with SOL_UDP, UDP_ENCAP, UDP_ENCAP_ESPINUDP{,_NON_IKE} enabled
    would just unconditionally use xfrm4_udp_encap_rcv(), afterwards
    such a socket would use the newly added xfrm6_udp_encap_rcv()
    which only handles IPv6 packets.

    bpf: Fix verifier id tracking of scalars on spill
    
    [ Upstream commit 713274f1f2c896d37017efee333fd44149710119 ]
    
    The following scenario describes a bug in the verifier where it
    incorrectly concludes about equivalent scalar IDs which could lead to
    verifier bypass in privileged mode:
    
    1. Prepare a 32-bit rogue number.
    2. Put the rogue number into the upper half of a 64-bit register, and
       roll a random (unknown to the verifier) bit in the lower half. The
       rest of the bits should be zero (although variations are possible).
    3. Assign an ID to the register by MOVing it to another arbitrary
       register.
    4. Perform a 32-bit spill of the register, then perform a 32-bit fill to
       another register. Due to a bug in the verifier, the ID will be
       preserved, although the new register will contain only the lower 32
       bits, i.e. all zeros except one random bit.
    
    At this point there are two registers with different values but the same
    ID, which means the integrity of the verifier state has been corrupted.
    
    5. Compare the new 32-bit register with 0. In the branch where it's
       equal to 0, the verifier will believe that the original 64-bit
       register is also 0, because it has the same ID, but its actual value
       still contains the rogue number in the upper half.
       Some optimizations of the verifier prevent the actual bypass, so
       extra care is needed: the comparison must be between two registers,
       and both branches must be reachable (this is why one random bit is
       needed). Both branches are still suitable for the bypass.
    6. Right shift the original register by 32 bits to pop the rogue number.
    7. Use the rogue number as an offset with any pointer. The verifier will
       believe that the offset is 0, while in reality it's the given number.
    
    The fix is similar to the 32-bit BPF_MOV handling in check_alu_op for
    SCALAR_VALUE. If the spill is narrowing the actual register value, don't
    keep the ID, make sure it's reset to 0.

    bpf: track immediate values written to stack by BPF_ST instruction
    
    [ Upstream commit ecdf985d7615356b78241fdb159c091830ed0380 ]
    
    For aligned stack writes using BPF_ST instruction track stored values
    in a same way BPF_STX is handled, e.g. make sure that the following
    commands produce similar verifier knowledge:
    
      fp[-8] = 42;             r1 = 42;
                           fp[-8] = r1;
    
    This covers two cases:
     - non-null values written to stack are stored as spill of fake
       registers;
     - null values written to stack are stored as STACK_ZERO marks.
    
    Previously both cases above used STACK_MISC marks instead.
    
    Some verifier test cases relied on the old logic to obtain STACK_MISC
    marks for some stack values. These test cases are updated in the same
    commit to avoid failures during bisect.

    xfrm: Treat already-verified secpath entries as optional
    
    [ Upstream commit 1f8b6df6a997a430b0c48b504638154b520781ad ]
    
    This change allows inbound traffic through nested IPsec tunnels to
    successfully match policies and templates, while retaining the secpath
    stack trace as necessary for netfilter policies.
    
    Specifically, this patch marks secpath entries that have already matched
    against a relevant policy as having been verified, allowing it to be
    treated as optional and skipped after a tunnel decapsulation (during
    which the src/dst/proto/etc may have changed, and the correct policy
    chain no long be resolvable).
    
    This approach is taken as opposed to the iteration in b0355dbbf13c,
    where the secpath was cleared, since that breaks subsequent validations
    that rely on the existence of the secpath entries (netfilter policies, or
    transport-in-tunnel mode, where policies remain resolvable).

    x86/mm: Avoid using set_pgd() outside of real PGD pages
    
    commit d082d48737c75d2b3cc1f972b8c8674c25131534 upstream.
    
    KPTI keeps around two PGDs: one for userspace and another for the
    kernel. Among other things, set_pgd() contains infrastructure to
    ensure that updates to the kernel PGD are reflected in the user PGD
    as well.
    
    One side-effect of this is that set_pgd() expects to be passed whole
    pages.  Unfortunately, init_trampoline_kaslr() passes in a single entry:
    'trampoline_pgd_entry'.
    
    When KPTI is on, set_pgd() will update 'trampoline_pgd_entry' (an
    8-Byte globally stored [.bss] variable) and will then proceed to
    replicate that value into the non-existent neighboring user page
    (located +4k away), leading to the corruption of other global [.bss]
    stored variables.
    
    Fix it by directly assigning 'trampoline_pgd_entry' and avoiding
    set_pgd().

    nilfs2: prevent general protection fault in nilfs_clear_dirty_page()
    
    commit 782e53d0c14420858dbf0f8f797973c150d3b6d7 upstream.
    
    In a syzbot stress test that deliberately causes file system errors on
    nilfs2 with a corrupted disk image, it has been reported that
    nilfs_clear_dirty_page() called from nilfs_clear_dirty_pages() can cause a
    general protection fault.
    
    In nilfs_clear_dirty_pages(), when looking up dirty pages from the page
    cache and calling nilfs_clear_dirty_page() for each dirty page/folio
    retrieved, the back reference from the argument page to "mapping" may have
    been changed to NULL (and possibly others).  It is necessary to check this
    after locking the page/folio.
    
    So, fix this issue by not calling nilfs_clear_dirty_page() on a page/folio
    after locking it in nilfs_clear_dirty_pages() if the back reference
    "mapping" from the page/folio is different from the "mapping" that held
    the page/folio just before.

    io_uring/poll: serialize poll linked timer start with poll removal
    
    Commit ef7dfac51d8ed961b742218f526bd589f3900a59 upstream.
    
    We selectively grab the ctx->uring_lock for poll update/removal, but
    we really should grab it from the start to fully synchronize with
    linked timeouts. Normally this is indeed the case, but if requests

    arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix rk356x PCIe register and range mappings
    
    commit 568a67e742dfa90b19a23305317164c5c350b71e upstream.
    
    The register and range mappings for the PCIe controller in Rockchip's
    RK356x SoCs are incorrect. Replace them with corrected values from the
    vendor BSP sources, updated to match current DT schema.
    
    These values are also used in u-boot.

    regmap: spi-avmm: Fix regmap_bus max_raw_write
    
    [ Upstream commit c8e796895e2310b6130e7577248da1d771431a77 ]
    
    The max_raw_write member of the regmap_spi_avmm_bus structure is defined
    as:
            .max_raw_write = SPI_AVMM_VAL_SIZE * MAX_WRITE_CNT
    
    SPI_AVMM_VAL_SIZE == 4 and MAX_WRITE_CNT == 1 so this results in a
    maximum write transfer size of 4 bytes which provides only enough space to
    transfer the address of the target register. It provides no space for the
    value to be transferred. This bug became an issue (divide-by-zero in
    _regmap_raw_write()) after the following was accepted into mainline:
    
    commit 3981514180c9 ("regmap: Account for register length when chunking")
    
    Change max_raw_write to include space (4 additional bytes) for both the
    register address and value:
    
            .max_raw_write = SPI_AVMM_REG_SIZE + SPI_AVMM_VAL_SIZE * MAX_WRITE_CNT

    bpf: ensure main program has an extable
    
    commit 0108a4e9f3584a7a2c026d1601b0682ff7335d95 upstream.
    
    When subprograms are in use, the main program is not jit'd after the
    subprograms because jit_subprogs sets a value for prog->bpf_func upon
    success.  Subsequent calls to the JIT are bypassed when this value is
    non-NULL.  This leads to a situation where the main program and its
    func[0] counterpart are both in the bpf kallsyms tree, but only func[0]
    has an extable.  Extables are only created during JIT.  Now there are
    two nearly identical program ksym entries in the tree, but only one has
    an extable.  Depending upon how the entries are placed, there's a chance
    that a fault will call search_extable on the aux with the NULL entry.
    
    Since jit_subprogs already copies state from func[0] to the main
    program, include the extable pointer in this state duplication.
    Additionally, ensure that the copy of the main program in func[0] is not
    added to the bpf_prog_kallsyms table. Instead, let the main program get
    added later in bpf_prog_load().  This ensures there is only a single
    copy of the main program in the kallsyms table, and that its tag matches
    the tag observed by tooling like bpftool.

    mmc: sdhci-msm: Disable broken 64-bit DMA on MSM8916
    
    commit e6f9e590b72e12bbb86b1b8be7e1981f357392ad upstream.
    
    While SDHCI claims to support 64-bit DMA on MSM8916 it does not seem to
    be properly functional. It is not immediately obvious because SDHCI is
    usually used with IOMMU bypassed on this SoC, and all physical memory
    has 32-bit addresses. But when trying to enable the IOMMU it quickly
    fails with an error such as the following:
    
      arm-smmu 1e00000.iommu: Unhandled context fault:

    Looking closely it's obvious that only the 32-bit part of the address
    (0xfffff200) arrives at the SMMU, the higher 16-bit (0xffff...) get
    lost somewhere. This might not be a limitation of the SDHCI itself but
    perhaps the bus/interconnect it is connected to, or even the connection
    to the SMMU.
    
    Work around this by setting SDHCI_QUIRK2_BROKEN_64_BIT_DMA to avoid
    using 64-bit addresses.

    commit f334ad47683606b682b4166b800d8b372d315436 upstream.
    
    mmc host drivers should have enabled the asynchronous probe option, but
    it seems like we didn't set it for litex_mmc when introducing litex mmc

     ret_from_fork+0x10/0x18
    
    The race that cause this bug can be shown as below:
    
    (hotplug cpu)                | (umount cpuset)
    mutex_lock(&cpuset_mutex)    | mutex_lock(&cgroup_mutex)
    cpuset_hotplug_workfn        |
     rebuild_root_domains        |  rebind_subsystems
      update_tasks_root_domain   |   spin_lock_irq(&css_set_lock)
       css_task_iter_start       |    list_move_tail(&cset->e_cset_node[ss->id]
       while(css_task_iter_next) |                  &dcgrp->e_csets[ss->id]);
       css_task_iter_end         |   spin_unlock_irq(&css_set_lock)
    mutex_unlock(&cpuset_mutex)  | mutex_unlock(&cgroup_mutex)
    
    Inside css_task_iter_start/next/end, css_set_lock is hold and then
    released, so when iterating task(left side), the css_set may be moved to
    another list(right side), then it->cset_head points to the old list head
    and it->cset_pos->next points to the head node of new list, which can't
    be used as struct css_set.
    
    To fix this issue, switch from all css_sets to only scgrp's css_sets to
    patch in-flight iterators to preserve correct iteration, and then
    update it->cset_head as well.

    mptcp: consolidate fallback and non fallback state machine
    
    commit 81c1d029016001f994ce1c46849c5e9900d8eab8 upstream.
    
    An orphaned msk releases the used resources via the worker,
    when the latter first see the msk in CLOSED status.
    
    If the msk status transitions to TCP_CLOSE in the release callback
    invoked by the worker's final release_sock(), such instance of the
    workqueue will not take any action.
    
    Additionally the MPTCP code prevents scheduling the worker once the
    socket reaches the CLOSE status: such msk resources will be leaked.
    
    The only code path that can trigger the above scenario is the
    __mptcp_check_send_data_fin() in fallback mode.
    
    Address the issue removing the special handling of fallback socket
    in __mptcp_check_send_data_fin(), consolidating the state machine
    for fallback and non fallback socket.
    
    Since non-fallback sockets do not send and do not receive data_fin,
    the mptcp code can update the msk internal status to match the next
    step in the SM every time data fin (ack) should be generated or
    received.
    
    As a consequence we can remove a bunch of checks for fallback from
    the fastpath.

    mptcp: fix possible list corruption on passive MPJ
    
    commit 56a666c48b038e91b76471289e2cf60c79d326b9 upstream.
    
    At passive MPJ time, if the msk socket lock is held by the user,
    the new subflow is appended to the msk->join_list under the msk
    data lock.
    
    In mptcp_release_cb()/__mptcp_flush_join_list(), the subflows in
    that list are moved from the join_list into the conn_list under the
    msk socket lock.
    
    Append and removal could race, possibly corrupting such list.
    Address the issue splicing the join list into a temporary one while
    still under the msk data lock.
    
    Found by code inspection, the race itself should be almost impossible
    to trigger in practice.

    mptcp: handle correctly disconnect() failures
    
    commit c2b2ae3925b65070adb27d5a31a31c376f26dec7 upstream.
    
    Currently the mptcp code has assumes that disconnect() can fail only
    at mptcp_sendmsg_fastopen() time - to avoid a deadlock scenario - and
    don't even bother returning an error code.
    
    Soon mptcp_disconnect() will handle more error conditions: let's track
    them explicitly.
    
    As a bonus, explicitly annotate TCP-level disconnect as not failing:
    the mptcp code never blocks for event on the subflows.

    io_uring/net: disable partial retries for recvmsg with cmsg
    
    commit 78d0d2063bab954d19a1696feae4c7706a626d48 upstream.
    
    We cannot sanely handle partial retries for recvmsg if we have cmsg
    attached. If we don't, then we'd just be overwriting the initial cmsg
    header on retries. Alternatively we could increment and handle this
    appropriately, but it doesn't seem worth the complication.
    
    Move the MSG_WAITALL check into the non-multishot case while at it,

    PCI: hv: Add a per-bus mutex state_lock
    
    commit 067d6ec7ed5b49380688e06c1e5f883a71bef4fe upstream.
    
    In the case of fast device addition/removal, it's possible that
    hv_eject_device_work() can start to run before create_root_hv_pci_bus()
    starts to run; as a result, the pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot() in
    hv_eject_device_work() can return a 'pdev' of NULL, and
    hv_eject_device_work() can remove the 'hpdev', and immediately send a
    message PCI_EJECTION_COMPLETE to the host, and the host immediately
    unassigns the PCI device from the guest; meanwhile,
    create_root_hv_pci_bus() and the PCI device driver can be probing the
    dead PCI device and reporting timeout errors.
    
    Fix the issue by adding a per-bus mutex 'state_lock' and grabbing the
    mutex before powering on the PCI bus in hv_pci_enter_d0(): when
    hv_eject_device_work() starts to run, it's able to find the 'pdev' and call
    pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device(pdev): if the PCI device driver has
    loaded, the PCI device driver's probe() function is already called in
    create_root_hv_pci_bus() -> pci_bus_add_devices(), and now
    hv_eject_device_work() -> pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device() is able
    to call the PCI device driver's remove() function and remove the device
    reliably; if the PCI device driver hasn't loaded yet, the function call
    hv_eject_device_work() -> pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device() is able to
    remove the PCI device reliably and the PCI device driver's probe()
    function won't be called; if the PCI device driver's probe() is already
    running (e.g., systemd-udev is loading the PCI device driver), it must
    be holding the per-device lock, and after the probe() finishes and releases
    the lock, hv_eject_device_work() -> pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device() is
    able to proceed to remove the device reliably.

    PCI: hv: Fix a race condition in hv_irq_unmask() that can cause panic
    
    commit 2738d5ab7929a845b654cd171a1e275c37eb428e upstream.
    
    When the host tries to remove a PCI device, the host first sends a
    PCI_EJECT message to the guest, and the guest is supposed to gracefully
    remove the PCI device and send a PCI_EJECTION_COMPLETE message to the host;
    the host then sends a VMBus message CHANNELMSG_RESCIND_CHANNELOFFER to
    the guest (when the guest receives this message, the device is already
    unassigned from the guest) and the guest can do some final cleanup work;
    if the guest fails to respond to the PCI_EJECT message within one minute,
    the host sends the VMBus message CHANNELMSG_RESCIND_CHANNELOFFER and
    removes the PCI device forcibly.
    
    In the case of fast device addition/removal, it's possible that the PCI
    device driver is still configuring MSI-X interrupts when the guest receives
    the PCI_EJECT message; the channel callback calls hv_pci_eject_device(),
    which sets hpdev->state to hv_pcichild_ejecting, and schedules a work
    hv_eject_device_work(); if the PCI device driver is calling
    pci_alloc_irq_vectors() -> ... -> hv_compose_msi_msg(), we can break the
    while loop in hv_compose_msi_msg() due to the updated hpdev->state, and
    leave data->chip_data with its default value of NULL; later, when the PCI
    device driver calls request_irq() -> ... -> hv_irq_unmask(), the guest
    crashes in hv_arch_irq_unmask() due to data->chip_data being NULL.
    
    Fix the issue by not testing hpdev->state in the while loop: when the
    guest receives PCI_EJECT, the device is still assigned to the guest, and
    the guest has one minute to finish the device removal gracefully. We don't
    really need to (and we should not) test hpdev->state in the loop.

    commit a847234e24d03d01a9566d1d9dcce018cc018d67 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit d6af2ed29c7c1c311b96dac989dcb991e90ee195.
    
    The statement "the hv_pci_bus_exit() call releases structures of all its
    child devices" in commit d6af2ed29c7c is not true: in the path
    hv_pci_probe() -> hv_pci_enter_d0() -> hv_pci_bus_exit(hdev, true): the
    parameter "keep_devs" is true, so hv_pci_bus_exit() does *not* release the
    child "struct hv_pci_dev *hpdev" that is created earlier in
    pci_devices_present_work() -> new_pcichild_device().
    
    The commit d6af2ed29c7c was originally made in July 2020 for RHEL 7.7,
    where the old version of hv_pci_bus_exit() was used; when the commit was
    rebased and merged into the upstream, people didn't notice that it's
    not really necessary. The commit itself doesn't cause any issue, but it
    makes hv_pci_probe() more complicated. Revert it to facilitate some
    upcoming changes to hv_pci_probe().

    Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix vmbus_wait_for_unload() to scan present CPUs
    
    commit 320805ab61e5f1e2a5729ae266e16bec2904050c upstream.
    
    vmbus_wait_for_unload() may be called in the panic path after other
    CPUs are stopped. vmbus_wait_for_unload() currently loops through
    online CPUs looking for the UNLOAD response message. But the values of
    CONFIG_KEXEC_CORE and crash_kexec_post_notifiers affect the path used
    to stop the other CPUs, and in one of the paths the stopped CPUs
    are removed from cpu_online_mask. This removal happens in both
    x86/x64 and arm64 architectures. In such a case, vmbus_wait_for_unload()
    only checks the panic'ing CPU, and misses the UNLOAD response message
    except when the panic'ing CPU is CPU 0. vmbus_wait_for_unload()
    eventually times out, but only after waiting 100 seconds.
    
    Fix this by looping through *present* CPUs in vmbus_wait_for_unload().
    The cpu_present_mask is not modified by stopping the other CPUs in the
    panic path, nor should it be.
    
    Also, in a CoCo VM the synic_message_page is not allocated in
    hv_synic_alloc(), but is set and cleared in hv_synic_enable_regs()
    and hv_synic_disable_regs() such that it is set only when the CPU is
    online.  If not all present CPUs are online when vmbus_wait_for_unload()
    is called, the synic_message_page might be NULL. Add a check for this.

    KVM: Avoid illegal stage2 mapping on invalid memory slot
    
    commit 2230f9e1171a2e9731422a14d1bbc313c0b719d1 upstream.
    
    We run into guest hang in edk2 firmware when KSM is kept as running on
    the host. The edk2 firmware is waiting for status 0x80 from QEMU's pflash
    device (TYPE_PFLASH_CFI01) during the operation of sector erasing or
    buffered write. The status is returned by reading the memory region of
    the pflash device and the read request should have been forwarded to QEMU
    and emulated by it. Unfortunately, the read request is covered by an
    illegal stage2 mapping when the guest hang issue occurs. The read request
    is completed with QEMU bypassed and wrong status is fetched. The edk2
    firmware runs into an infinite loop with the wrong status.
    
    The illegal stage2 mapping is populated due to same page sharing by KSM
    at (C) even the associated memory slot has been marked as invalid at (B)
    when the memory slot is requested to be deleted. It's notable that the
    active and inactive memory slots can't be swapped when we're in the middle
    of kvm_mmu_notifier_change_pte() because kvm->mn_active_invalidate_count
    is elevated, and kvm_swap_active_memslots() will busy loop until it reaches
    to zero again. Besides, the swapping from the active to the inactive memory
    slots is also avoided by holding &kvm->srcu in __kvm_handle_hva_range(),
    corresponding to synchronize_srcu_expedited() in kvm_swap_active_memslots().

      kvm_mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_end
    
    Fix the issue by skipping the invalid memory slot at (C) to avoid the
    illegal stage2 mapping so that the read request for the pflash's status
    is forwarded to QEMU and emulated by it. In this way, the correct pflash's
    status can be returned from QEMU to break the infinite loop in the edk2
    firmware.
    
    We tried a git-bisect and the first problematic commit is cd4c71835228 ("
    KVM: arm64: Convert to the gfn-based MMU notifier callbacks"). With this,
    clean_dcache_guest_page() is called after the memory slots are iterated
    in kvm_mmu_notifier_change_pte(). clean_dcache_guest_page() is called
    before the iteration on the memory slots before this commit. This change
    literally enlarges the racy window between kvm_mmu_notifier_change_pte()
    and memory slot removal so that we're able to reproduce the issue in a
    practical test case. However, the issue exists since commit d5d8184d35c9
    ("KVM: ARM: Memory virtualization setup").

    ACPI: sleep: Avoid breaking S3 wakeup due to might_sleep()
    
    commit 22db06337f590d01d79f60f181d8dfe5a9ef9085 upstream.
    
    The addition of might_sleep() to down_timeout() caused the latter to
    enable interrupts unconditionally in some cases, which in turn broke
    the ACPI S3 wakeup path in acpi_suspend_enter(), where down_timeout()
    is called by acpi_disable_all_gpes() via acpi_ut_acquire_mutex().
    
    Namely, if CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP is set, might_sleep() causes
    might_resched() to be used and if CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY is set,
    this triggers __cond_resched() which may call preempt_schedule_common(),
    so __schedule() gets invoked and it ends up with enabled interrupts (in
    the prev == next case).
    
    Now, enabling interrupts early in the S3 wakeup path causes the kernel
    to crash.
    
    Address this by modifying acpi_suspend_enter() to disable GPEs without
    attempting to acquire the sleeping lock which is not needed in that code
    path anyway.

    nilfs2: fix buffer corruption due to concurrent device reads
    
    commit 679bd7ebdd315bf457a4740b306ae99f1d0a403d upstream.
    
    As a result of analysis of a syzbot report, it turned out that in three
    cases where nilfs2 allocates block device buffers directly via sb_getblk,
    concurrent reads to the device can corrupt the allocated buffers.
    
    Nilfs2 uses sb_getblk for segment summary blocks, that make up a log
    header, and the super root block, that is the trailer, and when moving and
    writing the second super block after fs resize.
    
    In any of these, since the uptodate flag is not set when storing metadata
    to be written in the allocated buffers, the stored metadata will be
    overwritten if a device read of the same block occurs concurrently before
    the write.  This causes metadata corruption and misbehavior in the log
    write itself, causing warnings in nilfs_btree_assign() as reported.
    
    Fix these issues by setting an uptodate flag on the buffer head on the
    first or before modifying each buffer obtained with sb_getblk, and
    clearing the flag on failure.
    
    When setting the uptodate flag, the lock_buffer/unlock_buffer pair is used
    to perform necessary exclusive control, and the buffer is filled to ensure
    that uninitialized bytes are not mixed into the data read from others.  As
    for buffers for segment summary blocks, they are filled incrementally, so
    if the uptodate flag was unset on their allocation, set the flag and zero
    fill the buffer once at that point.
    
    Also, regarding the superblock move routine, the starting point of the
    memset call to zerofill the block is incorrectly specified, which can
    cause a buffer overflow on file systems with block sizes greater than
    4KiB.  In addition, if the superblock is moved within a large block, it is
    necessary to assume the possibility that the data in the superblock will
    be destroyed by zero-filling before copying.  So fix these potential
    issues as well.

    writeback: fix dereferencing NULL mapping->host on writeback_page_template
    
    commit 54abe19e00cfcc5a72773d15cd00ed19ab763439 upstream.
    
    When commit 19343b5bdd16 ("mm/page-writeback: introduce tracepoint for
    wait_on_page_writeback()") repurposed the writeback_dirty_page trace event
    as a template to create its new wait_on_page_writeback trace event, it
    ended up opening a window to NULL pointer dereference crashes due to the
    (infrequent) occurrence of a race where an access to a page in the
    swap-cache happens concurrently with the moment this page is being written
    to disk and the tracepoint is enabled:
    
        BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000040

    This problem arises from the fact that the repurposed writeback_dirty_page
    trace event code was written assuming that every pointer to mapping
    (struct address_space) would come from a file-mapped page-cache object,
    thus mapping->host would always be populated, and that was a valid case
    before commit 19343b5bdd16.  The swap-cache address space
    (swapper_spaces), however, doesn't populate its ->host (struct inode)
    pointer, thus leading to the crashes in the corner-case aforementioned.
    
    commit 19343b5bdd16 ended up breaking the assignment of __entry->name and
    __entry->ino for the wait_on_page_writeback tracepoint -- both dependent
    on mapping->host carrying a pointer to a valid inode.  The assignment of
    __entry->name was fixed by commit 68f23b89067f ("memcg: fix a crash in
    wb_workfn when a device disappears"), and this commit fixes the remaining
    case, for __entry->ino.

    selftests: mptcp: join: fix "userspace pm add & remove address"
    
    It looks like this test was broken in v6.1 after the backport of commit
    48d73f609dcc ("selftests: mptcp: update userspace pm addr tests").
    
    It was not working because the commit ad3493746ebe ("selftests: mptcp:
    add test-cases for mixed v4/v6 subflows") is not in v6.1. This commit
    changes how the connections are being created in mptcp_join.sh selftest:
    with IPv6 support always enabled. But then in v6.1, the server still
    create IPv4 only connections, so without the v4-mapped-v6 format with
    the "::ffff:" prefix like we have in v6.3.
    
    The modification here adds a support for connections created in v4 as
    well so it fixes the issue in v6.1. This patch is not needed for the
    selftests in v6.3 because only IPv6 listening sockets are being created.

    selftests: mptcp: join: skip test if iptables/tc cmds fail
    
    commit 4a0b866a3f7d3c22033f40e93e94befc6fe51bce upstream
    
    Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
    supporting all MPTCP features.
    
    Some tests are using IPTables and/or TC commands to force some
    behaviours. If one of these commands fails -- likely because some
    features are not available due to missing kernel config -- we should
    intercept the error and skip the tests requiring these features.
    
    Note that if we expect to have these features available and if
    SELFTESTS_MPTCP_LIB_EXPECT_ALL_FEATURES env var is set to 1, the tests
    will be marked as failed instead of skipped.
    
    This patch also replaces the 'exit 1' by 'return 1' not to stop the
    selftest in the middle without the conclusion if there is an issue with
    NF or TC.

    selftests: mptcp: diag: skip listen tests if not supported
    
    commit dc97251bf0b70549c76ba261516c01b8096771c5 upstream.
    
    Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not

    One of them is the listen diag dump support introduced by
    commit 4fa39b701ce9 ("mptcp: listen diag dump support").
    
    It looks like there is no good pre-check to do here, i.e. dedicated
    function available in kallsyms. Instead, we try to get info if nothing
    is returned, the test is marked as skipped.
    
    That's not ideal because something could be wrong with the feature and
    instead of reporting an error, the test could be marked as skipped. If
    we know in advanced that the feature is supposed to be supported, the
    tester can set SELFTESTS_MPTCP_LIB_EXPECT_ALL_FEATURES env var to 1: in
    this case the test will report an error instead of marking the test as
    skipped if nothing is returned.

    Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
    supporting all MPTCP features.
    
    One of them is the support of the fullmesh flag for the in-kernel PM
    introduced by commit 2843ff6f36db ("mptcp: remote addresses fullmesh")
    and commit 1a0d6136c5f0 ("mptcp: local addresses fullmesh").
    
    It looks like there is no easy external sign we can use to predict the
    expected behaviour. We could add the flag and then check if it has been
    added but for that, and for each fullmesh test, we would need to setup a
    new environment, do the checks, clean it and then only start the test
    from yet another clean environment. To keep it simple and avoid
    introducing new issues, we look for a specific kernel version. That's
    not ideal but an acceptable solution for this case.

    selftests: mptcp: join: skip backup if set flag on ID not supported
    
    commit 07216a3c5d926bf1b6b360a0073747228a1f9b7f upstream.
    
    Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
    supporting all MPTCP features.
    
    Commit bccefb762439 ("selftests: mptcp: simplify pm_nl_change_endpoint")
    has simplified the way the backup flag is set on an endpoint. Instead of
    doing:
    
      ./pm_nl_ctl set 10.0.2.1 flags backup
    
    Now we do:
    
      ./pm_nl_ctl set id 1 flags backup
    
    The new way is easier to maintain but it is also incompatible with older
    kernels not supporting the implicit endpoints putting in place the
    infrastructure to set flags per ID, hence the second Fixes tag.

    selftests: mptcp: join: skip implicit tests if not supported
    
    commit 36c4127ae8dd0ebac6d56d8a1b272dd483471c40 upstream.
    
    Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
    supporting all MPTCP features.
    
    One of them is the support of the implicit endpoints introduced by
    commit d045b9eb95a9 ("mptcp: introduce implicit endpoints").
    
    It is possible to look for "mptcp_subflow_send_ack" in kallsyms because
    it was needed to introduce the mentioned feature. So we can know in
    advance if the feature is supported instead of trying and accepting any
    results.
    
    Note that here and in the following commits, we re-do the same check for
    each sub-test of the same function for a few reasons. The main one is
    not to break the ID assign to each test in order to be able to easily
    compare results between different kernel versions. Also, we can still
    run a specific test even if it is skipped. Another reason is that it
    makes it clear during the review that a specific subtest will be skipped
    or not under certain conditions. At the end, it looks OK to call the
    exact same helper multiple times: it is not a critical path and it is
    the same code that is executed, not really more cases to maintain.

    commit 425ba803124b90cb9124d99f13b372a89dc151d9 upstream.
    
    Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
    supporting all MPTCP features.
    
    At some points, a new feature caused internal behaviour changes we are
    verifying in the selftests, see the Fixes tag below. It was not a UAPI
    change but because in these selftests, we check some internal
    behaviours, it is normal we have to adapt them from time to time after
    having added some features.
    
    It looks like there is no external sign we can use to predict the
    expected behaviour. Instead of accepting different behaviours and thus
    not really checking for the expected behaviour, we are looking here for
    a specific kernel version. That's not ideal but it looks better than
    removing the test because it cannot support older kernel versions.

    selftests: mptcp: join: skip check if MIB counter not supported
    
    commit 47867f0a7e831e24e5eab3330667ce9682d50fb1 upstream.
    
    Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
    supporting all MPTCP features.
    
    One of them is the MPTCP MIB counters introduced in commit fc518953bc9c
    ("mptcp: add and use MIB counter infrastructure") and more later. The
    MPTCP Join selftest heavily relies on these counters.
    
    If a counter is not supported by the kernel, it is not displayed when
    using 'nstat -z'. We can then detect that and skip the verification. A
    new helper (get_counter()) has been added to do the required checks and
    return an error if the counter is not available.
    
    Note that if we expect to have these features available and if
    SELFTESTS_MPTCP_LIB_EXPECT_ALL_FEATURES env var is set to 1, the tests
    will be marked as failed instead of skipped.
    
    This new helper also makes sure we get the exact counter we want to
    avoid issues we had in the past, e.g. with MPTcpExtRmAddr and
    MPTcpExtRmAddrDrop sharing the same prefix. While at it, we uniform the
    way we fetch a MIB counter.
    
    Note for the backports: we rarely change these modified blocks so if
    there is are conflicts, it is very likely because a counter is not used
    in the older kernels and we don't need that chunk.

    selftests: mptcp: lib: skip if not below kernel version
    
    commit b1a6a38ab8a633546cefae890da842f19e006c74 upstream.
    
    Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
    supporting all MPTCP features.
    
    A new function is now available to easily detect if a feature is
    missing by looking at the kernel version. That's clearly not ideal and
    this kind of check should be avoided as soon as possible. But sometimes,
    there are no external sign that a "feature" is available or not:
    internal behaviours can change without modifying the uAPI and these
    selftests are verifying the internal behaviours. Sometimes, the only
    (easy) way to verify if the feature is present is to run the test but
    then the validation cannot determine if there is a failure with the
    feature or if the feature is missing. Then it looks better to check the
    kernel version instead of having tests that can never fail. In any case,
    we need a solution not to have a whole selftest being marked as failed
    just because one sub-test has failed.
    
    Note that this env var car be set to 1 not to do such check and run the
    linked sub-test: SELFTESTS_MPTCP_LIB_NO_KVERSION_CHECK.
    
    This new helper is going to be used in the following commits. In order
    to ease the backport of such future patches, it would be good if this
    patch is backported up to the introduction of MPTCP selftests, hence the
    Fixes tag below: this type of check was supposed to be done from the
    beginning.

    selftests: mptcp: sockopt: relax expected returned size
    
    commit 8dee6ca2ac1e5630a7bb6a98bc0b686916fc2000 upstream.
    
    Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
    supporting all MPTCP features.
    
    One of them is the getsockopt(SOL_MPTCP) to get info about the MPTCP
    connections introduced by commit 55c42fa7fa33 ("mptcp: add MPTCP_INFO
    getsockopt") and the following ones.
    
    We cannot guess in advance which sizes the kernel will returned: older
    kernel can returned smaller sizes, e.g. recently the tcp_info structure
    has been modified in commit 71fc704768f6 ("tcp: add rcv_wnd and
    plb_rehash to TCP_INFO") where a new field has been added.
    
    The userspace can also expect a smaller size if it is compiled with old
    uAPI kernel headers.
    
    So for these sizes, we can only check if they are above a certain
    threshold, 0 for the moment. We can also only compared sizes with the
    ones set by the kernel.

    selftests: mptcp: pm nl: remove hardcoded default limits
    
    commit 2177d0b08e421971e035672b70f3228d9485c650 upstream.
    
    Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
    supporting all MPTCP features.
    
    One of them is the checks of the default limits returned by the MPTCP
    in-kernel path-manager. The default values have been modified by commit
    72bcbc46a5c3 ("mptcp: increase default max additional subflows to 2").
    Instead of comparing with hardcoded values, we can get the default one
    and compare with them.
    
    Note that if we expect to have the latest version, we continue to check
    the hardcoded values to avoid unexpected behaviour changes.

    commit 4ad39a42da2e9770c8e4c37fe632ed8898419129 upstream.
    
    Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
    supporting all MPTCP features.
    
    One of them is the full support of disconnections from the userspace
    introduced by commit b29fcfb54cd7 ("mptcp: full disconnect
    implementation").
    
    It is possible to look for "mptcp_pm_data_reset" in kallsyms because a
    preparation patch added it to ease the introduction of the mentioned
    feature.

    commit 07bf49401909264a38fa3427c3cce43e8304436a upstream.
    
    Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
    supporting all MPTCP features.
    
    One of them is the support of IP(V6)_TRANSPARENT socket option with
    MPTCP connections introduced by commit c9406a23c116 ("mptcp: sockopt:
    add SOL_IP freebind & transparent options").
    
    It is possible to look for "__ip_sock_set_tos" in kallsyms because
    IP(V6)_TRANSPARENT socket option support has been added after TOS
    support which came with the required infrastructure in MPTCP sockopt
    code. To support TOS, the following function has been exported (T). Not
    great but better than checking for a specific kernel version.

    Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not

    New functions are now available to easily detect if a certain feature is
    missing by looking at kallsyms.
    
    These new helpers are going to be used in the following commits. In
    order to ease the backport of such future patches, it would be good if
    this patch is backported up to the introduction of MPTCP selftests,
    hence the Fixes tag below: this type of check was supposed to be done
    from the beginning.

    selftests: mptcp: join: fix ShellCheck warnings
    
    commit 0fcd72df8847d3a62eb34a084862157ce0564a94 upstream.
    
    Most of the code had an issue according to ShellCheck.
    
    That's mainly due to the fact it incorrectly believes most of the code
    was unreachable because it's invoked by variable name, see how the
    "tests" array is used.
    
    Once SC2317 has been ignored, three small warnings were still visible:
    
     - SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values.
    
     - SC2046: Quote this to prevent word splitting: can be ignored because
       "ip netns pids" can display more than one pid.
    
     - SC2166: Prefer [ p ] || [ q ] as [ p -o q ] is not well defined.
    
    This probably didn't fix any actual issues but it might help spotting
    new interesting warnings reported by ShellCheck as just before,
    ShellCheck was reporting issues for most lines making it a bit useless.

    selftests: mptcp: remove duplicated entries in usage
    
    commit 0a85264e48b642d360720589fdb837a3643fb9b0 upstream.
    
    mptcp_connect tool was printing some duplicated entries when showing how
    to use it: -j -l -r
    
    While at it, I also:
    
     - moved the very few entries that were not sorted,
    
     - added -R that was missing since
       commit 8a4b910d005d ("mptcp: selftests: add rcvbuf set option"),
    
     - removed the -u parameter that has been removed in
       commit f730b65c9d85 ("selftests: mptcp: try to set mptcp ulp mode in different sk states").
    
    No need to backport this, it is just an internal tool used by our
    selftests. The help menu is mainly useful for MPTCP kernel devs.

    tick/common: Align tick period during sched_timer setup
    
    commit 13bb06f8dd42071cb9a49f6e21099eea05d4b856 upstream.
    
    The tick period is aligned very early while the first clock_event_device is
    registered. At that point the system runs in periodic mode and switches
    later to one-shot mode if possible.
    
    The next wake-up event is programmed based on the aligned value
    (tick_next_period) but the delta value, that is used to program the
    clock_event_device, is computed based on ktime_get().
    
    With the subtracted offset, the device fires earlier than the exact time
    frame. With a large enough offset the system programs the timer for the
    next wake-up and the remaining time left is too small to make any boot
    progress. The system hangs.
    
    Move the alignment later to the setup of tick_sched timer. At this point
    the system switches to oneshot mode and a high resolution clocksource is
    available. At this point it is safe to align tick_next_period because
    ktime_get() will now return accurate (not jiffies based) time.

    tpm_crb: Add support for CRB devices based on Pluton
    
    commit 4d2732882703791ea4b670df433f88fc4b40a5cb upstream.
    
    Pluton is an integrated security processor present in some recent Ryzen
    parts. If it's enabled, it presents two devices - an MSFT0101 ACPI device
    that's broadly an implementation of a Command Response Buffer TPM2, and an
    MSFT0200 ACPI device whose functionality I haven't examined in detail yet.
    This patch only attempts to add support for the TPM device.
    
    There's a few things that need to be handled here. The first is that the
    TPM2 ACPI table uses a previously undefined start method identifier. The
    table format appears to include 16 bytes of startup data, which corresponds
    to one 64-bit address for a start message and one 64-bit address for a
    completion response. The second is that the ACPI tables on the Thinkpad Z13
    I'm testing this on don't define any memory windows in _CRS (or, more
    accurately, there are two empty memory windows). This check doesn't seem
    strictly necessary, so I've skipped that.
    
    Finally, it seems like chip needs to be explicitly asked to transition into
    ready status on every command. Failing to do this means that if two
    commands are sent in succession without an idle/ready transition in
    between, everything will appear to work fine but the response is simply the
    original command. I'm working without any docs here, so I'm not sure if
    this is actually the required behaviour or if I'm missing something
    somewhere else, but doing this results in the chip working reliably.

    mm: Fix copy_from_user_nofault().
    
    commit d319f344561de23e810515d109c7278919bff7b0 upstream.
    
    There are several issues with copy_from_user_nofault():
    
    - access_ok() is designed for user context only and for that reason
    it has WARN_ON_IN_IRQ() which triggers when bpf, kprobe, eprobe
    and perf on ppc are calling it from irq.
    
    - it's missing nmi_uaccess_okay() which is a nop on all architectures
    except x86 where it's required.
    The comment in arch/x86/mm/tlb.c explains the details why it's necessary.
    Calling copy_from_user_nofault() from bpf, [ke]probe without this check is not safe.
    
    - __copy_from_user_inatomic() under CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY is calling
    check_object_size()->__check_object_size()->check_heap_object()->find_vmap_area()->spin_lock()
    which is not safe to do from bpf, [ke]probe and perf due to potential deadlock.
    
    Fix all three issues. At the end the copy_from_user_nofault() becomes
    equivalent to copy_from_user_nmi() from safety point of view with
    a difference in the return value.

    ata: libata-scsi: Avoid deadlock on rescan after device resume
    
    [ Upstream commit 6aa0365a3c8512587fffd42fe438768709ddef8e ]
    
    When an ATA port is resumed from sleep, the port is reset and a power
    management request issued to libata EH to reset the port and rescanning
    the device(s) attached to the port. Device rescanning is done by
    scheduling an ata_scsi_dev_rescan() work, which will execute
    scsi_rescan_device().
    
    However, scsi_rescan_device() takes the generic device lock, which is
    also taken by dpm_resume() when the SCSI device is resumed as well. If
    a device rescan execution starts before the completion of the SCSI
    device resume, the rcu locking used to refresh the cached VPD pages of
    the device, combined with the generic device locking from
    scsi_rescan_device() and from dpm_resume() can cause a deadlock.
    
    Avoid this situation by changing struct ata_port scsi_rescan_task to be
    a delayed work instead of a simple work_struct. ata_scsi_dev_rescan() is
    modified to check if the SCSI device associated with the ATA device that
    must be rescanned is not suspended. If the SCSI device is still
    suspended, ata_scsi_dev_rescan() returns early and reschedule itself for
    execution after an arbitrary delay of 5ms.

    tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: reduce RX watermark to 0 on LS1028A
    
    [ Upstream commit a82c3df955f8c1c726e4976527aa6ae924a67dd9 ]
    
    LS1028A is using DMA with LPUART. Having RX watermark set to 1, means
    DMA transactions are started only after receiving the second character.
    
    On other platforms with newer LPUART IP, Receiver Idle Empty function
    initiates the DMA request after the receiver is idling for 4 characters.
    But this feature is missing on LS1028A, which is causing a 1-character
    delay in the RX direction on this platform.
    
    Set RX watermark to 0 to initiate RX DMA after each character.

    drm/amd/display: fix the system hang while disable PSR
    
    [ Upstream commit ea2062dd1f0384ae1b136d333ee4ced15bedae38 ]
    
    [Why]
    When the PSR enabled. If you try to adjust the timing parameters,
    it may cause system hang. Because the timing mismatch with the
    DMCUB settings.
    
    [How]
    Disable the PSR before adjusting timing parameters.

    drm/amd/display: Add wrapper to call planes and stream update
    
    [ Upstream commit 81f743a08f3b214638aa389e252ae5e6c3592e7c ]
    
    [Why & How]
    This commit is part of a sequence of changes that replaces the commit
    sequence used in the DC with a new one. As a result of this transition,
    we moved some specific parts from the commit sequence and brought them
    to amdgpu_dm. This commit adds a wrapper inside DM that enable our
    drivers to do any necessary preparation or change before we offload the
    plane/stream update to DC.

    drm/amd/display: Use dc_update_planes_and_stream
    
    [ Upstream commit f7511289821ffccc07579406d6ab520aa11049f5 ]
    
    [Why & How]
    The old dc_commit_updates_for_stream lacks manipulation for many corner
    cases where the DC feature requires special attention; as a result, it
    starts to show its limitation (e.g., the SubVP feature is not supported
    by it, among other cases). To modernize and unify our internal API, this
    commit replaces the old dc_commit_updates_for_stream with
    dc_update_planes_and_stream, which has more features.
