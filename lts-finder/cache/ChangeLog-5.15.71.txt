    ext4: use locality group preallocation for small closed files
    
    commit a9f2a2931d0e197ab28c6007966053fdababd53f upstream.
    
    Curently we don't use any preallocation when a file is already closed
    when allocating blocks (from writeback code when converting delayed
    allocation). However for small files, using locality group preallocation
    is actually desirable as that is not specific to a particular file.
    Rather it is a method to pack small files together to reduce
    fragmentation and for that the fact the file is closed is actually even
    stronger hint the file would benefit from packing. So change the logic
    to allow locality group preallocation in this case.

    ext4: avoid unnecessary spreading of allocations among groups
    
    commit 1940265ede6683f6317cba0d428ce6505eaca944 upstream.
    
    mb_set_largest_free_order() updates lists containing groups with largest
    chunk of free space of given order. The way it updates it leads to
    always moving the group to the tail of the list. Thus allocations
    looking for free space of given order effectively end up cycling through
    all groups (and due to initialization in last to first order). This
    spreads allocations among block groups which reduces performance for
    rotating disks or low-end flash media. Change
    mb_set_largest_free_order() to only update lists if the order of the
    largest free chunk in the group changed.

    ext4: make mballoc try target group first even with mb_optimize_scan
    
    commit 4fca50d440cc5d4dc570ad5484cc0b70b381bc2a upstream.
    
    One of the side-effects of mb_optimize_scan was that the optimized
    functions to select next group to try were called even before we tried
    the goal group. As a result we no longer allocate files close to
    corresponding inodes as well as we don't try to expand currently
    allocated extent in the same group. This results in reaim regression
    with workfile.disk workload of upto 8% with many clients on my test
    machine:
    
                         baseline               mb_optimize_scan
    Hmean     disk-1       2114.16 (   0.00%)     2099.37 (  -0.70%)
    Hmean     disk-41     87794.43 (   0.00%)    83787.47 *  -4.56%*
    Hmean     disk-81    148170.73 (   0.00%)   135527.05 *  -8.53%*
    Hmean     disk-121   177506.11 (   0.00%)   166284.93 *  -6.32%*
    Hmean     disk-161   220951.51 (   0.00%)   207563.39 *  -6.06%*
    Hmean     disk-201   208722.74 (   0.00%)   203235.59 (  -2.63%)
    Hmean     disk-241   222051.60 (   0.00%)   217705.51 (  -1.96%)
    Hmean     disk-281   252244.17 (   0.00%)   241132.72 *  -4.41%*
    Hmean     disk-321   255844.84 (   0.00%)   245412.84 *  -4.08%*
    
    Also this is causing huge regression (time increased by a factor of 5 or
    so) when untarring archive with lots of small files on some eMMC storage
    cards.
    
    Fix the problem by making sure we try goal group first.

    ext4: limit the number of retries after discarding preallocations blocks
    
    commit 80fa46d6b9e7b1527bfd2197d75431fd9c382161 upstream.
    
    This patch avoids threads live-locking for hours when a large number
    threads are competing over the last few free extents as they blocks
    getting added and removed from preallocation pools.  From our bug
    reporter:
    
       A reliable way for triggering this has multiple writers
       continuously write() to files when the filesystem is full, while
       small amounts of space are freed (e.g. by truncating a large file
       -1MiB at a time). In the local filesystem, this can be done by
       simply not checking the return code of write (0) and/or the error
       (ENOSPACE) that is set. Over NFS with an async mount, even clients
       with proper error checking will behave this way since the linux NFS
       client implementation will not propagate the server errors [the
       write syscalls immediately return success] until the file handle is
       closed. This leads to a situation where NFS clients send a
       continuous stream of WRITE rpcs which result in ERRNOSPACE -- but
       since the client isn't seeing this, the stream of writes continues
       at maximum network speed.
    
       When some space does appear, multiple writers will all attempt to
       claim it for their current write. For NFS, we may see dozens to
       hundreds of threads that do this.
    
       The real-world scenario of this is database backup tooling (in
       particular, github.com/mdkent/percona-xtrabackup) which may write
       large files (>1TiB) to NFS for safe keeping. Some temporary files
       are written, rewound, and read back -- all before closing the file
       handle (the temp file is actually unlinked, to trigger automatic
       deletion on close/crash.) An application like this operating on an
       async NFS mount will not see an error code until TiB have been
       written/read.
    
       The lockup was observed when running this database backup on large
       filesystems (64 TiB in this case) with a high number of block
       groups and no free space. Fragmentation is generally not a factor
       in this filesystem (~thousands of large files, mostly contiguous
       except for the parts written while the filesystem is at capacity.)

    ext4: fix bug in extents parsing when eh_entries == 0 and eh_depth > 0
    
    commit 29a5b8a137ac8eb410cc823653a29ac0e7b7e1b0 upstream.
    
    When walking through an inode extents, the ext4_ext_binsearch_idx() function
    assumes that the extent header has been previously validated.  However, there
    are no checks that verify that the number of entries (eh->eh_entries) is
    non-zero when depth is > 0.  And this will lead to problems because the
    EXT_FIRST_INDEX() and EXT_LAST_INDEX() will return garbage and result in this:

    ext4: make directory inode spreading reflect flexbg size
    
    commit 613c5a85898d1cd44e68f28d65eccf64a8ace9cf upstream.
    
    Currently the Orlov inode allocator searches for free inodes for a
    directory only in flex block groups with at most inodes_per_group/16
    more directory inodes than average per flex block group. However with
    growing size of flex block group this becomes unnecessarily strict.
    Scale allowed difference from average directory count per flex block
    group with flex block group size as we do with other metrics.

    devdax: Fix soft-reservation memory description
    
    commit 67feaba413ec68daf4124e9870878899b4ed9a0e upstream.
    
    The "hmem" platform-devices that are created to represent the
    platform-advertised "Soft Reserved" memory ranges end up inserting a
    resource that causes the iomem_resource tree to look like this:
    
    340000000-43fffffff : hmem.0
      340000000-43fffffff : Soft Reserved
        340000000-43fffffff : dax0.0
    
    This is because insert_resource() reparents ranges when they completely
    intersect an existing range.
    
    This matters because code that uses region_intersects() to scan for a
    given IORES_DESC will only check that top-level 'hmem.0' resource and
    not the 'Soft Reserved' descendant.
    
    So, to support EINJ (via einj_error_inject()) to inject errors into
    memory hosted by a dax-device, be sure to describe the memory as
    IORES_DESC_SOFT_RESERVED. This is a follow-on to:
    
    commit b13a3e5fd40b ("ACPI: APEI: Fix _EINJ vs EFI_MEMORY_SP")
    
    ...that fixed EINJ support for "Soft Reserved" ranges in the first
    instance.

    [ Upstream commit 37f071ec327b04c83d47637c5e5c2199b39899ca ]
    
    The i2c-mlxbf.c driver is currently broken because there is a bug
    in the calculation of the frequency. core_f, core_r and core_od
    are components read from hardware registers and are used to
    compute the frequency used to compute different timing parameters.
    The shifting mechanism used to get core_f, core_r and core_od is
    wrong. Use FIELD_GET to mask and shift the bitfields properly.

    i2c: mlxbf: incorrect base address passed during io write
    
    [ Upstream commit 2a5be6d1340c0fefcee8a6489cff7fd88a0d5b85 ]
    
    Correct the base address used during io write.
    This bug had no impact over the overall functionality of the read and write
    transactions. MLXBF_I2C_CAUSE_OR_CLEAR=0x18 so writing to (smbus->io + 0x18)
    instead of (mst_cause->ioi + 0x18) actually writes to the sc_low_timeout
    register which just sets the timeout value before a read/write aborts.

    workqueue: don't skip lockdep work dependency in cancel_work_sync()
    
    [ Upstream commit c0feea594e058223973db94c1c32a830c9807c86 ]
    
    Like Hillf Danton mentioned
    
      syzbot should have been able to catch cancel_work_sync() in work context
      by checking lockdep_map in __flush_work() for both flush and cancel.
    
    in [1], being unable to report an obvious deadlock scenario shown below is
    broken. From locking dependency perspective, sync version of cancel request
    should behave as if flush request, for it waits for completion of work if
    that work has already started execution.
    
      ----------
      #include <linux/module.h>
      #include <linux/sched.h>
      static DEFINE_MUTEX(mutex);
      static void work_fn(struct work_struct *work)
      {
        schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(HZ / 5);
        mutex_lock(&mutex);
        mutex_unlock(&mutex);
      }
      static DECLARE_WORK(work, work_fn);
      static int __init test_init(void)
      {
        schedule_work(&work);
        schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(HZ / 10);
        mutex_lock(&mutex);
        cancel_work_sync(&work);
        mutex_unlock(&mutex);
        return -EINVAL;
      }
      module_init(test_init);
      MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
      ----------
    
    The check this patch restores was added by commit 0976dfc1d0cd80a4
    ("workqueue: Catch more locking problems with flush_work()").
    
    Then, lockdep's crossrelease feature was added by commit b09be676e0ff25bd
    ("locking/lockdep: Implement the 'crossrelease' feature"). As a result,
    this check was once removed by commit fd1a5b04dfb899f8 ("workqueue: Remove
    now redundant lock acquisitions wrt. workqueue flushes").
    
    But lockdep's crossrelease feature was removed by commit e966eaeeb623f099
    ("locking/lockdep: Remove the cross-release locking checks"). At this
    point, this check should have been restored.
    
    Then, commit d6e89786bed977f3 ("workqueue: skip lockdep wq dependency in
    cancel_work_sync()") introduced a boolean flag in order to distinguish
    flush_work() and cancel_work_sync(), for checking "struct workqueue_struct"
    dependency when called from cancel_work_sync() was causing false positives.
    
    Then, commit 87915adc3f0acdf0 ("workqueue: re-add lockdep dependencies for
    flushing") tried to restore "struct work_struct" dependency check, but by
    error checked this boolean flag. Like an example shown above indicates,
    "struct work_struct" dependency needs to be checked for both flush_work()
    and cancel_work_sync().

    drm/rockchip: Fix return type of cdn_dp_connector_mode_valid
    
    [ Upstream commit b0b9408f132623dc88e78adb5282f74e4b64bb57 ]
    
    The mode_valid field in drm_connector_helper_funcs is expected to be of
    type:
    enum drm_mode_status (* mode_valid) (struct drm_connector *connector,
                                         struct drm_display_mode *mode);
    
    The mismatched return type breaks forward edge kCFI since the underlying
    function definition does not match the function hook definition.
    
    The return type of cdn_dp_connector_mode_valid should be changed from
    int to enum drm_mode_status.

    drm/amd/display: Mark dml30's UseMinimumDCFCLK() as noinline for stack usage
    
    [ Upstream commit 41012d715d5d7b9751ae84b8fb255e404ac9c5d0 ]
    
    This function consumes a lot of stack space and it blows up the size of
    dml30_ModeSupportAndSystemConfigurationFull() with clang:
    
      drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dml/dcn30/display_mode_vba_30.c:3542:6: error: stack frame size (2200) exceeds limit (2048) in 'dml30_ModeSupportAndSystemConfigurationFull' [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than]
      void dml30_ModeSupportAndSystemConfigurationFull(struct display_mode_lib *mode_lib)
           ^
      1 error generated.
    
    Commit a0f7e7f759cf ("drm/amd/display: fix i386 frame size warning")
    aimed to address this for i386 but it did not help x86_64.
    
    To reduce the amount of stack space that
    dml30_ModeSupportAndSystemConfigurationFull() uses, mark
    UseMinimumDCFCLK() as noinline, using the _for_stack variant for
    documentation. While this will increase the total amount of stack usage
    between the two functions (1632 and 1304 bytes respectively), it will
    make sure both stay below the limit of 2048 bytes for these files. The
    aforementioned change does help reduce UseMinimumDCFCLK()'s stack usage
    so it should not be reverted in favor of this change.

    [ Upstream commit 3601d620f22e37740cf73f8278eabf9f2aa19eb7 ]
    
    [Why]
    For HDR mode, we get total 512 tf_point and after switching to SDR mode
    we actually get 400 tf_point and the rest of points(401~512) still use
    dirty value from HDR mode. We should limit the rest of the points to max
    value.
    
    [How]
    Limit the value when coordinates_x.x > 1, just like what we do in
    translate_from_linear_space for other re-gamma build paths.

    drm/gma500: Fix BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context errors
    
    [ Upstream commit 63e37a79f7bd939314997e29c2f5a9f0ef184281 ]
    
    gma_crtc_page_flip() was holding the event_lock spinlock while calling
    crtc_funcs->mode_set_base() which takes ww_mutex.
    
    The only reason to hold event_lock is to clear gma_crtc->page_flip_event
    on mode_set_base() errors.
    
    Instead unlock it after setting gma_crtc->page_flip_event and on
    errors re-take the lock and clear gma_crtc->page_flip_event it
    it is still set.
    
    This fixes the following WARN/stacktrace:

    Drivers: hv: Never allocate anything besides framebuffer from framebuffer memory region
    
    [ Upstream commit f0880e2cb7e1f8039a048fdd01ce45ab77247221 ]
    
    Passed through PCI device sometimes misbehave on Gen1 VMs when Hyper-V
    DRM driver is also loaded. Looking at IOMEM assignment, we can see e.g.
    
    $ cat /proc/iomem
    ...
    f8000000-fffbffff : PCI Bus 0000:00
      f8000000-fbffffff : 0000:00:08.0
        f8000000-f8001fff : bb8c4f33-2ba2-4808-9f7f-02f3b4da22fe
    ...
    fe0000000-fffffffff : PCI Bus 0000:00
      fe0000000-fe07fffff : bb8c4f33-2ba2-4808-9f7f-02f3b4da22fe
        fe0000000-fe07fffff : 2ba2:00:02.0
          fe0000000-fe07fffff : mlx4_core
    
    the interesting part is the 'f8000000' region as it is actually the
    VM's framebuffer:
    
    $ lspci -v
    ...
    0000:00:08.0 VGA compatible controller: Microsoft Corporation Hyper-V virtual VGA (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
            Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 11
            Memory at f8000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=64M]
    ...

     hyperv_drm 5620e0c7-8062-4dce-aeb7-520c7ef76171: [drm] Synthvid Version major 3, minor 5

     hyperv_drm 0000:00:08.0: BAR 0: can't reserve [mem 0xf8000000-0xfbffffff]
     hyperv_drm 5620e0c7-8062-4dce-aeb7-520c7ef76171: [drm] Cannot request framebuffer, boot fb still active?
    
    Note: "Cannot request framebuffer" is not a fatal error in
    hyperv_setup_gen1() as the code assumes there's some other framebuffer
    device there but we actually have some other PCI device (mlx4 in this
    case) config space there!
    
    The problem appears to be that vmbus_allocate_mmio() can use dedicated
    framebuffer region to serve any MMIO request from any device. The
    semantics one might assume of a parameter named "fb_overlap_ok"
    aren't implemented because !fb_overlap_ok essentially has no effect.
    The existing semantics are really "prefer_fb_overlap". This patch
    implements the expected and needed semantics, which is to not allocate
    from the frame buffer space when !fb_overlap_ok.
    
    Note, Gen2 VMs are usually unaffected by the issue because
    framebuffer region is already taken by EFI fb (in case kernel supports
    it) but Gen1 VMs may have this region unclaimed by the time Hyper-V PCI
    pass-through driver tries allocating MMIO space if Hyper-V DRM/FB drivers
    load after it. Devices can be brought up in any sequence so let's
    resolve the issue by always ignoring 'fb_mmio' region for non-FB
    requests, even if the region is unclaimed.

    drm/amd/amdgpu: fixing read wrong pf2vf data in SRIOV
    
    commit 9a458402fb69bda886aa6cbe067311b6e3d9c52a upstream.
    
    [Why]
    This fixes 892deb48269c ("drm/amdgpu: Separate vf2pf work item init from virt data exchange").
    we should read pf2vf data based at mman.fw_vram_usage_va after gmc
    sw_init. commit 892deb48269c breaks this logic.
    
    [How]
    calling amdgpu_virt_exchange_data in amdgpu_virt_init_data_exchange to
    set the right base in the right sequence.
    
    v2:
    call amdgpu_virt_init_data_exchange after gmc sw_init to make data
    exchange workqueue run
    
    v3:
    clean up the code logic
    
    v4:
    add some comment and make the code more readable

    s390/dasd: fix Oops in dasd_alias_get_start_dev due to missing pavgroup
    
    commit db7ba07108a48c0f95b74fabbfd5d63e924f992d upstream.
    
    Fix Oops in dasd_alias_get_start_dev() function caused by the pavgroup
    pointer being NULL.
    
    The pavgroup pointer is checked on the entrance of the function but
    without the lcu->lock being held. Therefore there is a race window
    between dasd_alias_get_start_dev() and _lcu_update() which sets
    pavgroup to NULL with the lcu->lock held.
    
    Fix by checking the pavgroup pointer with lcu->lock held.

    Consolidate rmap_recycle and rmap_add into a single function since they
    are only ever called together (and only from one place). This has a nice
    side effect of eliminating an extra kvm_vcpu_gfn_to_memslot(). In

    over the ownership of the completed skb to the PTP worker.
    The skb should not be used afterwards, as the worker may
    run before the rest of our code and free the skb, leading
    to a use-after-free.
    
    Since dev_kfree_skb_any() accepts NULL make the loss of
    ownership more obvious and set skb to NULL.

    net: sunhme: Fix packet reception for len < RX_COPY_THRESHOLD
    
    [ Upstream commit 878e2405710aacfeeb19364c300f38b7a9abfe8f ]
    
    There is a separate receive path for small packets (under 256 bytes).
    Instead of allocating a new dma-capable skb to be used for the next packet,
    this path allocates a skb and copies the data into it (reusing the existing
    sbk for the next packet). There are two bytes of junk data at the beginning
    of every packet. I believe these are inserted in order to allow aligned DMA
    and IP headers. We skip over them using skb_reserve. Before copying over
    the data, we must use a barrier to ensure we see the whole packet. The
    current code only synchronizes len bytes, starting from the beginning of
    the packet, including the junk bytes. However, this leaves off the final
    two bytes in the packet. Synchronize the whole packet.
    
    To reproduce this problem, ping a HME with a payload size between 17 and
    214
    
            $ ping -s 17 <hme_address>
    
    which will complain rather loudly about the data mismatch. Small packets
    (below 60 bytes on the wire) do not have this issue. I suspect this is
    related to the padding added to increase the minimum packet size.

    bonding: fix NULL deref in bond_rr_gen_slave_id
    
    [ Upstream commit 0e400d602f46360752e4b32ce842dba3808e15e6 ]
    
    Fix a NULL dereference of the struct bonding.rr_tx_counter member because
    if a bond is initially created with an initial mode != zero (Round Robin)
    the memory required for the counter is never created and when the mode is
    changed there is never any attempt to verify the memory is allocated upon
    switching modes.
    
    This causes the following Oops on an aarch64 machine:

    drm/mediatek: dsi: Move mtk_dsi_stop() call back to mtk_dsi_poweroff()
    
    [ Upstream commit 90144dd8b0d137d9e78ef34b3c418e51a49299ad ]
    
    As the comment right before the mtk_dsi_stop() call advises,
    mtk_dsi_stop() should only be called after
    mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_disable(). That's because that function calls
    drm_crtc_wait_one_vblank(), which requires the vblank irq to be enabled.
    
    Previously mtk_dsi_stop(), being in mtk_dsi_poweroff() and guarded by a
    refcount, would only be called at the end of
    mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_disable(), through the call to mtk_crtc_ddp_hw_fini().
    Commit cde7e2e35c28 ("drm/mediatek: Separate poweron/poweroff from
    enable/disable and define new funcs") moved the mtk_dsi_stop() call to
    mtk_output_dsi_disable(), causing it to be called before
    mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_disable(), and consequently generating vblank
    timeout warnings during suspend.
    
    Move the mtk_dsi_stop() call back to mtk_dsi_poweroff() so that we have
    a working vblank irq during mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_disable() and stop
    getting vblank timeout warnings.

    /proc/kallsyms and /proc/modules are compared before and after the copy
    in order to ensure no changes during the copy.
    
    However /proc/modules also might change due to reference counts changing
    even though that does not make any difference.
    
    Any modules loaded or unloaded should be visible in changes to kallsyms,
    so it is not necessary to check /proc/modules also anyway.
    
    Remove the comparison checking that /proc/modules is unchanged.

    perf stat: Fix BPF program section name
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d77326c3369e255715ed2440a78894ccc98dd69 ]
    
    It seems the recent libbpf got more strict about the section name.
    I'm seeing a failure like this:
    
      $ sudo ./perf stat -a --bpf-counters --for-each-cgroup ^. sleep 1
      libbpf: prog 'on_cgrp_switch': missing BPF prog type, check ELF section name 'perf_events'

      libbpf: failed to load BPF skeleton 'bperf_cgroup_bpf': -22
      Failed to load cgroup skeleton
    
    The section name should be 'perf_event' (without the trailing 's').
    Although it's related to the libbpf change, it'd be better fix the
    section name in the first place.

    net: sh_eth: Fix PHY state warning splat during system resume
    
    [ Upstream commit 6a1dbfefdae4f7809b3e277cc76785dac0ac1cd0 ]
    
    Since commit 744d23c71af39c7d ("net: phy: Warn about incorrect
    mdio_bus_phy_resume() state"), a warning splat is printed during system
    resume with Wake-on-LAN disabled:

    As the Renesas SuperH Ethernet driver already calls phy_{stop,start}()
    in its suspend/resume callbacks, it is sufficient to just mark the MAC
    responsible for managing the power state of the PHY.

    net/sched: taprio: make qdisc_leaf() see the per-netdev-queue pfifo child qdiscs
    
    [ Upstream commit 1461d212ab277d8bba1a753d33e9afe03d81f9d4 ]
    
    taprio can only operate as root qdisc, and to that end, there exists the
    following check in taprio_init(), just as in mqprio:
    
            if (sch->parent != TC_H_ROOT)
                    return -EOPNOTSUPP;
    
    And indeed, when we try to attach taprio to an mqprio child, it fails as
    expected:
    
    $ tc qdisc add dev swp0 root handle 1: mqprio num_tc 8 \
            map 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \
            queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 1@4 1@5 1@6 1@7 hw 0
    $ tc qdisc replace dev swp0 parent 1:2 taprio num_tc 8 \
            map 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \
            queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 1@4 1@5 1@6 1@7 \
            base-time 0 sched-entry S 0x7f 990000 sched-entry S 0x80 100000 \
            flags 0x0 clockid CLOCK_TAI
    Error: sch_taprio: Can only be attached as root qdisc.
    
    (extack message added by me)
    
    But when we try to attach a taprio child to a taprio root qdisc,
    surprisingly it doesn't fail:
    
    $ tc qdisc replace dev swp0 root handle 1: taprio num_tc 8 \
            map 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 1@4 1@5 1@6 1@7 \
            base-time 0 sched-entry S 0x7f 990000 sched-entry S 0x80 100000 \
            flags 0x0 clockid CLOCK_TAI
    $ tc qdisc replace dev swp0 parent 1:2 taprio num_tc 8 \
            map 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \
            queues 1@0 1@1 1@2 1@3 1@4 1@5 1@6 1@7 \
            base-time 0 sched-entry S 0x7f 990000 sched-entry S 0x80 100000 \
            flags 0x0 clockid CLOCK_TAI
    
    This is because tc_modify_qdisc() behaves differently when mqprio is
    root, vs when taprio is root.
    
    In the mqprio case, it finds the parent qdisc through
    p = qdisc_lookup(dev, TC_H_MAJ(clid)), and then the child qdisc through
    q = qdisc_leaf(p, clid). This leaf qdisc q has handle 0, so it is
    ignored according to the comment right below ("It may be default qdisc,
    ignore it"). As a result, tc_modify_qdisc() goes through the
    qdisc_create() code path, and this gives taprio_init() a chance to check
    for sch_parent != TC_H_ROOT and error out.
    
    Whereas in the taprio case, the returned q = qdisc_leaf(p, clid) is
    different. It is not the default qdisc created for each netdev queue
    (both taprio and mqprio call qdisc_create_dflt() and keep them in
    a private q->qdiscs[], or priv->qdiscs[], respectively). Instead, taprio
    makes qdisc_leaf() return the _root_ qdisc, aka itself.
    
    When taprio does that, tc_modify_qdisc() goes through the qdisc_change()
    code path, because the qdisc layer never finds out about the child qdisc
    of the root. And through the ->change() ops, taprio has no reason to
    check whether its parent is root or not, just through ->init(), which is
    not called.
    
    The problem is the taprio_leaf() implementation. Even though code wise,
    it does the exact same thing as mqprio_leaf() which it is copied from,
    it works with different input data. This is because mqprio does not
    attach itself (the root) to each device TX queue, but one of the default
    qdiscs from its private array.
    
    In fact, since commit 13511704f8d7 ("net: taprio offload: enforce qdisc
    to netdev queue mapping"), taprio does this too, but just for the full
    offload case. So if we tried to attach a taprio child to a fully
    offloaded taprio root qdisc, it would properly fail too; just not to a
    software root taprio.
    
    To fix the problem, stop looking at the Qdisc that's attached to the TX
    queue, and instead, always return the default qdiscs that we've
    allocated (and to which we privately enqueue and dequeue, in software
    scheduling mode).
    
    Since Qdisc_class_ops :: leaf  is only called from tc_modify_qdisc(),
    the risk of unforeseen side effects introduced by this change is
    minimal.

    net/sched: taprio: avoid disabling offload when it was never enabled
    
    [ Upstream commit db46e3a88a09c5cf7e505664d01da7238cd56c92 ]
    
    In an incredibly strange API design decision, qdisc->destroy() gets
    called even if qdisc->init() never succeeded, not exclusively since
    commit 87b60cfacf9f ("net_sched: fix error recovery at qdisc creation"),
    but apparently also earlier (in the case of qdisc_create_dflt()).
    
    The taprio qdisc does not fully acknowledge this when it attempts full
    offload, because it starts off with q->flags = TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID in
    taprio_init(), then it replaces q->flags with TCA_TAPRIO_ATTR_FLAGS
    parsed from netlink (in taprio_change(), tail called from taprio_init()).
    
    But in taprio_destroy(), we call taprio_disable_offload(), and this
    determines what to do based on FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED(q->flags).
    
    But looking at the implementation of FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED()
    (a bitwise check of bit 1 in q->flags), it is invalid to call this macro
    on q->flags when it contains TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID, because that is set
    to U32_MAX, and therefore FULL_OFFLOAD_IS_ENABLED() will return true on
    an invalid set of flags.
    
    As a result, it is possible to crash the kernel if user space forces an
    error between setting q->flags = TAPRIO_FLAGS_INVALID, and the calling
    of taprio_enable_offload(). This is because drivers do not expect the
    offload to be disabled when it was never enabled.
    
    The error that we force here is to attach taprio as a non-root qdisc,
    but instead as child of an mqprio root qdisc:
    
    $ tc qdisc add dev swp0 root handle 1: \
            mqprio num_tc 8 map 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \

    The VF netdev driver shouldn't respond to changes in the NETIF_F_HW_TC

    enetc_qos.c, which should not be included in the VF driver.

    wireguard: netlink: avoid variable-sized memcpy on sockaddr
    
    [ Upstream commit 26c013108c12b94bc023bf19198a4300596c98b1 ]
    
    Doing a variable-sized memcpy is slower, and the compiler isn't smart
    enough to turn this into a constant-size assignment.
    
    Further, Kees' latest fortified memcpy will actually bark, because the
    destination pointer is type sockaddr, not explicitly sockaddr_in or
    sockaddr_in6, so it thinks there's an overflow:
    
        memcpy: detected field-spanning write (size 28) of single field
        "&endpoint.addr" at drivers/net/wireguard/netlink.c:446 (size 16)
    
    Fix this by just assigning by using explicit casts for each checked
    case.

    wireguard: ratelimiter: disable timings test by default
    
    [ Upstream commit 684dec3cf45da2b0848298efae4adf3b2aeafeda ]
    
    A previous commit tried to make the ratelimiter timings test more
    reliable but in the process made it less reliable on other
    configurations. This is an impossible problem to solve without
    increasingly ridiculous heuristics. And it's not even a problem that
    actually needs to be solved in any comprehensive way, since this is only
    ever used during development. So just cordon this off with a DEBUG_
    ifdef, just like we do for the trie's randomized tests, so it can be
    enabled while hacking on the code, and otherwise disabled in CI. In the
    process we also revert 151c8e499f47.

    net: ipa: properly limit modem routing table use
    
    [ Upstream commit cf412ec333250cb82bafe57169204e14a9f1c2ac ]
    
    IPA can route packets between IPA-connected entities.  The AP and
    modem are currently the only such entities supported, and no routing
    is required to transfer packets between them.
    
    The number of entries in each routing table is fixed, and defined at
    initialization time.  Some of these entries are designated for use
    by the modem, and the rest are available for the AP to use.  The AP
    sends a QMI message to the modem which describes (among other
    things) information about routing table memory available for the
    modem to use.
    
    Currently the QMI initialization packet gives wrong information in
    its description of routing tables.  What *should* be supplied is the
    maximum index that the modem can use for the routing table memory
    located at a given location.  The current code instead supplies the
    total *number* of routing table entries.  Furthermore, the modem is
    granted the entire table, not just the subset it's supposed to use.
    
    This patch fixes this.  First, the ipa_mem_bounds structure is
    generalized so its "end" field can be interpreted either as a final
    byte offset, or a final array index.  Second, the IPv4 and IPv6
    (non-hashed and hashed) table information fields in the QMI
    ipa_init_modem_driver_req structure are changed to be ipa_mem_bounds
    rather than ipa_mem_array structures.  Third, we set the "end" value
    for each routing table to be the last index, rather than setting the
    "count" to be the number of indices.  Finally, instead of allowing
    the modem to use all of a routing table's memory, it is limited to
    just the portion meant to be used by the modem.  In all versions of
    IPA currently supported, that is IPA_ROUTE_MODEM_COUNT (8) entries.
    
    Update a few comments for clarity.

    [ Upstream commit d8a79c03054911c375a2252627a429c9bc4615b6 ]
    
    The Kconfig symbol depended on MMU but was dropped by the commit
    acad3fe650a5 ("drm/hisilicon: Removed the dependency on the mmu")
    because it already had as a dependency ARM64 that already selects MMU.
    
    But later, commit a0f25a6bb319 ("drm/hisilicon/hibmc: Allow to be built
    if COMPILE_TEST is enabled") allowed the driver to be built for non-ARM64
    when COMPILE_TEST is set but that could lead to unmet direct dependencies
    and linking errors.
    
    Prevent a kconfig warning when MMU is not enabled by making
    DRM_HISI_HIBMC depend on MMU.

    The commit feeb07d0ca5a ("drm/hisilicon/hibmc: Make CONFIG_DRM_HISI_HIBMC

    it only supports that architecture and loading the module on others would
    lead to incorrect video modes being used.
    
    But it also prevented the driver to be built on other architectures which
    is useful to have compile test coverage when doing subsystem wide changes.
    
    Make the dependency instead to be (ARM64 || COMPILE_TEST), so the driver
    is buildable when the CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST option is enabled.

    sfc: fix null pointer dereference in efx_hard_start_xmit
    
    [ Upstream commit 0a242eb2913a4aa3d6fbdb86559f27628e9466f3 ]
    
    Trying to get the channel from the tx_queue variable here is wrong
    because we can only be here if tx_queue is NULL, so we shouldn't
    dereference it. As the above comment in the code says, this is very
    unlikely to happen, but it's wrong anyway so let's fix it.
    
    I hit this issue because of a different bug that caused tx_queue to be
    NULL. If that happens, this is the error message that we get here:
      BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000020

    In legacy interrupt mode the tx_channel_offset was hardcoded to 1, but
    that's not correct if efx_sepparate_tx_channels is false. In that case,

    at index 0, together with the rx queue.

    i40e: Fix set max_tx_rate when it is lower than 1 Mbps
    
    [ Upstream commit 198eb7e1b81d8ba676d0f4f120c092032ae69a8e ]
    
    While converting max_tx_rate from bytes to Mbps, this value was set to 0,
    if the original value was lower than 125000 bytes (1 Mbps). This would
    cause no transmission rate limiting to occur. This happened due to lack of
    check of max_tx_rate against the 1 Mbps value for max_tx_rate and the
    following division by 125000. Fix this issue by adding a helper
    i40e_bw_bytes_to_mbits() which sets max_tx_rate to minimum usable value of
    50 Mbps, if its value is less than 1 Mbps, otherwise do the required
    conversion by dividing by 125000.

    iavf: Fix set max MTU size with port VLAN and jumbo frames
    
    [ Upstream commit 399c98c4dc50b7eb7e9f24da7ffdda6f025676ef ]
    
    After setting port VLAN and MTU to 9000 on VF with ice driver there
    was an iavf error
    "PF returned error -5 (IAVF_ERR_PARAM) to our request 6".
    
    During queue configuration, VF's max packet size was set to
    IAVF_MAX_RXBUFFER but on ice max frame size was smaller by VLAN_HLEN
    due to making some space for port VLAN as VF is not aware whether it's
    in a port VLAN. This mismatch in sizes caused ice to reject queue
    configuration with ERR_PARAM error. Proper max_mtu is sent from ice PF
    to VF with GET_VF_RESOURCES msg but VF does not look at this.
    
    In iavf change max_frame from IAVF_MAX_RXBUFFER to max_mtu
    received from pf with GET_VF_RESOURCES msg to make vf's
    max_frame_size dependent from pf. Add check if received max_mtu is
    not in eligible range then set it to IAVF_MAX_RXBUFFER.

    That "/dev/tty" came from the command line (which is automatically
    added if no console= parameter was specified for the uml binary).
    
    The TLDP project tells the following about the /dev/tty:
    <https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO-7.html#ss7.3>
    | /dev/tty stands for the controlling terminal (if any) for the current
    | process.[...]
    | /dev/tty is something like a link to the actually terminal device[..]
    
    The "(if any)" is important here, since it's possible for processes to
    not have a controlling terminal.
    
    I think this was a simple typo and the author wanted tty0 there.

    MIPS: Loongson32: Fix PHY-mode being left unspecified
    
    [ Upstream commit e9f3f8f488005f6da3cfb66070706770ecaef747 ]
    
    commit 0060c8783330 ("net: stmmac: implement support for passive mode
    converters via dt") has changed the plat->interface field semantics from
    containing the PHY-mode to specifying the MAC-PCS interface mode. Due to
    that the loongson32 platform code will leave the phylink interface
    uninitialized with the PHY-mode intended by the means of the actual
    platform setup. The commit-author most likely has just missed the
    arch-specific code to fix. Let's mend the Loongson32 platform code then by
    assigning the PHY-mode to the phy_interface field of the STMMAC platform
    data.

    net: team: Unsync device addresses on ndo_stop
    
    [ Upstream commit bd60234222b2fd5573526da7bcd422801f271f5f ]
    
    Netdev drivers are expected to call dev_{uc,mc}_sync() in their
    ndo_set_rx_mode method and dev_{uc,mc}_unsync() in their ndo_stop method.
    This is mentioned in the kerneldoc for those dev_* functions.
    
    The team driver calls dev_{uc,mc}_unsync() during ndo_uninit instead of
    ndo_stop. This is ineffective because address lists (dev->{uc,mc}) have
    already been emptied in unregister_netdevice_many() before ndo_uninit is
    called. This mistake can result in addresses being leftover on former team
    ports after a team device has been deleted; see test_LAG_cleanup() in the
    last patch in this series.
    
    Add unsync calls at their expected location, team_close().
    
    v3:
    * When adding or deleting a port, only sync/unsync addresses if the team
      device is up. In other cases, it is taken care of at the right time by

    [ Upstream commit ca2dccdeeb49a7e408112d681bf447984c845292 ]
    
    The Aquantia datasheet notes that after issuing a Processor-Intensive
    MDIO operation, like changing the low-power state of the device, the
    driver should wait for the operation to finish before issuing a new MDIO
    command.
    
    The new aqr107_wait_processor_intensive_op() function is added which can
    be used after these kind of MDIO operations. At the moment, we are only
    adding it at the end of the suspend/resume calls.
    
    The issue was identified on a board featuring the AQR113C PHY, on
    which commands like 'ip link (..) up / down' issued without any delays
    between them would render the link on the PHY to remain down.
    The issue was easy to reproduce with a one-liner:
     $ ip link set dev ethX down; ip link set dev ethX up; \
     ip link set dev ethX down; ip link set dev ethX up;

    net: core: fix flow symmetric hash
    
    [ Upstream commit 64ae13ed478428135cddc2f1113dff162d8112d4 ]
    
    __flow_hash_consistentify() wrongly swaps ipv4 addresses in few cases.
    This function is indirectly used by __skb_get_hash_symmetric(), which is
    used to fanout packets in AF_PACKET.
    Intrusion detection systems may be impacted by this issue.
    
    __flow_hash_consistentify() computes the addresses difference then swaps
    them if the difference is negative. In few cases src - dst and dst - src
    are both negative.
    
    The following snippet mimics __flow_hash_consistentify():
    
    ```
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdint.h>
    
     int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    
         int diffs_d, diffd_s;
         uint32_t dst  = 0xb225a8c0; /* 178.37.168.192 --> 192.168.37.178 */
         uint32_t src  = 0x3225a8c0; /*  50.37.168.192 --> 192.168.37.50  */
         uint32_t dst2 = 0x3325a8c0; /*  51.37.168.192 --> 192.168.37.51  */
    
         diffs_d = src - dst;
         diffd_s = dst - src;
    
         printf("src:%08x dst:%08x, diff(s-d)=%d(0x%x) diff(d-s)=%d(0x%x)\n",
                 src, dst, diffs_d, diffs_d, diffd_s, diffd_s);
    
         diffs_d = src - dst2;
         diffd_s = dst2 - src;
    
         printf("src:%08x dst:%08x, diff(s-d)=%d(0x%x) diff(d-s)=%d(0x%x)\n",
                 src, dst2, diffs_d, diffs_d, diffd_s, diffd_s);
    
         return 0;
     }
    ```
    
    Results:
    
    src:3225a8c0 dst:b225a8c0, \
        diff(s-d)=-2147483648(0x80000000) \
        diff(d-s)=-2147483648(0x80000000)
    
    src:3225a8c0 dst:3325a8c0, \
        diff(s-d)=-16777216(0xff000000) \
        diff(d-s)=16777216(0x1000000)
    
    In the first case the addresses differences are always < 0, therefore
    __flow_hash_consistentify() always swaps, thus dst->src and src->dst
    packets have differents hashes.

    ipvlan: Fix out-of-bound bugs caused by unset skb->mac_header
    
    [ Upstream commit 81225b2ea161af48e093f58e8dfee6d705b16af4 ]
    
    If an AF_PACKET socket is used to send packets through ipvlan and the
    default xmit function of the AF_PACKET socket is changed from
    dev_queue_xmit() to packet_direct_xmit() via setsockopt() with the option
    name of PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS, the skb->mac_header may not be reset and
    remains as the initial value of 65535, this may trigger slab-out-of-bounds
    bugs as following:
    
    =================================================================

    entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x63/0xcd
    
    The root cause is:
      1. packet_snd() only reset skb->mac_header when sock->type is SOCK_RAW
         and skb->protocol is not specified as in packet_parse_headers()
    
      2. packet_direct_xmit() doesn't reset skb->mac_header as dev_queue_xmit()
    
    In this case, skb->mac_header is 65535 when ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2() is
    called. So when ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2() gets mac header with eth_hdr() which
    use "skb->head + skb->mac_header", out-of-bound access occurs.
    
    This patch replaces eth_hdr() with skb_eth_hdr() in ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2()
    and reset mac header in multicast to solve this out-of-bound bug.

    prepare_for_reset function, as this is a common place for all reset flows.
    It also has built in protection from being called twice in a single reset

    netfilter: nf_conntrack_sip: fix ct_sip_walk_headers
    
    [ Upstream commit 39aebedeaaa95757f5c1f2ddb5f43fdddbf478ca ]
    
    ct_sip_next_header and ct_sip_get_header return an absolute
    value of matchoff, not a shift from current dataoff.
    So dataoff should be assigned matchoff, not incremented by it.
    
    This issue can be seen in the scenario when there are multiple
    Contact headers and the first one is using a hostname and other headers
    use IP addresses. In this case, ct_sip_walk_headers will work as follows:
    
    The first ct_sip_get_header call to will find the first Contact header
    but will return -1 as the header uses a hostname. But matchoff will
    be changed to the offset of this header. After that, dataoff should be
    set to matchoff, so that the next ct_sip_get_header call find the next
    Contact header. But instead of assigning dataoff to matchoff, it is
    incremented by it, which is not correct, as matchoff is an absolute
    value of the offset. So on the next call to the ct_sip_get_header,
    dataoff will be incorrect, and the next Contact header may not be
    found at all.

    arm64: dts: rockchip: Set RK3399-Gru PCLK_EDP to 24 MHz
    
    [ Upstream commit 8123437cf46ea5a0f6ca5cb3c528d8b6db97b9c2 ]
    
    We've found the AUX channel to be less reliable with PCLK_EDP at a
    higher rate (typically 25 MHz). This is especially important on systems
    with PSR-enabled panels (like Gru-Kevin), since we make heavy, constant
    use of AUX.
    
    According to Rockchip, using any rate other than 24 MHz can cause
    "problems between syncing the PHY an PCLK", which leads to all sorts of
    unreliabilities around register operations.

    arm64: dts: rockchip: Pull up wlan wake# on Gru-Bob
    
    [ Upstream commit e5467359a725de90b6b8d0dd865500f6373828ca ]
    
    The Gru-Bob board does not have a pull-up resistor on its
    WLAN_HOST_WAKE# pin, but Kevin does. The production/vendor kernel
    specified the pin configuration correctly as a pull-up, but this didn't
    get ported correctly to upstream.
    
    This means Bob's WLAN_HOST_WAKE# pin is floating, causing inconsistent
    wakeup behavior.
    
    Note that bt_host_wake_l has a similar dynamic, but apparently the
    upstream choice was to redundantly configure both internal and external
    pull-up on Kevin (see the "Kevin has an external pull up" comment in
    rk3399-gru.dtsi). This doesn't cause any functional problem, although
    it's perhaps wasteful.

    firmware: arm_scmi: Fix the asynchronous reset requests
    
    [ Upstream commit b75c83d9b961fd3abf7310f8d36d5e6e9f573efb ]
    
    SCMI Reset protocol specification allows the asynchronous reset request
    only when an autonomous reset action is specified. Reset requests based
    on explicit assert/deassert of signals should not be served
    asynchronously.
    
    Current implementation will instead issue an asynchronous request in any
    case, as long as the reset domain had advertised to support asynchronous
    resets.
    
    Avoid requesting the asynchronous resets when the reset action is not
    of the autonomous type, even if the target reset domain does, in general,
    support the asynchronous requests.

    xfs: validate inode fork size against fork format
    
    [ Upstream commit 1eb70f54c445fcbb25817841e774adb3d912f3e8 ]
    
    xfs_repair catches fork size/format mismatches, but the in-kernel
    verifier doesn't, leading to null pointer failures when attempting
    to perform operations on the fork. This can occur in the
    xfs_dir_is_empty() where the in-memory fork format does not match
    the size and so the fork data pointer is accessed incorrectly.
    
    Note: this causes new failures in xfs/348 which is testing mode vs
    ftype mismatches. We now detect a regular file that has been changed
    to a directory or symlink mode as being corrupt because the data
    fork is for a symlink or directory should be in local form when
    there are only 3 bytes of data in the data fork. Hence the inode
    verify for the regular file now fires w/ -EFSCORRUPTED because
    the inode fork format does not match the format the corrupted mode
    says it should be in.

    xfs: reorder iunlink remove operation in xfs_ifree
    
    [ Upstream commit 9a5280b312e2e7898b6397b2ca3cfd03f67d7be1 ]
    
    The O_TMPFILE creation implementation creates a specific order of
    operations for inode allocation/freeing and unlinked list
    modification. Currently both are serialised by the AGI, so the order
    doesn't strictly matter as long as the are both in the same
    transaction.
    
    However, if we want to move the unlinked list insertions largely out
    from under the AGI lock, then we have to be concerned about the
    order in which we do unlinked list modification operations.
    O_TMPFILE creation tells us this order is inode allocation/free,
    then unlinked list modification.
    
    Change xfs_ifree() to use this same ordering on unlinked list
    removal. This way we always guarantee that when we enter the
    iunlinked list removal code from this path, we already have the AGI
    locked and we don't have to worry about lock nesting AGI reads
    inside unlink list locks because it's already locked and attached to
    the transaction.
    
    We can do this safely as the inode freeing and unlinked list removal
    are done in the same transaction and hence are atomic operations
    with respect to log recovery.

    vmlinux.lds.h: CFI: Reduce alignment of jump-table to function alignment
    
    commit 13b0566962914e167cb3238fbe29ced618f07a27 upstream.
    
    Due to undocumented, hysterical raisins on x86, the CFI jump-table
    sections in .text are needlessly aligned to PMD_SIZE in the vmlinux
    linker script. When compiling a CFI-enabled arm64 kernel with a 64KiB
    page-size, a PMD maps 512MiB of virtual memory and so the .text section
    increases to a whopping 940MiB and blows the final Image up to 960MiB.
    Others report a link failure.
    
    Since the CFI jump-table requires only instruction alignment, reduce the
    alignment directives to function alignment for parity with other parts
    of the .text section. This reduces the size of the .text section for the
    aforementioned 64KiB page size arm64 kernel to 19MiB for a much more
    reasonable total Image size of 39MiB.

    commit d4955c0ad77dbc684fc716387070ac24801b8bca upstream.
    
    cpufreq_get_hw_max_freq() returns max frequency in kHz as *unsigned int*,
    while freq_inv_set_max_ratio() gets passed this frequency in Hz as 'u64'.
    Multiplying max frequency by 1000 can potentially result in overflow --
    multiplying by 1000ULL instead should avoid that...

    KVM: x86: Inject #UD on emulated XSETBV if XSAVES isn't enabled
    
    commit 50b2d49bafa16e6311ab2da82f5aafc5f9ada99b upstream.
    
    Inject #UD when emulating XSETBV if CR4.OSXSAVE is not set.  This also
    covers the "XSAVE not supported" check, as setting CR4.OSXSAVE=1 #GPs if
    XSAVE is not supported (and userspace gets to keep the pieces if it
    forces incoherent vCPU state).
    
    Add a comment to kvm_emulate_xsetbv() to call out that the CPU checks
    CR4.OSXSAVE before checking for intercepts.  AMD'S APM implies that #UD
    has priority (says that intercepts are checked before #GP exceptions),
    while Intel's SDM says nothing about interception priority.  However,
    testing on hardware shows that both AMD and Intel CPUs prioritize the #UD
    over interception.

    The following happened on an i.MX25 using flexcan with many packets on
    the bus:
    
    The rx-offload queue reached a length more than skb_queue_len_max. In
    can_rx_offload_offload_one() the drop variable was set to true which
    made the call to .mailbox_read() (here: flexcan_mailbox_read()) to
    _always_ return ERR_PTR(-ENOBUFS) and drop the rx'ed CAN frame. So
    can_rx_offload_offload_one() returned ERR_PTR(-ENOBUFS), too.
    
    can_rx_offload_irq_offload_fifo() looks as follows:
    
    |       while (1) {
    |               skb = can_rx_offload_offload_one(offload, 0);
    |               if (IS_ERR(skb))
    |                       continue;
    |               if (!skb)
    |                       break;
    |               ...
    |       }
    
    The flexcan driver wrongly always returns ERR_PTR(-ENOBUFS) if drop is
    requested, even if there is no CAN frame pending. As the i.MX25 is a
    single core CPU, while the rx-offload processing is active, there is
    no thread to process packets from the offload queue. So the queue
    doesn't get any shorter and this results is a tight loop.
    
    Instead of always returning ERR_PTR(-ENOBUFS) if drop is requested,
    return NULL if no CAN frame is pending.
    
    Changes since v1: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220810144536.389237-1-u.kleine-koenig@pengutronix.de
    - don't break in can_rx_offload_irq_offload_fifo() in case of an error,
      return NULL in flexcan_mailbox_read() in case of no pending CAN frame
      instead

    kasan: call kasan_malloc() from __kmalloc_*track_caller()
    
    commit 5373b8a09d6e037ee0587cb5d9fe4cc09077deeb upstream.
    
    We were failing to call kasan_malloc() from __kmalloc_*track_caller()
    which was causing us to sometimes fail to produce KASAN error reports
    for allocations made using e.g. devm_kcalloc(), as the KASAN poison was
    not being initialized. Fix it.

    riscv: fix a nasty sigreturn bug...
    
    commit 762df359aa5849e010ef04c3ed79d57588ce17d9 upstream.
    
    riscv has an equivalent of arm bug fixed by 653d48b22166 ("arm: fix
    really nasty sigreturn bug"); if signal gets caught by an interrupt that
    hits when we have the right value in a0 (-513), *and* another signal
    gets delivered upon sigreturn() (e.g. included into the blocked mask for
    the first signal and posted while the handler had been running), the
    syscall restart logics will see regs->cause equal to EXC_SYSCALL (we are
    in a syscall, after all) and a0 already restored to its original value
    (-513, which happens to be -ERESTARTNOINTR) and assume that we need to
    apply the usual syscall restart logics.

    gpiolib: cdev: Set lineevent_state::irq after IRQ register successfully
    
    commit 69bef19d6b9700e96285f4b4e28691cda3dcd0d1 upstream.
    
    When running gpio test on nxp-ls1028 platform with below command
    gpiomon --num-events=3 --rising-edge gpiochip1 25
    There will be a warning trace as below:
    Call trace:
    free_irq+0x204/0x360
    lineevent_free+0x64/0x70
    gpio_ioctl+0x598/0x6a0

    invoke_syscall+0x5c/0x130
    ......
    el0t_64_sync+0x1a0/0x1a4
    The reason of this issue is that calling request_threaded_irq()
    function failed, and then lineevent_free() is invoked to release
    the resource. Since the lineevent_state::irq was already set, so
    the subsequent invocation of free_irq() would trigger the above
    warning call trace. To fix this issue, set the lineevent_state::irq
    after the IRQ register successfully.

    efi: libstub: check Shim mode using MokSBStateRT
    
    commit 5f56a74cc0a6d9b9f8ba89cea29cd7c4774cb2b1 upstream.
    
    We currently check the MokSBState variable to decide whether we should
    treat UEFI secure boot as being disabled, even if the firmware thinks
    otherwise. This is used by shim to indicate that it is not checking
    signatures on boot images. In the kernel, we use this to relax lockdown
    policies.
    
    However, in cases where shim is not even being used, we don't want this
    variable to interfere with lockdown, given that the variable may be
    non-volatile and therefore persist across a reboot. This means setting
    it once will persistently disable lockdown checks on a given system.
    
    So switch to the mirrored version of this variable, called MokSBStateRT,
    which is supposed to be volatile, and this is something we can check.

    efi: x86: Wipe setup_data on pure EFI boot
    
    commit 63bf28ceb3ebbe76048c3fb2987996ca1ae64f83 upstream.
    
    When booting the x86 kernel via EFI using the LoadImage/StartImage boot
    services [as opposed to the deprecated EFI handover protocol], the setup
    header is taken from the image directly, and given that EFI's LoadImage
    has no Linux/x86 specific knowledge regarding struct bootparams or
    struct setup_header, any absolute addresses in the setup header must
    originate from the file and not from a prior loading stage.
    
    Since we cannot generally predict where LoadImage() decides to load an
    image (*), such absolute addresses must be treated as suspect: even if a
    prior boot stage intended to make them point somewhere inside the
    [signed] image, there is no way to validate that, and if they point at
    an arbitrary location in memory, the setup_data nodes will not be
    covered by any signatures or TPM measurements either, and could be made
    to contain an arbitrary sequence of SETUP_xxx nodes, which could
    interfere quite badly with the early x86 boot sequence.
    
    (*) Note that, while LoadImage() does take a buffer/size tuple in
    addition to a device path, which can be used to provide the image
    contents directly, it will re-allocate such images, as the memory
    footprint of an image is generally larger than the PE/COFF file
    representation.

    usb: dwc3: core: leave default DMA if the controller does not support 64-bit DMA
    
    commit 91062e663b261815573ce00967b1895a99e668df upstream.
    
    On some DWC3 controllers (e.g. Rockchip SoCs), the DWC3 core
    doesn't support 64-bit DMA address width. In this case, this
    driver should use the default 32-bit mask. Otherwise, the DWC3
    controller will break if it runs on above 4GB physical memory
    environment.
    
    This patch reads the DWC_USB3_AWIDTH bits of GHWPARAMS0 which
    used for the DMA address width, and only configure 64-bit DMA
    mask if the DWC_USB3_AWIDTH is 64.

    What happens is the following:
    
    1) The cleaner kthread tries to start a transaction to delete an unused
       block group, but the metadata reservation can not be satisfied right
       away, so a reservation ticket is created and it starts the async
       metadata reclaim task (fs_info->async_reclaim_work);
    
    2) Writeback for all the filler inodes with an i_size of 2K starts
       (generic/562 creates a lot of 2K files with the goal of filling
       metadata space). We try to create an inline extent for them, but we
       fail when trying to insert the inline extent with -ENOSPC (at
       cow_file_range_inline()) - since this is not critical, we fallback
       to non-inline mode (back to cow_file_range()), reserve extents, create
       extent maps and create the ordered extents;
    
    3) An unmount starts, enters close_ctree();
    
    4) The async reclaim task is flushing stuff, entering the flush states one
       by one, until it reaches RUN_DELAYED_IPUTS. There it runs all current
       delayed iputs.
    
       After running the delayed iputs and before calling
       btrfs_wait_on_delayed_iputs(), one or more ordered extents complete,
       and btrfs_add_delayed_iput() is called for each one through
       btrfs_finish_ordered_io() -> btrfs_put_ordered_extent(). This results
       in bumping fs_info->nr_delayed_iputs from 0 to some positive value.
    
       So the async reclaim task blocks at btrfs_wait_on_delayed_iputs() waiting
       for fs_info->nr_delayed_iputs to become 0;
    
    5) The current transaction is committed by the transaction kthread, we then
       start unpinning extents and end up calling btrfs_try_granting_tickets()
       through unpin_extent_range(), since we released some space.
       This results in satisfying the ticket created by the cleaner kthread at
       step 1, waking up the cleaner kthread;
    
    6) At close_ctree() we ask the cleaner kthread to park;
    
    7) The cleaner kthread starts the transaction, deletes the unused block
       group, and then calls kthread_should_park(), which returns true, so it
       parks. And at this point we have the delayed iputs added by the
       completion of the ordered extents still pending;
    
    8) Then later at close_ctree(), when we call:
    
           cancel_work_sync(&fs_info->async_reclaim_work);
    
       We hang forever, since the cleaner was parked and no one else can run
       delayed iputs after that, while the reclaim task is waiting for the
       remaining delayed iputs to be completed.
    
    Fix this by waiting for all ordered extents to complete and running the
    delayed iputs before attempting to stop the async reclaim tasks. Note that
    we can not wait for ordered extents with btrfs_wait_ordered_roots() (or
    other similar functions) because that waits for the BTRFS_ORDERED_COMPLETE
    flag to be set on an ordered extent, but the delayed iput is added after
    that, when doing the final btrfs_put_ordered_extent(). So instead wait for
    the work queues used for executing ordered extent completion to be empty,
    which works because we do the final put on an ordered extent at
    btrfs_finish_ordered_io() (while we are in the unmount context).

    btrfs: fix hang during unmount when stopping block group reclaim worker
    
    commit 8a1f1e3d1eecf9d2359a2709e276743a67e145db upstream.
    
    During early unmount, at close_ctree(), we try to stop the block group
    reclaim task with cancel_work_sync(), but that may hang if the block group
    reclaim task is currently at btrfs_relocate_block_group() waiting for the
    flag BTRFS_FS_UNFINISHED_DROPS to be cleared from fs_info->flags. During
    unmount we only clear that flag later, after trying to stop the block
    group reclaim task.
    
    Fix that by clearing BTRFS_FS_UNFINISHED_DROPS before trying to stop the
    block group reclaim task and after setting BTRFS_FS_CLOSING_START, so that
    if the reclaim task is waiting on that bit, it will stop immediately after
    being woken, because it sees the filesystem is closing (with a call to
    btrfs_fs_closing()), and then returns immediately with -EINTR.

    ALSA: core: Fix double-free at snd_card_new()
    
    commit c3afa2a402d1ecefa59f88d55d9e765f52f75bd9 upstream.
    
    During the code change to add the support for devres-managed card
    instance, we put an explicit kfree(card) call at the error path in
    snd_card_new().  This is needed for the early error path before the
    card is initialized with the device, but is rather superfluous and
    causes a double-free at the error path after the card instance is
    initialized, as the destructor of the card object already contains a
    kfree() call.
    
    This patch fixes the double-free situation by removing the superfluous
    kfree().  Meanwhile we need to call kfree() explicitly for the early
    error path, so it's added there instead.

    drivers/base: Fix unsigned comparison to -1 in CPUMAP_FILE_MAX_BYTES
    
    commit d7f06bdd6ee87fbefa05af5f57361d85e7715b11 upstream.
    
    As PAGE_SIZE is unsigned long, -1 > PAGE_SIZE when NR_CPUS <= 3.
    This leads to very large file sizes:
    
    topology$ ls -l
    total 0

    Adjust the inequality to catch the case when NR_CPUS is configured

    usb: add quirks for Lenovo OneLink+ Dock
    
    [ Upstream commit 3d5f70949f1b1168fbb17d06eb5c57e984c56c58 ]
    
    The Lenovo OneLink+ Dock contains two VL812 USB3.0 controllers:
    17ef:1018 upstream
    17ef:1019 downstream
    
    Those two controllers both have problems with some USB3.0 devices,
    particularly self-powered ones. Typical error messages include:
    
      Timeout while waiting for setup device command
      device not accepting address X, error -62
      unable to enumerate USB device
    
    By process of elimination the controllers themselves were identified as
    the cause of the problem. Through trial and error the issue was solved
    by using USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME for both chips.

    [ Upstream commit 040f2dbd2010c43f33ad27249e6dac48456f4d99 ]
    
    Relocate the pullups_connected check until after it is ensured that there
    are no runtime PM transitions.  If another context triggered the DWC3
    core's runtime resume, it may have already enabled the Run/Stop.  Do not
    re-run the entire pullup sequence again, as it may issue a core soft
    reset while Run/Stop is already set.

    [ Upstream commit 8f8034f493b5eb1ad21ff392fd30c0cf9e71f73f ]
    
    If the GEVNTCOUNT indicates events in the event buffer, the driver needs
    to acknowledge them before the controller can halt. Simply let the
    interrupt handler acknowledges the remaining event generated by the
    controller while polling for DSTS.DEVCTLHLT. This avoids disabling irq
    and taking care of race condition between the interrupt handlers and
    pullup().

    [ Upstream commit 69e131d1ac4e52a59ec181ab4f8aa8c48cd8fb64 ]
    
    Don't do soft-disconnect if it's previously done. Likewise, don't do
    soft-connect if the device is currently connected and running. It would
    break normal operation.
    
    Currently the caller of pullup() (udc's sysfs soft_connect) only checks
    if it had initiated disconnect to prevent repeating soft-disconnect. It
    doesn't check for soft-connect. To be safe, let's keep the check here
    regardless whether the udc core is fixed.

    usb: dwc3: Issue core soft reset before enabling run/stop
    
    [ Upstream commit 0066472de157439d58454f4a55786f1045ea5681 ]
    
    It is recommended by the Synopsis databook to issue a DCTL.CSftReset
    when reconnecting from a device-initiated disconnect routine.  This
    resolves issues with enumeration during fast composition switching
    cases, which result in an unknown device on the host.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: Avoid starting DWC3 gadget during UDC unbind
    
    [ Upstream commit 8217f07a50236779880f13e87f99224cd9117f83 ]
    
    There is a race present where the DWC3 runtime resume runs in parallel
    to the UDC unbind sequence.  This will eventually lead to a possible
    scenario where we are enabling the run/stop bit, without a valid
    composition defined.
    
    Thread#1 (handling UDC unbind):
    usb_gadget_remove_driver()
    -->usb_gadget_disconnect()
      -->dwc3_gadget_pullup(0)
    --> continue UDC unbind sequence
    -->Thread#2 is running in parallel here
    
    Thread#2 (handing next cable connect)
    __dwc3_set_mode()
      -->pm_runtime_get_sync()
        -->dwc3_gadget_resume()
          -->dwc->gadget_driver is NOT NULL yet
          -->dwc3_gadget_run_stop(1)
          --> _dwc3gadget_start()
    ...
    
    Fix this by tracking the pullup disable routine, and avoiding resuming
    of the DWC3 gadget.  Once the UDC is re-binded, that will trigger the
    pullup enable routine, which would handle enabling the DWC3 gadget.

    [ Upstream commit e01f5c8d6af231b3b09e23c1fe8a4057cdcc4e42 ]
    
    This device is reported as using the RTL8188EUS chip.
    
    It has the improbable USB ID of 0bda:ffef, which normally would belong
    to Realtek, but this ID works for the reporter.

    [ Upstream commit 6723b283c44a3fdf9f922ae9788aab38bd909211 ]
    
    The new r8188eu driver doesn't actually support devices with vendor ID 0bda
    and product ID f179[0][1][2], remove the ID so owners of these devices
    don't have to blacklist the staging driver.

    drm/amdgpu: make sure to init common IP before gmc
    
    [ Upstream commit a8671493d2074950553da3cf07d1be43185ef6c6 ]
    
    Move common IP init before GMC init so that HDP gets
    remapped before GMC init which uses it.
    
    This fixes the Unsupported Request error reported through
    AER during driver load. The error happens as a write happens
    to the remap offset before real remapping is done.
    
    Link: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=216373
    
    The error was unnoticed before and got visible because of the commit
    referenced below. This doesn't fix anything in the commit below, rather
    fixes the issue in amdgpu exposed by the commit. The reference is only
    to associate this commit with below one so that both go together.

    drm/amdgpu: Separate vf2pf work item init from virt data exchange
    
    [ Upstream commit 892deb48269c65376f3eeb5b4c032ff2c2979bd7 ]
    
    We want to be able to call virt data exchange conditionally
    after gmc sw init to reserve bad pages as early as possible.
    Since this is a conditional call, we will need
    to call it again unconditionally later in the init sequence.
    
    Refactor the data exchange function so it can be
    called multiple times without re-initializing the work item.
    
    v2: Cleaned up the code. Kept the original call to init_exchange_data()
    inside early init to initialize the work item, afterwards call
    exchange_data() when needed.
