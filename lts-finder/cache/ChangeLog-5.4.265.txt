    powerpc/ftrace: Fix stack teardown in ftrace_no_trace
    
    commit 4b3338aaa74d7d4ec5b6734dc298f0db94ec83d2 upstream.
    
    Commit 41a506ef71eb ("powerpc/ftrace: Create a dummy stackframe to fix
    stack unwind") added use of a new stack frame on ftrace entry to fix
    stack unwind. However, the commit missed updating the offset used while
    tearing down the ftrace stack when ftrace is disabled. Fix the same.
    
    In addition, the commit missed saving the correct stack pointer in
    pt_regs. Update the same.

    powerpc/ftrace: Create a dummy stackframe to fix stack unwind
    
    commit 41a506ef71eb38d94fe133f565c87c3e06ccc072 upstream.
    
    With ppc64 -mprofile-kernel and ppc32 -pg, profiling instructions to
    call into ftrace are emitted right at function entry. The instruction
    sequence used is minimal to reduce overhead. Crucially, a stackframe is
    not created for the function being traced. This breaks stack unwinding
    since the function being traced does not have a stackframe for itself.
    As such, it never shows up in the backtrace:
    
    /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/stack_tracer_enabled
    /sys/kernel/debug/tracing # cat stack_trace

    Fix this by having ftrace create a dummy stackframe for the function
    being traced. With this, backtraces now capture the function being
    traced:

    This results in two additional stores in the ftrace entry code, but
    produces reliable backtraces.

    ring-buffer: Fix memory leak of free page
    
    commit 17d801758157bec93f26faaf5ff1a8b9a552d67a upstream.
    
    Reading the ring buffer does a swap of a sub-buffer within the ring buffer
    with a empty sub-buffer. This allows the reader to have full access to the
    content of the sub-buffer that was swapped out without having to worry
    about contention with the writer.
    
    The readers call ring_buffer_alloc_read_page() to allocate a page that
    will be used to swap with the ring buffer. When the code is finished with
    the reader page, it calls ring_buffer_free_read_page(). Instead of freeing
    the page, it stores it as a spare. Then next call to
    ring_buffer_alloc_read_page() will return this spare instead of calling
    into the memory management system to allocate a new page.
    
    Unfortunately, on freeing of the ring buffer, this spare page is not
    freed, and causes a memory leak.

    team: Fix use-after-free when an option instance allocation fails
    
    commit c12296bbecc488623b7d1932080e394d08f3226b upstream.
    
    In __team_options_register, team_options are allocated and appended to
    the team's option_list.
    If one option instance allocation fails, the "inst_rollback" cleanup
    path frees the previously allocated options but doesn't remove them from
    the team's option_list.
    This leaves dangling pointers that can be dereferenced later by other
    parts of the team driver that iterate over options.
    
    This patch fixes the cleanup path to remove the dangling pointers from
    the list.
    
    As far as I can tell, this uaf doesn't have much security implications
    since it would be fairly hard to exploit (an attacker would need to make
    the allocation of that specific small object fail) but it's still nice
    to fix.

    arm64: mm: Always make sw-dirty PTEs hw-dirty in pte_modify
    
    commit 3c0696076aad60a2f04c019761921954579e1b0e upstream.
    
    It is currently possible for a userspace application to enter an
    infinite page fault loop when using HugeTLB pages implemented with
    contiguous PTEs when HAFDBS is not available. This happens because:
    
    1. The kernel may sometimes write PTEs that are sw-dirty but hw-clean
       (PTE_DIRTY | PTE_RDONLY | PTE_WRITE).
    
    2. If, during a write, the CPU uses a sw-dirty, hw-clean PTE in handling
       the memory access on a system without HAFDBS, we will get a page
       fault.
    
    3. HugeTLB will check if it needs to update the dirty bits on the PTE.
       For contiguous PTEs, it will check to see if the pgprot bits need
       updating. In this case, HugeTLB wants to write a sequence of
       sw-dirty, hw-dirty PTEs, but it finds that all the PTEs it is about
       to overwrite are all pte_dirty() (pte_sw_dirty() => pte_dirty()),
       so it thinks no update is necessary.
    
    We can get the kernel to write a sw-dirty, hw-clean PTE with the
    following steps (showing the relevant VMA flags and pgprot bits):
    
    i.   Create a valid, writable contiguous PTE.
           VMA vmflags:     VM_SHARED | VM_READ | VM_WRITE
           VMA pgprot bits: PTE_RDONLY | PTE_WRITE
           PTE pgprot bits: PTE_DIRTY | PTE_WRITE
    
    ii.  mprotect the VMA to PROT_NONE.
           VMA vmflags:     VM_SHARED
           VMA pgprot bits: PTE_RDONLY
           PTE pgprot bits: PTE_DIRTY | PTE_RDONLY
    
    iii. mprotect the VMA back to PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE.
           VMA vmflags:     VM_SHARED | VM_READ | VM_WRITE
           VMA pgprot bits: PTE_RDONLY | PTE_WRITE
           PTE pgprot bits: PTE_DIRTY | PTE_WRITE | PTE_RDONLY
    
    Make it impossible to create a writeable sw-dirty, hw-clean PTE with
    pte_modify(). Such a PTE should be impossible to create, and there may
    be places that assume that pte_dirty() implies pte_hw_dirty().

    ext4: prevent the normalized size from exceeding EXT_MAX_BLOCKS
    
    commit 2dcf5fde6dffb312a4bfb8ef940cea2d1f402e32 upstream.
    
    For files with logical blocks close to EXT_MAX_BLOCKS, the file size
    predicted in ext4_mb_normalize_request() may exceed EXT_MAX_BLOCKS.
    This can cause some blocks to be preallocated that will not be used.
    And after [Fixes], the following issue may be triggered:
    
    =========================================================
     kernel BUG at fs/ext4/mballoc.c:4653!
     Internal error: Oops - BUG: 00000000f2000800 [#1] SMP

      ext4_iomap_begin+0x1c0/0x348
    =========================================================
    
    Here is a calculation when adjusting ac_b_ex in ext4_mb_new_inode_pa():
    
            ex.fe_logical = orig_goal_end - EXT4_C2B(sbi, ex.fe_len);
            if (ac->ac_o_ex.fe_logical >= ex.fe_logical)
                    goto adjust_bex;
    
    The problem is that when orig_goal_end is subtracted from ac_b_ex.fe_len
    it is still greater than EXT_MAX_BLOCKS, which causes ex.fe_logical to
    overflow to a very small value, which ultimately triggers a BUG_ON in
    ext4_mb_new_inode_pa() because pa->pa_free < len.
    
    The last logical block of an actual write request does not exceed
    EXT_MAX_BLOCKS, so in ext4_mb_normalize_request() also avoids normalizing
    the last logical block to exceed EXT_MAX_BLOCKS to avoid the above issue.
    
    The test case in [Link] can reproduce the above issue with 64k block size.

    soundwire: stream: fix NULL pointer dereference for multi_link
    
    commit e199bf52ffda8f98f129728d57244a9cd9ad5623 upstream.
    
    If bus is marked as multi_link, but number of masters in the stream is
    not higher than bus->hw_sync_min_links (bus->multi_link && m_rt_count >=
    bus->hw_sync_min_links), bank switching should not happen.  The first
    part of do_bank_switch() code properly takes these conditions into
    account, but second part (sdw_ml_sync_bank_switch()) relies purely on
    bus->multi_link property.  This is not balanced and leads to NULL
    pointer dereference:
    
      Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000

    perf: Fix perf_event_validate_size() lockdep splat
    
    commit 7e2c1e4b34f07d9aa8937fab88359d4a0fce468e upstream.
    
    When lockdep is enabled, the for_each_sibling_event(sibling, event)
    macro checks that event->ctx->mutex is held. When creating a new group
    leader event, we call perf_event_validate_size() on a partially
    initialized event where event->ctx is NULL, and so when
    for_each_sibling_event() attempts to check event->ctx->mutex, we get a
    splat, as reported by Lucas De Marchi:
    
      WARNING: CPU: 8 PID: 1471 at kernel/events/core.c:1950 __do_sys_perf_event_open+0xf37/0x1080
    
    This only happens for a new event which is its own group_leader, and in
    this case there cannot be any sibling events. Thus it's safe to skip the
    check for siblings, which avoids having to make invasive and ugly
    changes to for_each_sibling_event().
    
    Avoid the splat by bailing out early when the new event is its own
    group_leader.

    asm-generic: qspinlock: fix queued_spin_value_unlocked() implementation
    
    [ Upstream commit 125b0bb95dd6bec81b806b997a4ccb026eeecf8f ]
    
    We really don't want to do atomic_read() or anything like that, since we
    already have the value, not the lock.  The whole point of this is that
    we've loaded the lock from memory, and we want to check whether the
    value we loaded was a locked one or not.
    
    The main use of this is the lockref code, which loads both the lock and
    the reference count in one atomic operation, and then works on that
    combined value.  With the atomic_read(), the compiler would pointlessly
    spill the value to the stack, in order to then be able to read it back
    "atomically".
    
    This is the qspinlock version of commit c6f4a9002252 ("asm-generic:
    ticket-lock: Optimize arch_spin_value_unlocked()") which fixed this same
    bug for ticket locks.

    HID: multitouch: Add quirk for HONOR GLO-GXXX touchpad
    
    [ Upstream commit 9ffccb691adb854e7b7f3ee57fbbda12ff70533f ]
    
    Honor MagicBook 13 2023 has a touchpad which do not switch to the multitouch
    mode until the input mode feature is written by the host.  The touchpad do
    report the input mode at touchpad(3), while itself working under mouse mode. As
    a workaround, it is possible to call MT_QUIRE_FORCE_GET_FEATURE to force set
    feature in mt_set_input_mode for such device.
    
    The touchpad reports as BLTP7853, which cannot retrive any useful manufacture
    information on the internel by this string at present.  As the serial number of
    the laptop is GLO-G52, while DMI info reports the laptop serial number as
    GLO-GXXX, this workaround should applied to all models which has the GLO-GXXX.

    HID: hid-asus: reset the backlight brightness level on resume
    
    [ Upstream commit 546edbd26cff7ae990e480a59150e801a06f77b1 ]
    
    Some devices managed by this driver automatically set brightness to 0
    before entering a suspended state and reset it back to a default
    brightness level after the resume:
    this has the effect of having the kernel report wrong brightness
    status after a sleep, and on some devices (like the Asus RC71L) that
    brightness is the intensity of LEDs directly facing the user.
    
    Fix the above issue by setting back brightness to the level it had
    before entering a sleep state.

    bcache: avoid NULL checking to c->root in run_cache_set()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3eba5e0b2422aec3c9e79822029599961fdcab97 ]
    
    In run_cache_set() after c->root returned from bch_btree_node_get(), it
    is checked by IS_ERR_OR_NULL(). Indeed it is unncessary to check NULL
    because bch_btree_node_get() will not return NULL pointer to caller.

    bcache: avoid oversize memory allocation by small stripe_size
    
    [ Upstream commit baf8fb7e0e5ec54ea0839f0c534f2cdcd79bea9c ]
    
    Arraies bcache->stripe_sectors_dirty and bcache->full_dirty_stripes are
    used for dirty data writeback, their sizes are decided by backing device
    capacity and stripe size. Larger backing device capacity or smaller
    stripe size make these two arraies occupies more dynamic memory space.
    
    Currently bcache->stripe_size is directly inherited from
    queue->limits.io_opt of underlying storage device. For normal hard
    drives, its limits.io_opt is 0, and bcache sets the corresponding
    stripe_size to 1TB (1<<31 sectors), it works fine 10+ years. But for
    devices do declare value for queue->limits.io_opt, small stripe_size
    (comparing to 1TB) becomes an issue for oversize memory allocations of
    bcache->stripe_sectors_dirty and bcache->full_dirty_stripes, while the
    capacity of hard drives gets much larger in recent decade.
    
    For example a raid5 array assembled by three 20TB hardrives, the raid
    device capacity is 40TB with typical 512KB limits.io_opt. After the math
    calculation in bcache code, these two arraies will occupy 400MB dynamic
    memory. Even worse Andrea Tomassetti reports that a 4KB limits.io_opt is
    declared on a new 2TB hard drive, then these two arraies request 2GB and
    512MB dynamic memory from kzalloc(). The result is that bcache device
    always fails to initialize on his system.
    
    To avoid the oversize memory allocation, bcache->stripe_size should not
    directly inherited by queue->limits.io_opt from the underlying device.
    This patch defines BCH_MIN_STRIPE_SZ (4MB) as minimal bcache stripe size
    and set bcache device's stripe size against the declared limits.io_opt
    value from the underlying storage device,
    - If the declared limits.io_opt > BCH_MIN_STRIPE_SZ, bcache device will
      set its stripe size directly by this limits.io_opt value.
    - If the declared limits.io_opt < BCH_MIN_STRIPE_SZ, bcache device will
      set its stripe size by a value multiplying limits.io_opt and euqal or
      large than BCH_MIN_STRIPE_SZ.
    
    Then the minimal stripe size of a bcache device will always be >= 4MB.
    For a 40TB raid5 device with 512KB limits.io_opt, memory occupied by
    bcache->stripe_sectors_dirty and bcache->full_dirty_stripes will be 50MB
    in total. For a 2TB hard drive with 4KB limits.io_opt, memory occupied
    by these two arraies will be 2.5MB in total.
    
    Such mount of memory allocated for bcache->stripe_sectors_dirty and
    bcache->full_dirty_stripes is reasonable for most of storage devices.

    usb: aqc111: check packet for fixup for true limit
    
    [ Upstream commit ccab434e674ca95d483788b1895a70c21b7f016a ]
    
    If a device sends a packet that is inbetween 0
    and sizeof(u64) the value passed to skb_trim()
    as length will wrap around ending up as some very
    large value.
    
    The driver will then proceed to parse the header
    located at that position, which will either oops or
    process some random value.
    
    The fix is to check against sizeof(u64) rather than
    0, which the driver currently does. The issue exists
    since the introduction of the driver.

    commit 5df12742b7e3aae2594a30a9d14d5d6e9e7699f4 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 40613da52b13fb21c5566f10b287e0ca8c12c4e9 and the
    subsequent fix to it:
    
      cc22522fd55e ("PCI: acpiphp: Use pci_assign_unassigned_bridge_resources() only for non-root bus")
    
    40613da52b13 fixed a problem where hot-adding a device with large BARs
    failed if the bridge windows programmed by firmware were not large enough.
    
    cc22522fd55e ("PCI: acpiphp: Use pci_assign_unassigned_bridge_resources()
    only for non-root bus") fixed a problem with 40613da52b13: an ACPI hot-add
    of a device on a PCI root bus (common in the virt world) or firmware
    sending ACPI Bus Check to non-existent Root Ports (e.g., on Dell Inspiron
    7352/0W6WV0) caused a NULL pointer dereference and suspend/resume hangs.
    
    Unfortunately the combination of 40613da52b13 and cc22522fd55e caused other
    problems:
    
      - Fiona reported that hot-add of SCSI disks in QEMU virtual machine fails
        sometimes.
    
      - Dongli reported a similar problem with hot-add of SCSI disks.
    
      - Jonathan reported a console freeze during boot on bare metal due to an
        error in radeon GPU initialization.
    
    Revert both patches to avoid adding these problems.  This means we will
    again see the problems with hot-adding devices with large BARs and the NULL
    pointer dereferences and suspend/resume issues that 40613da52b13 and
    cc22522fd55e were intended to fix.

    ALSA: hda/hdmi: add force-connect quirks for ASUSTeK Z170 variants
    
    commit 924f5ca2975b2993ee81a7ecc3c809943a70f334 upstream.
    
    On ASUSTeK Z170M PLUS and Z170 PRO GAMING systems, the display codec
    pins are not registered properly without the force-connect quirk. The
    codec will report only one pin as having external connectivity, but i915
    finds all three connectors on the system, so the two drivers are not
    in sync.
    
    Issue found with DRM igt-gpu-tools test kms_hdmi_inject@inject-audio.

    cred: switch to using atomic_long_t
    
    commit f8fa5d76925991976b3e7076f9d1052515ec1fca upstream.
    
    There are multiple ways to grab references to credentials, and the only
    protection we have against overflowing it is the memory required to do
    so.
    
    With memory sizes only moving in one direction, let's bump the reference
    count to 64-bit and move it outside the realm of feasibly overflowing.

    appletalk: Fix Use-After-Free in atalk_ioctl
    
    [ Upstream commit 189ff16722ee36ced4d2a2469d4ab65a8fee4198 ]
    
    Because atalk_ioctl() accesses sk->sk_receive_queue
    without holding a sk->sk_receive_queue.lock, it can
    cause a race with atalk_recvmsg().
    A use-after-free for skb occurs with the following flow.
    ```
    atalk_ioctl() -> skb_peek()
    atalk_recvmsg() -> skb_recv_datagram() -> skb_free_datagram()
    ```
    Add sk->sk_receive_queue.lock to atalk_ioctl() to fix this issue.

    [ Upstream commit e23c0d21ce9234fbc31ece35663ababbb83f9347 ]
    
    Many hardware configurations have the MDIO bus disabled, and are instead
    using some other MDIO bus to talk to the MAC's phy.
    
    of_mdiobus_register() returns -ENODEV in this case. Let's handle it
    gracefully instead of failing to probe the MAC.

    net: stmmac: use dev_err_probe() for reporting mdio bus registration failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 839612d23ffd933174db911ce56dc3f3ca883ec5 ]
    
    I have a board where these two lines are always printed during boot:
    
       imx-dwmac 30bf0000.ethernet: Cannot register the MDIO bus
       imx-dwmac 30bf0000.ethernet: stmmac_dvr_probe: MDIO bus (id: 1) registration failed
    
    It's perfectly fine, and the device is successfully (and silently, as
    far as the console goes) probed later.
    
    Use dev_err_probe() instead, which will demote these messages to debug
    level (thus removing the alarming messages from the console) when the
    error is -EPROBE_DEFER, and also has the advantage of including the
    error code if/when it happens to be something other than -EPROBE_DEFER.
    
    While here, add the missing \n to one of the format strings.

      // TCP B: not send challenge ack for ack limit or packet loss
      // TCP A: close
            tcp_close

                ip_fragment
                    icmp_glue_bits //BUG_ON
    
    If we use tcp_trim_head() to remove acked SYN from packet that contains data
    or other flags, skb->len will be incorrectly decremented. We can remove SYN
    flag that has been acked from rtx_queue earlier than tcp_trim_head(), which
    can fix the problem mentioned above.

    qca_spi: Fix reset behavior
    
    [ Upstream commit 1057812d146dd658c9a9a96d869c2551150207b5 ]
    
    In case of a reset triggered by the QCA7000 itself, the behavior of the
    qca_spi driver was not quite correct:
    - in case of a pending RX frame decoding the drop counter must be
      incremented and decoding state machine reseted
    - also the reset counter must always be incremented regardless of sync
      state

    qca_debug: Fix ethtool -G iface tx behavior
    
    [ Upstream commit 96a7e861d9e04d07febd3011c30cd84cd141d81f ]
    
    After calling ethtool -g it was not possible to adjust the TX ring
    size again:
    
      # ethtool -g eth1
      Ring parameters for eth1:
      Pre-set maximums:
      RX:           4
      RX Mini:      n/a
      RX Jumbo:     n/a
      TX:           10
      Current hardware settings:
      RX:           4
      RX Mini:      n/a
      RX Jumbo:     n/a
      TX:           10
      # ethtool -G eth1 tx 8
      netlink error: Invalid argument
    
    The reason for this is that the readonly setting rx_pending get
    initialized and after that the range check in qcaspi_set_ringparam()
    fails regardless of the provided parameter. So fix this by accepting
    the exposed RX defaults. Instead of adding another magic number
    better use a new define here.

    qca_debug: Prevent crash on TX ring changes
    
    [ Upstream commit f4e6064c97c050bd9904925ff7d53d0c9954fc7b ]
    
    The qca_spi driver stop and restart the SPI kernel thread
    (via ndo_stop & ndo_open) in case of TX ring changes. This is
    a big issue because it allows userspace to prevent restart of
    the SPI kernel thread (via signals). A subsequent change of
    TX ring wrongly assume a valid spi_thread pointer which result
    in a crash.
    
    So prevent this by stopping the network traffic handling and
    temporary park the SPI thread.

    net: ipv6: support reporting otherwise unknown prefix flags in RTM_NEWPREFIX
    
    [ Upstream commit bd4a816752bab609dd6d65ae021387beb9e2ddbd ]
    
    Lorenzo points out that we effectively clear all unknown
    flags from PIO when copying them to userspace in the netlink
    RTM_NEWPREFIX notification.
    
    We could fix this one at a time as new flags are defined,
    or in one fell swoop - I choose the latter.
    
    We could either define 6 new reserved flags (reserved1..6) and handle
    them individually (and rename them as new flags are defined), or we
    could simply copy the entire unmodified byte over - I choose the latter.
    
    This unfortunately requires some anonymous union/struct magic,
    so we add a static assert on the struct size for a little extra safety.

    afs: Fix refcount underflow from error handling race
    
    [ Upstream commit 52bf9f6c09fca8c74388cd41cc24e5d1bff812a9 ]
    
    If an AFS cell that has an unreachable (eg. ENETUNREACH) server listed (VL
    server or fileserver), an asynchronous probe to one of its addresses may
    fail immediately because sendmsg() returns an error.  When this happens, a
    refcount underflow can happen if certain events hit a very small window.
    
    The way this occurs is:
    
     (1) There are two levels of "call" object, the afs_call and the
         rxrpc_call.  Each of them can be transitioned to a "completed" state
         in the event of success or failure.
    
     (2) Asynchronous afs_calls are self-referential whilst they are active to
         prevent them from evaporating when they're not being processed.  This
         reference is disposed of when the afs_call is completed.
    
         Note that an afs_call may only be completed once; once completed
         completing it again will do nothing.
    
     (3) When a call transmission is made, the app-side rxrpc code queues a Tx
         buffer for the rxrpc I/O thread to transmit.  The I/O thread invokes
         sendmsg() to transmit it - and in the case of failure, it transitions
         the rxrpc_call to the completed state.
    
     (4) When an rxrpc_call is completed, the app layer is notified.  In this
         case, the app is kafs and it schedules a work item to process events
         pertaining to an afs_call.
    
     (5) When the afs_call event processor is run, it goes down through the
         RPC-specific handler to afs_extract_data() to retrieve data from rxrpc
         - and, in this case, it picks up the error from the rxrpc_call and
         returns it.
    
         The error is then propagated to the afs_call and that is completed
         too.  At this point the self-reference is released.
    
     (6) If the rxrpc I/O thread manages to complete the rxrpc_call within the
         window between rxrpc_send_data() queuing the request packet and
         checking for call completion on the way out, then
         rxrpc_kernel_send_data() will return the error from sendmsg() to the
         app.
    
     (7) Then afs_make_call() will see an error and will jump to the error
         handling path which will attempt to clean up the afs_call.
    
     (8) The problem comes when the error handling path in afs_make_call()
         tries to unconditionally drop an async afs_call's self-reference.
         This self-reference, however, may already have been dropped by
         afs_extract_data() completing the afs_call
    
     (9) The refcount underflows when we return to afs_do_probe_vlserver() and
         that tries to drop its reference on the afs_call.
    
    Fix this by making afs_make_call() attempt to complete the afs_call rather
    than unconditionally putting it.  That way, if afs_extract_data() manages
    to complete the call first, afs_make_call() won't do anything.
    
    The bug can be forced by making do_udp_sendmsg() return -ENETUNREACH and
    sticking an msleep() in rxrpc_send_data() after the 'success:' label to
    widen the race window.
    
    The error message looks something like:
    
        refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.
