    drm/edid: fix objtool warning in drm_cvt_modes()
    
    commit d652d5f1eeeb06046009f4fcb9b4542249526916 upstream.
    
    Commit 991fcb77f490 ("drm/edid: Fix uninitialized variable in
    drm_cvt_modes()") just replaced one warning with another.
    
    The original warning about a possibly uninitialized variable was due to
    the compiler not being smart enough to see that the case statement
    actually enumerated all possible cases.  And the initial fix was just to
    add a "default" case that had a single "unreachable()", just to tell the
    compiler that that situation cannot happen.
    
    However, that doesn't actually fix the fundamental reason for the
    problem: the compiler still doesn't see that the existing case
    statements enumerate all possibilities, so the compiler will still
    generate code to jump to that unreachable case statement.  It just won't
    complain about an uninitialized variable any more.
    
    So now the compiler generates code to our inline asm marker that we told
    it would not fall through, and end end result is basically random.  We
    have created a bridge to nowhere.
    
    And then, depending on the random details of just exactly what the
    compiler ends up doing, 'objtool' might end up complaining about the
    conditional branches (for conditions that cannot happen, and that thus
    will never be taken - but if the compiler was not smart enough to figure
    that out, we can't expect objtool to do so) going off in the weeds.
    
    So depending on how the compiler has laid out the result, you might see
    something like this:
    
        drivers/gpu/drm/drm_edid.o: warning: objtool: do_cvt_mode() falls through to next function drm_mode_detailed.isra.0()
    
    and now you have a truly inscrutable warning that makes no sense at all
    unless you start looking at whatever random code the compiler happened
    to generate for our bare "unreachable()" statement.
    
    IOW, don't use "unreachable()" unless you have an _active_ operation
    that generates code that actually makes it obvious that something is not
    reachable (ie an UD instruction or similar).
    
    Solve the "compiler isn't smart enough" problem by just marking one of
    the cases as "default", so that even when the compiler doesn't otherwise
    see that we've enumerated all cases, the compiler will feel happy and
    safe about there always being a valid case that initializes the 'width'
    variable.
    
    This also generates better code, since now the compiler doesn't generate
    comparisons for five different possibilities (the four real ones and the
    one that can't happen), but just for the three real ones and "the rest"
    (which is that last one).
    
    A smart enough compiler that sees that we cover all the cases won't care.

    [ Upstream commit 8527beb12087238d4387607597b4020bc393c4b4 ]
    
    The decision whether to enable a wake irq during suspend can not be done
    based on the runtime PM state directly as a driver may use wake irqs
    without implementing runtime PM. Such drivers specifically leave the
    state set to the default 'suspended' and the wake irq is thus never
    enabled at suspend.
    
    Add a new wake irq flag to track whether a dedicated wake irq has been
    enabled at runtime suspend and therefore must not be enabled at system
    suspend.
    
    Note that pm_runtime_enabled() can not be used as runtime PM is always
    disabled during late suspend.

    PM / wakeirq: support enabling wake-up irq after runtime_suspend called
    
    [ Upstream commit 259714100d98b50bf04d36a21bf50ca8b829fc11 ]
    
    When the dedicated wake IRQ is level trigger, and it uses the
    device's low-power status as the wakeup source, that means if the
    device is not in low-power state, the wake IRQ will be triggered
    if enabled; For this case, need enable the wake IRQ after running
    the device's ->runtime_suspend() which make it enter low-power state.
    
    e.g.
    Assume the wake IRQ is a low level trigger type, and the wakeup
    signal comes from the low-power status of the device.
    The wakeup signal is low level at running time (0), and becomes
    high level when the device enters low-power state (runtime_suspend
    (1) is called), a wakeup event at (2) make the device exit low-power
    state, then the wakeup signal also becomes low level.
    
                    ------------------
                   |           ^     ^|
    ----------------           |     | --------------
     |<---(0)--->|<--(1)--|   (3)   (2)    (4)
    
    if enable the wake IRQ before running runtime_suspend during (0),
    a wake IRQ will arise, it causes resume immediately;
    it works if enable wake IRQ ( e.g. at (3) or (4)) after running
    ->runtime_suspend().
    
    This patch introduces a new status WAKE_IRQ_DEDICATED_REVERSE to
    optionally support enabling wake IRQ after running ->runtime_suspend().

    test_firmware: return ENOMEM instead of ENOSPC on failed memory allocation
    
    commit 7dae593cd226a0bca61201cf85ceb9335cf63682 upstream.
    
    In a couple of situations like
    
            name = kstrndup(buf, count, GFP_KERNEL);
            if (!name)
                    return -ENOSPC;
    
    the error is not actually "No space left on device", but "Out of memory".
    
    It is semantically correct to return -ENOMEM in all failed kstrndup()
    and kzalloc() cases in this driver, as it is not a problem with disk
    space, but with kernel memory allocator failing allocation.
    
    The semantically correct should be:
    
            name = kstrndup(buf, count, GFP_KERNEL);
            if (!name)
                    return -ENOMEM;

    test_firmware: fix a memory leak with reqs buffer
    
    commit be37bed754ed90b2655382f93f9724b3c1aae847 upstream.
    
    Dan Carpenter spotted that test_fw_config->reqs will be leaked if
    trigger_batched_requests_store() is called two or more times.
    The same appears with trigger_batched_requests_async_store().
    
    This bug wasn't trigger by the tests, but observed by Dan's visual
    inspection of the code.
    
    The recommended workaround was to return -EBUSY if test_fw_config->reqs
    is already allocated.

    Ext2 has fields in superblock reserved for subblock allocation support.
    However that never landed. Drop the many years dead code.

    Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix use-after-free in l2cap_sock_ready_cb
    
    commit 1728137b33c00d5a2b5110ed7aafb42e7c32e4a1 upstream.
    
    l2cap_sock_release(sk) frees sk. However, sk's children are still alive
    and point to the already free'd sk's address.
    To fix this, l2cap_sock_release(sk) also cleans sk's children.

    libceph: fix potential hang in ceph_osdc_notify()
    
    commit e6e2843230799230fc5deb8279728a7218b0d63c upstream.
    
    If the cluster becomes unavailable, ceph_osdc_notify() may hang even
    with osd_request_timeout option set because linger_notify_finish_wait()
    waits for MWatchNotify NOTIFY_COMPLETE message with no associated OSD
    request in flight -- it's completely asynchronous.
    
    Introduce an additional timeout, derived from the specified notify
    timeout.  While at it, switch both waits to killable which is more
    correct.

    scsi: zfcp: Defer fc_rport blocking until after ADISC response
    
    commit e65851989001c0c9ba9177564b13b38201c0854c upstream.
    
    Storage devices are free to send RSCNs, e.g. for internal state changes. If
    this happens on all connected paths, zfcp risks temporarily losing all
    paths at the same time. This has strong requirements on multipath
    configuration such as "no_path_retry queue".
    
    Avoid such situations by deferring fc_rport blocking until after the ADISC
    response, when any actual state change of the remote port became clear.
    The already existing port recovery triggers explicitly block the fc_rport.
    The triggers are: on ADISC reject or timeout (typical cable pull case), and
    on ADISC indicating that the remote port has changed its WWPN or
    the port is meanwhile no longer open.
    
    As a side effect, this also removes a confusing direct function call to
    another work item function zfcp_scsi_rport_work() instead of scheduling
    that other work item. It was probably done that way to have the rport block
    side effect immediate and synchronous to the caller.

    tcp_metrics: fix data-race in tcpm_suck_dst() vs fastopen
    
    [ Upstream commit ddf251fa2bc1d3699eec0bae6ed0bc373b8fda79 ]
    
    Whenever tcpm_new() reclaims an old entry, tcpm_suck_dst()
    would overwrite data that could be read from tcp_fastopen_cache_get()
    or tcp_metrics_fill_info().
    
    We need to acquire fastopen_seqlock to maintain consistency.
    
    For newly allocated objects, tcpm_new() can switch to kzalloc()
    to avoid an extra fastopen_seqlock acquisition.

    net: sched: cls_u32: Fix match key mis-addressing
    
    [ Upstream commit e68409db995380d1badacba41ff24996bd396171 ]
    
    A match entry is uniquely identified with an "address" or "path" in the
    form of: hashtable ID(12b):bucketid(8b):nodeid(12b).
    
    When creating table match entries all of hash table id, bucket id and
    node (match entry id) are needed to be either specified by the user or
    reasonable in-kernel defaults are used. The in-kernel default for a table id is
    0x800(omnipresent root table); for bucketid it is 0x0. Prior to this fix there
    was none for a nodeid i.e. the code assumed that the user passed the correct
    nodeid and if the user passes a nodeid of 0 (as Mingi Cho did) then that is what
    was used. But nodeid of 0 is reserved for identifying the table. This is not
    a problem until we dump. The dump code notices that the nodeid is zero and
    assumes it is referencing a table and therefore references table struct
    tc_u_hnode instead of what was created i.e match entry struct tc_u_knode.
    
    Ming does an equivalent of:
    tc filter add dev dummy0 parent 10: prio 1 handle 0x1000 \
    protocol ip u32 match ip src 10.0.0.1/32 classid 10:1 action ok
    
    Essentially specifying a table id 0, bucketid 1 and nodeid of zero
    Tableid 0 is remapped to the default of 0x800.
    Bucketid 1 is ignored and defaults to 0x00.
    Nodeid was assumed to be what Ming passed - 0x000
    
    dumping before fix shows:
    ~$ tc filter ls dev dummy0 parent 10:
    filter protocol ip pref 1 u32 chain 0
    filter protocol ip pref 1 u32 chain 0 fh 800: ht divisor 1
    filter protocol ip pref 1 u32 chain 0 fh 800: ht divisor -30591
    
    Note that the last line reports a table instead of a match entry
    (you can tell this because it says "ht divisor...").
    As a result of reporting the wrong data type (misinterpretting of struct
    tc_u_knode as being struct tc_u_hnode) the divisor is reported with value
    of -30591. Ming identified this as part of the heap address
    (physmap_base is 0xffff8880 (-30591 - 1)).
    
    The fix is to ensure that when table entry matches are added and no
    nodeid is specified (i.e nodeid == 0) then we get the next available
    nodeid from the table's pool.
    
    After the fix, this is what the dump shows:
    $ tc filter ls dev dummy0 parent 10:
    filter protocol ip pref 1 u32 chain 0

    [ Upstream commit 0c02cc576eac161601927b41634f80bfd55bfa9e ]
    
    Commit 9fb6c9b3fea1 ("s390/sthyi: add cache to store hypervisor info")
    added cache handling for store hypervisor info. This also changed the
    possible return code for sthyi_fill().
    
    Instead of only returning a condition code like the sthyi instruction would
    do, it can now also return a negative error value (-ENOMEM). handle_styhi()
    was not changed accordingly. In case of an error, the negative error value
    would incorrectly injected into the guest PSW.
    
    Add proper error handling to prevent this, and update the comment which
    describes the possible return values of sthyi_fill().

    word-at-a-time: use the same return type for has_zero regardless of endianness
    
    [ Upstream commit 79e8328e5acbe691bbde029a52c89d70dcbc22f3 ]
    
    Compiling big-endian targets with Clang produces the diagnostic:
    
      fs/namei.c:2173:13: warning: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands [-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]
            } while (!(has_zero(a, &adata, &constants) | has_zero(b, &bdata, &constants)));
                      ~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                                   ||
      fs/namei.c:2173:13: note: cast one or both operands to int to silence this warning
    
    It appears that when has_zero was introduced, two definitions were
    produced with different signatures (in particular different return
    types).
    
    Looking at the usage in hash_name() in fs/namei.c, I suspect that
    has_zero() is meant to be invoked twice per while loop iteration; using
    logical-or would not update `bdata` when `a` did not have zeros.  So I
    think it's preferred to always return an unsigned long rather than a
    bool than update the while loop in hash_name() to use a logical-or
    rather than bitwise-or.

    loop: Select I/O scheduler 'none' from inside add_disk()
    
    commit 2112f5c1330a671fa852051d85cb9eadc05d7eb7 upstream.
    
    We noticed that the user interface of Android devices becomes very slow
    under memory pressure. This is because Android uses the zram driver on top
    of the loop driver for swapping, because under memory pressure the swap
    code alternates reads and writes quickly, because mq-deadline is the
    default scheduler for loop devices and because mq-deadline delays writes by
    five seconds for such a workload with default settings. Fix this by making
    the kernel select I/O scheduler 'none' from inside add_disk() for loop
    devices. This default can be overridden at any time from user space,
    e.g. via a udev rule. This approach has an advantage compared to changing
    the I/O scheduler from userspace from 'mq-deadline' into 'none', namely
    that synchronize_rcu() does not get called.
    
    This patch changes the default I/O scheduler for loop devices from
    'mq-deadline' into 'none'.
    
    Additionally, this patch reduces the Android boot time on my test setup
    with 0.5 seconds compared to configuring the loop I/O scheduler from user
    space.

    net/sched: cls_u32: Fix reference counter leak leading to overflow
    
    commit 04c55383fa5689357bcdd2c8036725a55ed632bc upstream.
    
    In the event of a failure in tcf_change_indev(), u32_set_parms() will
    immediately return without decrementing the recently incremented
    reference counter.  If this happens enough times, the counter will
    rollover and the reference freed, leading to a double free which can be
    used to do 'bad things'.
    
    In order to prevent this, move the point of possible failure above the
    point where the reference counter is incremented.  Also save any
    meaningful return values to be applied to the return data at the
    appropriate point in time.
    
    This issue was caught with KASAN.

    ASoC: cs42l51: fix driver to properly autoload with automatic module loading
    
    commit e51df4f81b02bcdd828a04de7c1eb6a92988b61e upstream.
    
    In commit 2cb1e0259f50 ("ASoC: cs42l51: re-hook of_match_table
    pointer"), 9 years ago, some random guy fixed the cs42l51 after it was
    split into a core part and an I2C part to properly match based on a
    Device Tree compatible string.
    
    However, the fix in this commit is wrong: the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(of,
    ....) is in the core part of the driver, not the I2C part. Therefore,
    automatic module loading based on module.alias, based on matching with
    the DT compatible string, loads the core part of the driver, but not
    the I2C part. And threfore, the i2c_driver is not registered, and the
    codec is not known to the system, nor matched with a DT node with the
    corresponding compatible string.
    
    In order to fix that, we move the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(of, ...) into
    the I2C part of the driver. The cs42l51_of_match[] array is also moved
    as well, as it is not possible to have this definition in one file,
    and the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(of, ...) invocation in another file, due
    to how MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE works.
    
    Thanks to this commit, the I2C part of the driver now properly
    autoloads, and thanks to its dependency on the core part, the core
    part gets autoloaded as well, resulting in a functional sound card
    without having to manually load kernel modules.

    net/sched: sch_qfq: account for stab overhead in qfq_enqueue
    
    commit 3e337087c3b5805fe0b8a46ba622a962880b5d64 upstream.
    
    Lion says:
    -------
    In the QFQ scheduler a similar issue to CVE-2023-31436
    persists.
    
    Consider the following code in net/sched/sch_qfq.c:
    
    static int qfq_enqueue(struct sk_buff *skb, struct Qdisc *sch,
                    struct sk_buff **to_free)
    {
         unsigned int len = qdisc_pkt_len(skb), gso_segs;
    
        // ...
    
         if (unlikely(cl->agg->lmax < len)) {
             pr_debug("qfq: increasing maxpkt from %u to %u for class %u",
                  cl->agg->lmax, len, cl->common.classid);
             err = qfq_change_agg(sch, cl, cl->agg->class_weight, len);
             if (err) {
                 cl->qstats.drops++;
                 return qdisc_drop(skb, sch, to_free);
             }
    
        // ...
    
         }
    
    Similarly to CVE-2023-31436, "lmax" is increased without any bounds
    checks according to the packet length "len". Usually this would not
    impose a problem because packet sizes are naturally limited.
    
    This is however not the actual packet length, rather the
    "qdisc_pkt_len(skb)" which might apply size transformations according to
    "struct qdisc_size_table" as created by "qdisc_get_stab()" in
    net/sched/sch_api.c if the TCA_STAB option was set when modifying the qdisc.
    
    A user may choose virtually any size using such a table.
    
    As a result the same issue as in CVE-2023-31436 can occur, allowing heap
    out-of-bounds read / writes in the kmalloc-8192 cache.
    -------
    
    We can create the issue with the following commands:
    
    tc qdisc add dev $DEV root handle 1: stab mtu 2048 tsize 512 mpu 0 \
    overhead 999999999 linklayer ethernet qfq
    tc class add dev $DEV parent 1: classid 1:1 htb rate 6mbit burst 15k
    tc filter add dev $DEV parent 1: matchall classid 1:1
    ping -I $DEV 1.1.1.2
    
    This is caused by incorrectly assuming that qdisc_pkt_len() returns a
    length within the QFQ_MIN_LMAX < len < QFQ_MAX_LMAX.

    commit 0323bce598eea038714f941ce2b22541c46d488f upstream.
    
    In the event of a failure in tcf_change_indev(), fw_set_parms() will
    immediately return an error after incrementing or decrementing
    reference counter in tcf_bind_filter().  If attacker can control
    reference counter to zero and make reference freed, leading to
    use after free.
    
    In order to prevent this, move the point of possible failure above the
    point where the TC_FW_CLASSID is handled.

    commit 1e4ab7b4c881cf26c1c72b3f56519e03475486fb upstream.
    
    When using the cleaner policy to decommission the cache, there is
    never any writeback started from the cache as it is constantly delayed
    due to normal I/O keeping the device busy. Meaning @idle=false was
    always being passed to clean_target_met()
    
    Fix this by adding a specific 'cleaner' flag that is set when the
    cleaner policy is configured. This flag serves to always allow the
    cleaner's writeback work to be queued until the cache is
    decommissioned (even if the cache isn't idle).

    commit f061e2be8689057cb4ec0dbffa9f03e1a23cdcb2 upstream.
    
    The WM8904_ADC_TEST_0 register is modified as part of updating the OSR
    controls but does not have a cache default, leading to errors when we try
    to modify these controls in cache only mode with no prior read:
    
    wm8904 3-001a: ASoC: error at snd_soc_component_update_bits on wm8904.3-001a for register: [0x000000c6] -16
    
    Add a read of the register to probe() to fill the cache and avoid both the
    error messages and the misconfiguration of the chip which will result.

    s390/dasd: fix hanging device after quiesce/resume
    
    commit 05f1d8ed03f547054efbc4d29bb7991c958ede95 upstream.
    
    Quiesce and resume are functions that tell the DASD driver to stop/resume
    issuing I/Os to a specific DASD.
    
    On resume dasd_schedule_block_bh() is called to kick handling of IO
    requests again. This does unfortunately not cover internal requests which
    are used for path verification for example.
    
    This could lead to a hanging device when a path event or anything else
    that triggers internal requests occurs on a quiesced device.
    
    Fix by also calling dasd_schedule_device_bh() which triggers handling of
    internal requests on resume.

    A race were found where set_channels could be called after registering
    but before virtnet_set_queues() in virtnet_probe(). Fixing this by
    moving the virtnet_set_queues() before netdevice registering. While at

    irq-bcm6345-l1: Do not assume a fixed block to cpu mapping
    
    [ Upstream commit 55ad24857341c36616ecc1d9580af5626c226cf1 ]
    
    The irq to block mapping is fixed, and interrupts from the first block
    will always be routed to the first parent IRQ. But the parent interrupts
    themselves can be routed to any available CPU.
    
    This is used by the bootloader to map the first parent interrupt to the
    boot CPU, regardless wether the boot CPU is the first one or the second
    one.
    
    When booting from the second CPU, the assumption that the first block's
    IRQ is mapped to the first CPU breaks, and the system hangs because
    interrupts do not get routed correctly.
    
    Fix this by passing the appropriate bcm6434_l1_cpu to the interrupt
    handler instead of the chip itself, so the handler always has the right
    block.

    tpm_tis: Explicitly check for error code
    
    commit 513253f8c293c0c8bd46d09d337fc892bf8f9f48 upstream.
    
    recv_data either returns the number of received bytes, or a negative value
    representing an error code. Adding the return value directly to the total
    number of received bytes therefore looks a little weird, since it might add
    a negative error code to a sum of bytes.
    
    The following check for size < expected usually makes the function return
    ETIME in that case, so it does not cause too many problems in practice. But
    to make the code look cleaner and because the caller might still be
    interested in the original error code, explicitly check for the presence of
    an error code and pass that through.

    btrfs: check for commit error at btrfs_attach_transaction_barrier()
    
    commit b28ff3a7d7e97456fd86b68d24caa32e1cfa7064 upstream.
    
    btrfs_attach_transaction_barrier() is used to get a handle pointing to the
    current running transaction if the transaction has not started its commit
    yet (its state is < TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START). If the transaction commit
    has started, then we wait for the transaction to commit and finish before
    returning - however we completely ignore if the transaction was aborted
    due to some error during its commit, we simply return ERR_PT(-ENOENT),
    which makes the caller assume everything is fine and no errors happened.
    
    This could make an fsync return success (0) to user space when in fact we
    had a transaction abort and the target inode changes were therefore not
    persisted.
    
    Fix this by checking for the return value from btrfs_wait_for_commit(),
    and if it returned an error, return it back to the caller.

    USB: quirks: add quirk for Focusrite Scarlett
    
    commit 9dc162e22387080e2d06de708b89920c0e158c9a upstream.
    
    The Focusrite Scarlett audio device does not behave correctly during
    resumes. Below is what happens during every resume (captured with
    Beagle 5000):
    
    <Suspend>
    <Resume>
    <Reset>/<Chirp J>/<Tiny J>
    <Reset/Target disconnected>
    <High Speed>
    
    The Scarlett disconnects and is enumerated again.
    
    However from time to time it drops completely off the USB bus during
    resume. Below is captured occurrence of such an event:
    
    <Suspend>
    <Resume>
    <Reset>/<Chirp J>/<Tiny J>
    <Reset>/<Chirp K>/<Tiny K>
    <High Speed>
    <Corrupted packet>
    <Reset/Target disconnected>
    
    To fix the condition a user has to unplug and plug the device again.
    
    With USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME applied ("usbcore.quirks=1235:8211:b")
    for the Scarlett audio device the issue still reproduces.
    
    Applying USB_QUIRK_DISCONNECT_SUSPEND ("usbcore.quirks=1235:8211:m")
    fixed the issue and the Scarlett audio device didn't drop off the USB
    bus for ~5000 suspend/resume cycles where originally issue reproduced in
    ~100 or less suspend/resume cycles.

    commit b32b8f2b9542d8039f5468303a6ca78c1b5611a5 upstream.
    
    Hardware based on the Bay Trail / BYT SoCs require an external ULPI phy for
    USB device-mode. The phy chip usually has its 'reset' and 'chip select'
    lines connected to GPIOs described by ACPI fwnodes in the DSDT table.
    
    Because of hardware with missing ACPI resources for the 'reset' and 'chip
    select' GPIOs commit 5741022cbdf3 ("usb: dwc3: pci: Add GPIO lookup table
    on platforms without ACPI GPIO resources") introduced a fallback
    gpiod_lookup_table with hard-coded mappings for Bay Trail devices.
    
    However there are existing Bay Trail based devices, like the National
    Instruments cRIO-903x series, where the phy chip has its 'reset' and
    'chip-select' lines always asserted in hardware via resistor pull-ups. On
    this hardware the phy chip is always enabled and the ACPI dsdt table is
    missing information not only for the 'chip-select' and 'reset' lines but
    also for the BYT GPIO controller itself "INT33FC".
    
    With the introduction of the gpiod_lookup_table initializing the USB
    device-mode on these hardware now errors out. The error comes from the
    gpiod_get_optional() calls in dwc3_pci_quirks() which will now return an
    -ENOENT error due to the missing ACPI entry for the INT33FC gpio controller
    used in the aforementioned table.
    
    This hardware used to work before because gpiod_get_optional() will return
    NULL instead of -ENOENT if no GPIO has been assigned to the requested
    function. The dwc3_pci_quirks() code for setting the 'cs' and 'reset' GPIOs
    was then skipped (due to the NULL return). This is the correct behavior in
    cases where the phy chip is hardwired and there are no GPIOs to control.
    
    Since the gpiod_lookup_table relies on the presence of INT33FC fwnode
    in ACPI tables only add the table if we know the entry for the INT33FC
    gpio controller is present. This allows Bay Trail based devices with
    hardwired dwc3 ULPI phys to continue working.

    Revert "usb: dwc3: core: Enable AutoRetry feature in the controller"
    
    commit 734ae15ab95a18d3d425fc9cb38b7a627d786f08 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit b138e23d3dff90c0494925b4c1874227b81bddf7.
    
    AutoRetry has been found to sometimes cause controller freezes when
    communicating with buggy USB devices.
    
    This controller feature allows the controller in host mode to send
    non-terminating/burst retry ACKs instead of terminating retry ACKs
    to devices when a transaction error (CRC error or overflow) occurs.
    
    Unfortunately, if the USB device continues to respond with a CRC error,
    the controller will not complete endpoint-related commands while it
    keeps trying to auto-retry. [3] The xHCI driver will notice this once
    it tries to abort the transfer using a Stop Endpoint command and
    does not receive a completion in time. [1]
    This situation is reported to dmesg:
    
    [sda] tag#29 uas_eh_abort_handler 0 uas-tag 1 inflight: CMD IN
    [sda] tag#29 CDB: opcode=0x28 28 00 00 69 42 80 00 00 48 00
    xhci-hcd: xHCI host not responding to stop endpoint command
    xhci-hcd: xHCI host controller not responding, assume dead
    xhci-hcd: HC died; cleaning up
    
    Some users observed this problem on an Odroid HC2 with the JMS578
    USB3-to-SATA bridge. The issue can be triggered by starting
    a read-heavy workload on an attached SSD. After a while, the host
    controller would die and the SSD would disappear from the system. [1]
    
    Further analysis by Synopsys determined that controller revisions
    other than the one in Odroid HC2 are also affected by this.
    The recommended solution was to disable AutoRetry altogether.
    This change does not have a noticeable performance impact. [2]
    
    Revert the enablement commit. This will keep the AutoRetry bit in
    the default state configured during SoC design [2].

    can: gs_usb: gs_can_close(): add missing set of CAN state to CAN_STATE_STOPPED
    
    commit f8a2da6ec2417cca169fa85a8ab15817bccbb109 upstream.
    
    After an initial link up the CAN device is in ERROR-ACTIVE mode. Due
    to a missing CAN_STATE_STOPPED in gs_can_close() it doesn't change to
    STOPPED after a link down:

    |     link/can  promiscuity 0 allmulti 0 minmtu 0 maxmtu 0
    |     can state ERROR-ACTIVE restart-ms 1000
    
    Add missing assignment of CAN_STATE_STOPPED in gs_can_close().

    tracing: Fix warning in trace_buffered_event_disable()
    
    [ Upstream commit dea499781a1150d285c62b26659f62fb00824fce ]
    
    Warning happened in trace_buffered_event_disable() at
      WARN_ON_ONCE(!trace_buffered_event_ref)
    
      Call Trace:
       ? __warn+0xa5/0x1b0

       vfs_write+0x1c9/0x6f0
       [...]
    
    The cause of the warning is in __ftrace_event_enable_disable(),
    trace_buffered_event_enable() was called once while
    trace_buffered_event_disable() was called twice.
    Reproduction script show as below, for analysis, see the comments:
     ```
     #!/bin/bash
    
     cd /sys/kernel/tracing/
    
     # 1. Register a 'disable_event' command, then:
     #    1) SOFT_DISABLED_BIT was set;
     #    2) trace_buffered_event_enable() was called first time;
     echo 'cmdline_proc_show:disable_event:initcall:initcall_finish' > \
         set_ftrace_filter
    
     # 2. Enable the event registered, then:
     #    1) SOFT_DISABLED_BIT was cleared;
     #    2) trace_buffered_event_disable() was called first time;
     echo 1 > events/initcall/initcall_finish/enable
    
     # 3. Try to call into cmdline_proc_show(), then SOFT_DISABLED_BIT was
     #    set again!!!
     cat /proc/cmdline
    
     # 4. Unregister the 'disable_event' command, then:
     #    1) SOFT_DISABLED_BIT was cleared again;
     #    2) trace_buffered_event_disable() was called second time!!!
     echo '!cmdline_proc_show:disable_event:initcall:initcall_finish' > \
         set_ftrace_filter
     ```
    
    To fix it, IIUC, we can change to call trace_buffered_event_enable() at
    fist time soft-mode enabled, and call trace_buffered_event_disable() at
    last time soft-mode disabled.

    ring-buffer: Fix wrong stat of cpu_buffer->read
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d093282b0d4357373497f65db6a05eb0c28b7c8 ]
    
    When pages are removed in rb_remove_pages(), 'cpu_buffer->read' is set
    to 0 in order to make sure any read iterators reset themselves. However,
    this will mess 'entries' stating, see following steps:
    
      # cd /sys/kernel/tracing/
      # 1. Enlarge ring buffer prepare for later reducing:
      # echo 20 > per_cpu/cpu0/buffer_size_kb
      # 2. Write a log into ring buffer of cpu0:
      # taskset -c 0 echo "hello1" > trace_marker
      # 3. Read the log:
      # cat per_cpu/cpu0/trace_pipe
           <...>-332     [000] .....    62.406844: tracing_mark_write: hello1
      # 4. Stop reading and see the stats, now 0 entries, and 1 event readed:
      # cat per_cpu/cpu0/stats
       entries: 0
       [...]
       read events: 1
      # 5. Reduce the ring buffer
      # echo 7 > per_cpu/cpu0/buffer_size_kb
      # 6. Now entries became unexpected 1 because actually no entries!!!
      # cat per_cpu/cpu0/stats
       entries: 1
       [...]
       read events: 0
    
    To fix it, introduce 'page_removed' field to count total removed pages
    since last reset, then use it to let read iterators reset themselves
    instead of changing the 'read' pointer.

    net/sched: mqprio: Add length check for TCA_MQPRIO_{MAX/MIN}_RATE64
    
    [ Upstream commit 6c58c8816abb7b93b21fa3b1d0c1726402e5e568 ]
    
    The nla_for_each_nested parsing in function mqprio_parse_nlattr() does
    not check the length of the nested attribute. This can lead to an
    out-of-attribute read and allow a malformed nlattr (e.g., length 0) to
    be viewed as 8 byte integer and passed to priv->max_rate/min_rate.
    
    This patch adds the check based on nla_len() when check the nla_type(),
    which ensures that the length of these two attribute must equals
    sizeof(u64).

    platform/x86: msi-laptop: Fix rfkill out-of-sync on MSI Wind U100
    
    [ Upstream commit ad084a6d99bc182bf109c190c808e2ea073ec57b ]
    
    Only the HW rfkill state is toggled on laptops with quirks->ec_read_only
    (so far only MSI Wind U90/U100). There are, however, a few issues with
    the implementation:
    
    1. The initial HW state is always unblocked, regardless of the actual
       state on boot, because msi_init_rfkill only sets the SW state,
       regardless of ec_read_only.
    
    2. The initial SW state corresponds to the actual state on boot, but it
       can't be changed afterwards, because set_device_state returns
       -EOPNOTSUPP. It confuses the userspace, making Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth
       unusable if it was blocked on boot, and breaking the airplane mode if
       the rfkill was unblocked on boot.
    
    Address the above issues by properly initializing the HW state on
    ec_read_only laptops and by allowing the userspace to toggle the SW
    state. Don't set the SW state ourselves and let the userspace fully
    control it. Toggling the SW state is a no-op, however, it allows the
    userspace to properly toggle the airplane mode. The actual SW radio
    disablement is handled by the corresponding rtl818x_pci and btusb
    drivers that have their own rfkills.
    
    Tested on MSI Wind U100 Plus, BIOS ver 1.0G, EC ver 130.

    team: reset team's flags when down link is P2P device

    interfaces, such as when adding a GRE device to team device. Fix this by
    remove multicast/broadcast flags and add p2p and noarp flags.
    
    After removing the none ethernet interface and adding an ethernet interface
    to team, we need to reset team interface flags. Unlike bonding interface,
    team do not need restore IFF_MASTER, IFF_SLAVE flags.

    tcp: Reduce chance of collisions in inet6_hashfn().
    
    [ Upstream commit d11b0df7ddf1831f3e170972f43186dad520bfcc ]
    
    For both IPv4 and IPv6 incoming TCP connections are tracked in a hash
    table with a hash over the source & destination addresses and ports.
    However, the IPv6 hash is insufficient and can lead to a high rate of
    collisions.
    
    The IPv6 hash used an XOR to fit everything into the 96 bits for the
    fast jenkins hash, meaning it is possible for an external entity to
    ensure the hash collides, thus falling back to a linear search in the
    bucket, which is slow.
    
    We take the approach of hash the full length of IPv6 address in
    __ipv6_addr_jhash() so that all users can benefit from a more secure
    version.
    
    While this may look like it adds overhead, the reality of modern CPUs
    means that this is unmeasurable in real world scenarios.
    
    In simulating with llvm-mca, the increase in cycles for the hashing
    code was ~16 cycles on Skylake (from a base of ~155), and an extra ~9
    on Nehalem (base of ~173).
    
    In commit dd6d2910c5e0 ("netfilter: conntrack: switch to siphash")
    netfilter switched from a jenkins hash to a siphash, but even the faster
    hsiphash is a more significant overhead (~20-30%) in some preliminary
    testing.  So, in this patch, we keep to the more conservative approach to
    ensure we don't add much overhead per SYN.
    
    In testing, this results in a consistently even spread across the
    connection buckets.  In both testing and real-world scenarios, we have
    not found any measurable performance impact.

    ftrace: Fix possible warning on checking all pages used in ftrace_process_locs()
    
    [ Upstream commit 26efd79c4624294e553aeaa3439c646729bad084 ]
    
    As comments in ftrace_process_locs(), there may be NULL pointers in
    mcount_loc section:
     > Some architecture linkers will pad between
     > the different mcount_loc sections of different
     > object files to satisfy alignments.
     > Skip any NULL pointers.
    
    After commit 20e5227e9f55 ("ftrace: allow NULL pointers in mcount_loc"),
    NULL pointers will be accounted when allocating ftrace pages but skipped
    before adding into ftrace pages, this may result in some pages not being
    used. Then after commit 706c81f87f84 ("ftrace: Remove extra helper
    functions"), warning may occur at:
      WARN_ON(pg->next);
    
    To fix it, only warn for case that no pointers skipped but pages not used
    up, then free those unused pages after releasing ftrace_lock.

    Looking for ways to shrink the size of the dyn_ftrace structure, knowing the
    information about how many pages and the number of groups of those pages, is
    useful in working out the best ways to save on memory.
    
    This adds one info print on how many groups of pages were used to allocate
    the ftrace dyn_ftrace structures, and also shows the number of pages and
    groups in the dyn_ftrace_total_info (which is used for debugging).

    fs: dlm: interrupt posix locks only when process is killed
    
    [ Upstream commit 59e45c758ca1b9893ac923dd63536da946ac333b ]
    
    If a posix lock request is waiting for a result from user space
    (dlm_controld), do not let it be interrupted unless the process
    is killed. This reverts commit a6b1533e9a57 ("dlm: make posix locks
    interruptible"). The problem with the interruptible change is
    that all locks were cleared on any signal interrupt. If a signal
    was received that did not terminate the process, the process
    could continue running after all its dlm posix locks had been
    cleared. A future patch will add cancelation to allow proper
    interruption.

    dlm: cleanup plock_op vs plock_xop
    
    [ Upstream commit bcbb4ba6c9ba81e6975b642a2cade68044cd8a66 ]
    
    Lately the different casting between plock_op and plock_xop and list
    holders which was involved showed some issues which were hard to see.
    This patch removes the "plock_xop" structure and introduces a
    "struct plock_async_data". This structure will be set in "struct plock_op"
    in case of asynchronous lock handling as the original "plock_xop" was
    made for. There is no need anymore to cast pointers around for
    additional fields in case of asynchronous lock handling.  As disadvantage
    another allocation was introduces but only needed in the asynchronous
    case which is currently only used in combination with nfs lockd.

    PCI/ASPM: Avoid link retraining race
    
    [ Upstream commit e7e39756363ad5bd83ddeae1063193d0f13870fd ]
    
    PCIe r6.0.1, sec 7.5.3.7, recommends setting the link control parameters,
    then waiting for the Link Training bit to be clear before setting the
    Retrain Link bit.
    
    This avoids a race where the LTSSM may not use the updated parameters if it
    is already in the midst of link training because of other normal link
    activity.
    
    Wait for the Link Training bit to be clear before toggling the Retrain Link
    bit to ensure that the LTSSM uses the updated link control parameters.

    The filesystem is corrupted here, journal is partially replayed, and
    new journal sequence number actually is already used by last mounting.
    
    The invalidate_bdev() can drop all buffer heads even racing with bare
    reading block device(eg. systemd-udev), so we can fix it by invalidating
    bdev in error handling path in __ext4_fill_super().

    The parameter 'int n' from bch_bucket_alloc_set() is not cleared

    net: Replace the limit of TCP_LINGER2 with TCP_FIN_TIMEOUT_MAX
    
    [ Upstream commit f0628c524fd188c3f9418e12478dfdfadacba815 ]
    
    This patch changes the behavior of TCP_LINGER2 about its limit. The
    sysctl_tcp_fin_timeout used to be the limit of TCP_LINGER2 but now it's
    only the default value. A new macro named TCP_FIN_TIMEOUT_MAX is added
    as the limit of TCP_LINGER2, which is 2 minutes.
    
    Since TCP_LINGER2 used sysctl_tcp_fin_timeout as the default value
    and the limit in the past, the system administrator cannot set the
    default value for most of sockets and let some sockets have a greater
    timeout. It might be a mistake that let the sysctl to be the limit of
    the TCP_LINGER2. Maybe we can add a new sysctl to set the max of
    TCP_LINGER2, but FIN-WAIT-2 timeout is usually no need to be too long
    and 2 minutes are legal considering TCP specs.
    
    Changes in v3:
    - Remove the new socket option and change the TCP_LINGER2 behavior so
      that the timeout can be set to value between sysctl_tcp_fin_timeout
      and 2 minutes.
    
    Changes in v2:
    - Add int overflow check for the new socket option.
    
    Changes in v1:
    - Add a new socket option to set timeout greater than
      sysctl_tcp_fin_timeout.

    netfilter: nf_tables: fix spurious set element insertion failure
    
    [ Upstream commit ddbd8be68941985f166f5107109a90ce13147c44 ]
    
    On some platforms there is a padding hole in the nft_verdict
    structure, between the verdict code and the chain pointer.
    
    On element insertion, if the new element clashes with an existing one and
    NLM_F_EXCL flag isn't set, we want to ignore the -EEXIST error as long as
    the data associated with duplicated element is the same as the existing
    one.  The data equality check uses memcmp.
    
    For normal data (NFT_DATA_VALUE) this works fine, but for NFT_DATA_VERDICT
    padding area leads to spurious failure even if the verdict data is the
    same.
    
    This then makes the insertion fail with 'already exists' error, even
    though the new "key : data" matches an existing entry and userspace
    told the kernel that it doesn't want to receive an error indication.

    Revert "tcp: avoid the lookup process failing to get sk in ehash table"
    
    [ Upstream commit 81b3ade5d2b98ad6e0a473b0e1e420a801275592 ]
    
    This reverts commit 3f4ca5fafc08881d7a57daa20449d171f2887043.
    
    Commit 3f4ca5fafc08 ("tcp: avoid the lookup process failing to get sk in
    ehash table") reversed the order in how a socket is inserted into ehash
    to fix an issue that ehash-lookup could fail when reqsk/full sk/twsk are
    swapped.  However, it introduced another lookup failure.
    
    The full socket in ehash is allocated from a slab with SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU
    and does not have SOCK_RCU_FREE, so the socket could be reused even while
    it is being referenced on another CPU doing RCU lookup.
    
    Let's say a socket is reused and inserted into the same hash bucket during
    lookup.  After the blamed commit, a new socket is inserted at the end of
    the list.  If that happens, we will skip sockets placed after the previous
    position of the reused socket, resulting in ehash lookup failure.
    
    As described in Documentation/RCU/rculist_nulls.rst, we should insert a
    new socket at the head of the list to avoid such an issue.
    
    This issue, the swap-lookup-failure, and another variant reported in [0]
    can all be handled properly by adding a locked ehash lookup suggested by
    Eric Dumazet [1].
    
    However, this issue could occur for every packet, thus more likely than
    the other two races, so let's revert the change for now.

    [ Upstream commit b685f1a58956fa36cc01123f253351b25bfacfda ]
    
    CPSW ALE has 75 bit ALE entries which are stored within three 32 bit words.
    The cpsw_ale_get_field() and cpsw_ale_set_field() functions assume that the
    field will be strictly contained within one word. However, this is not
    guaranteed to be the case and it is possible for ALE field entries to span
    across up to two words at the most.
    
    Fix the methods to handle getting/setting fields spanning up to two words.

    pinctrl: amd: Use amd_pinconf_set() for all config options
    
    [ Upstream commit 635a750d958e158e17af0f524bedc484b27fbb93 ]
    
    On ASUS TUF A16 it is reported that the ITE5570 ACPI device connected to
    GPIO 7 is causing an interrupt storm.  This issue doesn't happen on
    Windows.
    
    Comparing the GPIO register configuration between Windows and Linux
    bit 20 has been configured as a pull up on Windows, but not on Linux.
    Checking GPIO declaration from the firmware it is clear it *should* have
    been a pull up on Linux as well.
    
    ```
    GpioInt (Level, ActiveLow, Exclusive, PullUp, 0x0000,
             "\\_SB.GPIO", 0x00, ResourceConsumer, ,)
    {   // Pin list
    0x0007
    }
    ```
    
    On Linux amd_gpio_set_config() is currently only used for programming
    the debounce. Actually the GPIO core calls it with all the arguments
    that are supported by a GPIO, pinctrl-amd just responds `-ENOTSUPP`.
    
    To solve this issue expand amd_gpio_set_config() to support the other
    arguments amd_pinconf_set() supports, namely `PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_PULL_DOWN`,
    `PIN_CONFIG_BIAS_PULL_UP`, and `PIN_CONFIG_DRIVE_STRENGTH`.

    igb: Fix igb_down hung on surprise removal
    
    [ Upstream commit 004d25060c78fc31f66da0fa439c544dda1ac9d5 ]
    
    In a setup where a Thunderbolt hub connects to Ethernet and a display
    through USB Type-C, users may experience a hung task timeout when they
    remove the cable between the PC and the Thunderbolt hub.
    This is because the igb_down function is called multiple times when
    the Thunderbolt hub is unplugged. For example, the igb_io_error_detected
    triggers the first call, and the igb_remove triggers the second call.
    The second call to igb_down will block at napi_synchronize.
    Here's the call trace:
        __schedule+0x3b0/0xddb
        ? __mod_timer+0x164/0x5d3

        ? kthread_associate_blkcg+0x71/0x71
        ret_from_fork+0x1f/0x30
    
    In this case, igb_io_error_detected detaches the network interface
    and requests a PCIE slot reset, however, the PCIE reset callback is
    not being invoked and thus the Ethernet connection breaks down.
    As the PCIE error in this case is a non-fatal one, requesting a
    slot reset can be avoided.
    This patch fixes the task hung issue and preserves Ethernet
    connection by ignoring non-fatal PCIE errors.

    wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: avoid baid size integer overflow
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a528ab1da324d078ec60283c34c17848580df24 ]
    
    Roee reported various hard-to-debug crashes with pings in
    EHT aggregation scenarios. Enabling KASAN showed that we
    access the BAID allocation out of bounds, and looking at
    the code a bit shows that since the reorder buffer entry
    (struct iwl_mvm_reorder_buf_entry) is 128 bytes if debug
    such as lockdep is enabled, then staring from an agg size
    512 we overflow the size calculation, and allocate a much
    smaller structure than we should, causing slab corruption
    once we initialize this.
    
    Fix this by simply using u32 instead of u16.

    wifi: wext-core: Fix -Wstringop-overflow warning in ioctl_standard_iw_point()
    
    [ Upstream commit 71e7552c90db2a2767f5c17c7ec72296b0d92061 ]
    
    -Wstringop-overflow is legitimately warning us about extra_size
    pontentially being zero at some point, hence potenially ending
    up _allocating_ zero bytes of memory for extra pointer and then
    trying to access such object in a call to copy_from_user().
    
    Fix this by adding a sanity check to ensure we never end up
    trying to allocate zero bytes of data for extra pointer, before
    continue executing the rest of the code in the function.
    
    Address the following -Wstringop-overflow warning seen when built
    m68k architecture with allyesconfig configuration:

    [ Upstream commit ee9fd0ac3017c4313be91a220a9ac4c99dde7ad4 ]
    
    KCSAN reported a data-race when accessing node->ref.
    Although node->ref does not have to be accurate,
    take this chance to use a more common READ_ONCE() and WRITE_ONCE()
    pattern instead of data_race().
    
    There is an existing bpf_lru_node_is_ref() and bpf_lru_node_set_ref().
    This patch also adds bpf_lru_node_clear_ref() to do the
    WRITE_ONCE(node->ref, 0) also.

    Further investigation shows that the warning is superfluous, the migration
    disabled task is just going to be migrated to its current running CPU.
    This is because that on load balance if the dst_cpu is not allowed by the
    task, we'll re-select a new_dst_cpu as a candidate. If no task can be
    balanced to dst_cpu we'll try to balance the task to the new_dst_cpu
    instead. In this case when the migration disabled task is not on CPU it
    only allows to run on its current CPU, load balance will select its
    current CPU as new_dst_cpu and later triggers the warning above.
    
    The new_dst_cpu is chosen from the env->dst_grpmask. Currently it
    contains CPUs in sched_group_span() and if we have overlapped groups it's
    possible to run into this case. This patch makes env->dst_grpmask of
    group_balance_mask() which exclude any CPUs from the busiest group and
    solve the issue. For balancing in a domain with no overlapped groups
    the behaviour keeps same as before.

    posix-timers: Ensure timer ID search-loop limit is valid
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ce8849dd1e78dadcee0ec9acbd259d239b7069f ]
    
    posix_timer_add() tries to allocate a posix timer ID by starting from the
    cached ID which was stored by the last successful allocation.
    
    This is done in a loop searching the ID space for a free slot one by
    one. The loop has to terminate when the search wrapped around to the
    starting point.
    
    But that's racy vs. establishing the starting point. That is read out
    lockless, which leads to the following problem:
    
    CPU0                               CPU1
    posix_timer_add()
      start = sig->posix_timer_id;
      lock(hash_lock);
      ...                              posix_timer_add()
      if (++sig->posix_timer_id < 0)
                                         start = sig->posix_timer_id;
         sig->posix_timer_id = 0;
    
    So CPU1 can observe a negative start value, i.e. -1, and the loop break
    never happens because the condition can never be true:
    
      if (sig->posix_timer_id == start)
         break;
    
    While this is unlikely to ever turn into an endless loop as the ID space is
    huge (INT_MAX), the racy read of the start value caught the attention of
    KCSAN and Dmitry unearthed that incorrectness.
    
    Rewrite it so that all id operations are under the hash lock.

    md/raid10: prevent soft lockup while flush writes
    
    [ Upstream commit 010444623e7f4da6b4a4dd603a7da7469981e293 ]
    
    Currently, there is no limit for raid1/raid10 plugged bio. While flushing
    writes, raid1 has cond_resched() while raid10 doesn't, and too many
    writes can cause soft lockup.
    
    Follow up soft lockup can be triggered easily with writeback test for
    raid10 with ramdisks:

    Fix the problem by adding cond_resched() to raid10 like what raid1 did.
    
    Note that unlimited plugged bio still need to be optimized, for example,
    in the case of lots of dirty pages writeback, this will take lots of
    memory and io will spend a long time in plug, hence io latency is bad.

    md: fix data corruption for raid456 when reshape restart while grow up
    
    [ Upstream commit 873f50ece41aad5c4f788a340960c53774b5526e ]
    
    Currently, if reshape is interrupted, echo "reshape" to sync_action will
    restart reshape from scratch, for example:
    
    echo frozen > sync_action
    echo reshape > sync_action
    
    This will corrupt data before reshape_position if the array is growing,
    fix the problem by continue reshape from reshape_position.

    ext4: correct inline offset when handling xattrs in inode body
    
    commit 6909cf5c4101214f4305a62d582a5b93c7e1eb9a upstream.
    
    When run on a file system where the inline_data feature has been
    enabled, xfstests generic/269, generic/270, and generic/476 cause ext4
    to emit error messages indicating that inline directory entries are
    corrupted.  This occurs because the inline offset used to locate
    inline directory entries in the inode body is not updated when an
    xattr in that shared region is deleted and the region is shifted in
    memory to recover the space it occupied.  If the deleted xattr precedes
    the system.data attribute, which points to the inline directory entries,
    that attribute will be moved further up in the region.  The inline
    offset continues to point to whatever is located in system.data's former
    location, with unfortunate effects when used to access directory entries
    or (presumably) inline data in the inode body.

    tracing/histograms: Add histograms to hist_vars if they have referenced variables
    
    commit 6018b585e8c6fa7d85d4b38d9ce49a5b67be7078 upstream.
    
    Hist triggers can have referenced variables without having direct
    variables fields. This can be the case if referenced variables are added
    for trigger actions. In this case the newly added references will not
    have field variables. Not taking such referenced variables into
    consideration can result in a bug where it would be possible to remove
    hist trigger with variables being refenced. This will result in a bug
    that is easily reproducable like so
    
    $ cd /sys/kernel/tracing
    $ echo 'synthetic_sys_enter char[] comm; long id' >> synthetic_events
    $ echo 'hist:keys=common_pid.execname,id.syscall:vals=hitcount:comm=common_pid.execname' >> events/raw_syscalls/sys_enter/trigger
    $ echo 'hist:keys=common_pid.execname,id.syscall:onmatch(raw_syscalls.sys_enter).synthetic_sys_enter($comm, id)' >> events/raw_syscalls/sys_enter/trigger
    $ echo '!hist:keys=common_pid.execname,id.syscall:vals=hitcount:comm=common_pid.execname' >> events/raw_syscalls/sys_enter/trigger

    We hit the bug because when second hist trigger has was created
    has_hist_vars() returned false because hist trigger did not have
    variables. As a result of that save_hist_vars() was not called to add
    the trigger to trace_array->hist_vars. Later on when we attempted to
    remove the first histogram find_any_var_ref() failed to detect it is
    being used because it did not find the second trigger in hist_vars list.
    
    With this change we wait until trigger actions are created so we can take
    into consideration if hist trigger has variable references. Also, now we
    check the return value of save_hist_vars() and fail trigger creation if
    save_hist_vars() fails.

    drm/atomic: Fix potential use-after-free in nonblocking commits
    
    commit 4e076c73e4f6e90816b30fcd4a0d7ab365087255 upstream.
    
    This requires a bit of background.  Properly done a modeset driver's
    unload/remove sequence should be
    
            drm_dev_unplug();
            drm_atomic_helper_shutdown();
            drm_dev_put();
    
    The trouble is that the drm_dev_unplugged() checks are by design racy,
    they do not synchronize against all outstanding ioctl.  This is because
    those ioctl could block forever (both for modeset and for driver
    specific ioctls), leading to deadlocks in hotunplug.  Instead the code
    sections that touch the hardware need to be annotated with
    drm_dev_enter/exit, to avoid accessing hardware resources after the
    unload/remove has finished.
    
    To avoid use-after-free issues all the involved userspace visible
    objects are supposed to hold a reference on the underlying drm_device,
    like drm_file does.
    
    The issue now is that we missed one, the atomic modeset ioctl can be run
    in a nonblocking fashion, and in that case it cannot rely on the implied
    drm_device reference provided by the ioctl calling context.  This can
    result in a use-after-free if an nonblocking atomic commit is carefully
    raced against a driver unload.
    
    Fix this by unconditionally grabbing a drm_device reference for any
    drm_atomic_state structures.  Strictly speaking this isn't required for
    blocking commits and TEST_ONLY calls, but it's the simpler approach.
    
    Thanks to shanzhulig for the initial idea of grabbing an unconditional
    reference, I just added comments, a condensed commit message and fixed a
    minor potential issue in where exactly we drop the final reference.

    scsi: qla2xxx: Wait for io return on terminate rport
    
    commit fc0cba0c7be8261a1625098bd1d695077ec621c9 upstream.
    
    System crash due to use after free.
    Current code allows terminate_rport_io to exit before making
    sure all IOs has returned. For FCP-2 device, IO's can hang
    on in HW because driver has not tear down the session in FW at
    first sign of cable pull. When dev_loss_tmo timer pops,
    terminate_rport_io is called and upper layer is about to
    free various resources. Terminate_rport_io trigger qla to do
    the final cleanup, but the cleanup might not be fast enough where it
    leave qla still holding on to the same resource.
    
    Wait for IO's to return to upper layer before resources are freed.

    Through the vmcore, I found it's because in tracing_read_pipe(),
    ring_buffer_empty_cpu() found some buffer is not empty but then it
    cannot read anything due to "rb_num_of_entries() == 0" always true,
    Then it infinitely loop the procedure due to user buffer not been
    filled, see following code path:
    
      tracing_read_pipe() {
        ... ...
        waitagain:
          tracing_wait_pipe() // 1. find non-empty buffer here
          trace_find_next_entry_inc()  // 2. loop here try to find an entry
            __find_next_entry()
              ring_buffer_empty_cpu();  // 3. find non-empty buffer
              peek_next_entry()  // 4. but peek always return NULL
                ring_buffer_peek()
                  rb_buffer_peek()
                    rb_get_reader_page()
                      // 5. because rb_num_of_entries() == 0 always true here
                      //    then return NULL
          // 6. user buffer not been filled so goto 'waitgain'
          //    and eventually leads to an deadloop in kernel!!!
      }
    
    By some analyzing, I found that when resetting ringbuffer, the 'entries'
    of its pages are not all cleared (see rb_reset_cpu()). Then when reducing
    the ringbuffer, and if some reduced pages exist dirty 'entries' data, they
    will be added into 'cpu_buffer->overrun' (see rb_remove_pages()), which
    cause wrong 'overrun' count and eventually cause the deadloop issue.
    
    To fix it, we need to clear every pages in rb_reset_cpu().

    If a better match has already been found, we still need to free the new

    Revert "8250: add support for ASIX devices with a FIFO bug"
    
    commit a82d62f708545d22859584e0e0620da8e3759bbc upstream.
    
    This reverts commit eb26dfe8aa7eeb5a5aa0b7574550125f8aa4c3b3.
    
    Commit eb26dfe8aa7e ("8250: add support for ASIX devices with a FIFO
    bug") merged on Jul 13, 2012 adds a quirk for PCI_VENDOR_ID_ASIX
    (0x9710). But that ID is the same as PCI_VENDOR_ID_NETMOS defined in
    1f8b061050c7 ("[PATCH] Netmos parallel/serial/combo support") merged
    on Mar 28, 2005. In pci_serial_quirks array, the NetMos entry always
    takes precedence over the ASIX entry even since it was initially
    merged, code in that commit is always unreachable.
    
    In my tests, adding the FIFO workaround to pci_netmos_init() makes no
    difference, and the vendor driver also does not have such workaround.
    Given that the code was never used for over a decade, it's safe to
    revert it.
    
    Also, the real PCI_VENDOR_ID_ASIX should be 0x125b, which is used on
    their newer AX99100 PCIe serial controllers released on 2016. The FIFO
    workaround should not be intended for these newer controllers, and it
    was never implemented in vendor driver.

    ceph: don't let check_caps skip sending responses for revoke msgs
    
    commit 257e6172ab36ebbe295a6c9ee9a9dd0fe54c1dc2 upstream.
    
    If a client sends out a cap update dropping caps with the prior 'seq'
    just before an incoming cap revoke request, then the client may drop
    the revoke because it believes it's already released the requested
    capabilities.
    
    This causes the MDS to wait indefinitely for the client to respond
    to the revoke. It's therefore always a good idea to ack the cap
    revoke request with the bumped up 'seq'.

    There is no need to disable them a second time using the

    md/raid0: add discard support for the 'original' layout
    
    commit e836007089ba8fdf24e636ef2b007651fb4582e6 upstream.
    
    We've found that using raid0 with the 'original' layout and discard
    enabled with different disk sizes (such that at least two zones are
    created) can result in data corruption. This is due to the fact that
    the discard handling in 'raid0_handle_discard()' assumes the 'alternate'
    layout. We've seen this corruption using ext4 but other filesystems are
    likely susceptible as well.
    
    More specifically, while multiple zones are necessary to create the
    corruption, the corruption may not occur with multiple zones if they
    layout in such a way the layout matches what the 'alternate' layout
    would have produced. Thus, not all raid0 devices with the 'original'
    layout, different size disks and discard enabled will encounter this
    corruption.
    
    The 3.14 kernel inadvertently changed the raid0 disk layout for different
    size disks. Thus, running a pre-3.14 kernel and post-3.14 kernel on the
    same raid0 array could corrupt data. This lead to the creation of the
    'original' layout (to match the pre-3.14 layout) and the 'alternate' layout
    (to match the post 3.14 layout) in the 5.4 kernel time frame and an option
    to tell the kernel which layout to use (since it couldn't be autodetected).
    However, when the 'original' layout was added back to 5.4 discard support
    for the 'original' layout was not added leading this issue.
    
    I've been able to reliably reproduce the corruption with the following
    test case:
    
    1. create raid0 array with different size disks using original layout
    2. mkfs
    3. mount -o discard
    4. create lots of files
    5. remove 1/2 the files
    6. fstrim -a (or just the mount point for the raid0 array)
    7. umount
    8. fsck -fn /dev/md0 (spews all sorts of corruptions)
    
    Let's fix this by adding proper discard support to the 'original' layout.
    The fix 'maps' the 'original' layout disks to the order in which they are
    read/written such that we can compare the disks in the same way that the
    current 'alternate' layout does. A 'disk_shift' field is added to
    'struct strip_zone'. This could be computed on the fly in
    raid0_handle_discard() but by adding this field, we save some computation
    in the discard path.
    
    Note we could also potentially fix this by re-ordering the disks in the
    zones that follow the first one, and then always read/writing them using
    the 'alternate' layout. However, that is seen as a more substantial change,
    and we are attempting the least invasive fix at this time to remedy the
    corruption.
    
    I've verified the change using the reproducer mentioned above. Typically,
    the corruption is seen after less than 3 iterations, while the patch has
    run 500+ iterations.

    misc: pci_endpoint_test: Re-init completion for every test
    
    commit fb620ae73b70c2f57b9d3e911fc24c024ba2324f upstream.
    
    The irq_raised completion used to detect the end of a test case is
    initialized when the test device is probed, but never reinitialized again
    before a test case. As a result, the irq_raised completion synchronization
    is effective only for the first ioctl test case executed. Any subsequent
    call to wait_for_completion() by another ioctl() call will immediately
    return, potentially too early, leading to false positive failures.
    
    Fix this by reinitializing the irq_raised completion before starting a new
    ioctl() test command.

    PCI: rockchip: Use u32 variable to access 32-bit registers
    
    commit 8962b2cb39119cbda4fc69a1f83957824f102f81 upstream.
    
    Previously u16 variables were used to access 32-bit registers, this
    resulted in not all of the data being read from the registers. Also

    PCI: rockchip: Fix legacy IRQ generation for RK3399 PCIe endpoint core
    
    commit 166e89d99dd85a856343cca51eee781b793801f2 upstream.
    
    Fix legacy IRQ generation for RK3399 PCIe endpoint core according to
    the technical reference manual (TRM). Assert and deassert legacy
    interrupt (INTx) through the legacy interrupt control register
    ("PCIE_CLIENT_LEGACY_INT_CTRL") instead of manually generating a PCIe
    message. The generation of the legacy interrupt was tested and validated
    with the PCIe endpoint test driver.

    PCI: rockchip: Add poll and timeout to wait for PHY PLLs to be locked
    
    commit 9dd3c7c4c8c3f7f010d9cdb7c3f42506d93c9527 upstream.
    
    The RK3399 PCIe controller should wait until the PHY PLLs are locked.
    Add poll and timeout to wait for PHY PLLs to be locked. If they cannot
    be locked generate error message and jump to error handler. Accessing
    registers in the PHY clock domain when PLLs are not locked causes hang
    The PHY PLLs status is checked through a side channel register.
    This is documented in the TRM section 17.5.8.1 "PCIe Initialization
    Sequence".

    Marvell's own product brief implies the 92xx series are a closely related
    family, and sure enough it turns out that 9235 seems to need the same quirk

    jfs: jfs_dmap: Validate db_l2nbperpage while mounting
    
    commit 11509910c599cbd04585ec35a6d5e1a0053d84c1 upstream.
    
    In jfs_dmap.c at line 381, BLKTODMAP is used to get a logical block
    number inside dbFree(). db_l2nbperpage, which is the log2 number of
    blocks per page, is passed as an argument to BLKTODMAP which uses it
    for shifting.
    
    Syzbot reported a shift out-of-bounds crash because db_l2nbperpage is
    too big. This happens because the large value is set without any
    validation in dbMount() at line 181.
    
    Thus, make sure that db_l2nbperpage is correct while mounting.
    
    Max number of blocks per page = Page size / Min block size
    => log2(Max num_block per page) = log2(Page size / Min block size)
                                    = log2(Page size) - log2(Min block size)
    
    => Max db_l2nbperpage = L2PSIZE - L2MINBLOCKSIZE

    ext4: only update i_reserved_data_blocks on successful block allocation
    
    commit de25d6e9610a8b30cce9bbb19b50615d02ebca02 upstream.
    
    In our fault injection test, we create an ext4 file, migrate it to
    non-extent based file, then punch a hole and finally trigger a WARN_ON
    in the ext4_da_update_reserve_space():
    
    EXT4-fs warning (device sda): ext4_da_update_reserve_space:369:
    ino 14, used 11 with only 10 reserved data blocks
    
    When writing back a non-extent based file, if we enable delalloc, the
    number of reserved blocks will be subtracted from the number of blocks
    mapped by ext4_ind_map_blocks(), and the extent status tree will be
    updated. We update the extent status tree by first removing the old
    extent_status and then inserting the new extent_status. If the block range
    we remove happens to be in an extent, then we need to allocate another
    extent_status with ext4_es_alloc_extent().
    
           use old    to remove   to add new
        |----------|------------|------------|
                  old extent_status
    
    The problem is that the allocation of a new extent_status failed due to a
    fault injection, and __es_shrink() did not get free memory, resulting in
    a return of -ENOMEM. Then do_writepages() retries after receiving -ENOMEM,
    we map to the same extent again, and the number of reserved blocks is again
    subtracted from the number of blocks in that extent. Since the blocks in
    the same extent are subtracted twice, we end up triggering WARN_ON at
    ext4_da_update_reserve_space() because used > ei->i_reserved_data_blocks.
    
    For non-extent based file, we update the number of reserved blocks after
    ext4_ind_map_blocks() is executed, which causes a problem that when we call
    ext4_ind_map_blocks() to create a block, it doesn't always create a block,
    but we always reduce the number of reserved blocks. So we move the logic
    for updating reserved blocks to ext4_ind_map_blocks() to ensure that the
    number of reserved blocks is updated only after we do succeed in allocating
    some new blocks.

    net: bcmgenet: Ensure MDIO unregistration has clocks enabled
    
    commit 1b5ea7ffb7a3bdfffb4b7f40ce0d20a3372ee405 upstream.
    
    With support for Ethernet PHY LEDs having been added, while
    unregistering a MDIO bus and its child device liks PHYs there may be
    "late" accesses to the MDIO bus. One typical use case is setting the PHY
    LEDs brightness to OFF for instance.
    
    We need to ensure that the MDIO bus controller remains entirely
    functional since it runs off the main GENET adapter clock.

    tpm: tpm_vtpm_proxy: fix a race condition in /dev/vtpmx creation
    
    commit f4032d615f90970d6c3ac1d9c0bce3351eb4445c upstream.
    
    /dev/vtpmx is made visible before 'workqueue' is initialized, which can
    lead to a memory corruption in the worst case scenario.
    
    Address this by initializing 'workqueue' as the very first step of the
    driver initialization.

    commit 0d5ace1a07f7e846d0f6d972af60d05515599d0b upstream.
    
    It's uncommon to use debounce on any other pin, but technically

    pinctrl: amd: Detect internal GPIO0 debounce handling
    
    commit 968ab9261627fa305307e3935ca1a32fcddd36cb upstream.
    
    commit 4e5a04be88fe ("pinctrl: amd: disable and mask interrupts on probe")
    had a mistake in loop iteration 63 that it would clear offset 0xFC instead
    of 0x100.  Offset 0xFC is actually `WAKE_INT_MASTER_REG`.  This was
    clearing bits 13 and 15 from the register which significantly changed the
    expected handling for some platforms for GPIO0.
    
    commit b26cd9325be4 ("pinctrl: amd: Disable and mask interrupts on resume")
    actually fixed this bug, but lead to regressions on Lenovo Z13 and some
    other systems.  This is because there was no handling in the driver for bit
    15 debounce behavior.
    
    Quoting a public BKDG:
    ```
    EnWinBlueBtn. Read-write. Reset: 0. 0=GPIO0 detect debounced power button;
    Power button override is 4 seconds. 1=GPIO0 detect debounced power button
    in S3/S5/S0i3, and detect "pressed less than 2 seconds" and "pressed 2~10
    seconds" in S0; Power button override is 10 seconds
    ```
    
    Cross referencing the same master register in Windows it's obvious that
    Windows doesn't use debounce values in this configuration.  So align the
    Linux driver to do this as well.  This fixes wake on lid when
    WAKE_INT_MASTER_REG is properly programmed.

    ipv6/addrconf: fix a potential refcount underflow for idev
    
    [ Upstream commit 06a0716949c22e2aefb648526580671197151acc ]
    
    Now in addrconf_mod_rs_timer(), reference idev depends on whether
    rs_timer is not pending. Then modify rs_timer timeout.
    
    There is a time gap in [1], during which if the pending rs_timer
    becomes not pending. It will miss to hold idev, but the rs_timer
    is activated. Thus rs_timer callback function addrconf_rs_timer()
    will be executed and put idev later without holding idev. A refcount
    underflow issue for idev can be caused by this.
    
            if (!timer_pending(&idev->rs_timer))
                    in6_dev_hold(idev);
                      <--------------[1]
            mod_timer(&idev->rs_timer, jiffies + when);
    
    To fix the issue, hold idev if mod_timer() return 0.

    icmp6: Fix null-ptr-deref of ip6_null_entry->rt6i_idev in icmp6_dev().
    
    [ Upstream commit 2aaa8a15de73874847d62eb595c6683bface80fd ]
    
    With some IPv6 Ext Hdr (RPL, SRv6, etc.), we can send a packet that
    has the link-local address as src and dst IP and will be forwarded to
    an external IP in the IPv6 Ext Hdr.
    
    For example, the script below generates a packet whose src IP is the
    link-local address and dst is updated to 11::.
    
      # for f in $(find /proc/sys/net/ -name *seg6_enabled*); do echo 1 > $f; done
      # python3
      >>> from socket import *
      >>> from scapy.all import *
      >>>
      >>> SRC_ADDR = DST_ADDR = "fe80::5054:ff:fe12:3456"
      >>>
      >>> pkt = IPv6(src=SRC_ADDR, dst=DST_ADDR)
      >>> pkt /= IPv6ExtHdrSegmentRouting(type=4, addresses=["11::", "22::"], segleft=1)
      >>>
      >>> sk = socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_RAW)
      >>> sk.sendto(bytes(pkt), (DST_ADDR, 0))
    
    For such a packet, we call ip6_route_input() to look up a route for the
    next destination in these three functions depending on the header type.
    
      * ipv6_rthdr_rcv()
      * ipv6_rpl_srh_rcv()
      * ipv6_srh_rcv()
    
    If no route is found, ip6_null_entry is set to skb, and the following
    dst_input(skb) calls ip6_pkt_drop().
    
    Finally, in icmp6_dev(), we dereference skb_rt6_info(skb)->rt6i_idev->dev
    as the input device is the loopback interface.  Then, we have to check if
    skb_rt6_info(skb)->rt6i_idev is NULL or not to avoid NULL pointer deref
    for ip6_null_entry.

    workqueue: clean up WORK_* constant types, clarify masking
    
    commit afa4bb778e48d79e4a642ed41e3b4e0de7489a6c upstream.
    
    Dave Airlie reports that gcc-13.1.1 has started complaining about some
    of the workqueue code in 32-bit arm builds:
    
      kernel/workqueue.c: In function ‘get_work_pwq’:
      kernel/workqueue.c:713:24: error: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Werror=int-to-pointer-cast]
        713 |                 return (void *)(data & WORK_STRUCT_WQ_DATA_MASK);
            |                        ^
      [ ... a couple of other cases ... ]
    
    and while it's not immediately clear exactly why gcc started complaining
    about it now, I suspect it's some C23-induced enum type handlign fixup in
    gcc-13 is the cause.
    
    Whatever the reason for starting to complain, the code and data types
    are indeed disgusting enough that the complaint is warranted.
    
    The wq code ends up creating various "helper constants" (like that
    WORK_STRUCT_WQ_DATA_MASK) using an enum type, which is all kinds of
    confused.  The mask needs to be 'unsigned long', not some unspecified
    enum type.
    
    To make matters worse, the actual "mask and cast to a pointer" is
    repeated a couple of times, and the cast isn't even always done to the
    right pointer, but - as the error case above - to a 'void *' with then
    the compiler finishing the job.
    
    That's now how we roll in the kernel.
    
    So create the masks using the proper types rather than some ambiguous
    enumeration, and use a nice helper that actually does the type
    conversion in one well-defined place.
    
    Incidentally, this magically makes clang generate better code.  That,
    admittedly, is really just a sign of clang having been seriously
    confused before, and cleaning up the typing unconfuses the compiler too.

    commit 7a8227b2e76be506b2ac64d2beac950ca04892a5 upstream.
    
    dev_set_rx_mode() grabs a spin_lock, and the lan743x implementation
    proceeds subsequently to go to sleep using readx_poll_timeout().
    
    Introduce a helper wrapping the readx_poll_timeout_atomic() function
    and use it to replace the calls to readx_polL_timeout().

    netfilter: nf_tables: prevent OOB access in nft_byteorder_eval
    
    commit caf3ef7468f7534771b5c44cd8dbd6f7f87c2cbd upstream.
    
    When evaluating byteorder expressions with size 2, a union with 32-bit and
    16-bit members is used. Since the 16-bit members are aligned to 32-bit,
    the array accesses will be out-of-bounds.
    
    It may lead to a stack-out-of-bounds access like the one below:

    netfilter: conntrack: Avoid nf_ct_helper_hash uses after free
    
    commit 6eef7a2b933885a17679eb8ed0796ddf0ee5309b upstream.
    
    If nf_conntrack_init_start() fails (for example due to a
    register_nf_conntrack_bpf() failure), the nf_conntrack_helper_fini()
    clean-up path frees the nf_ct_helper_hash map.
    
    When built with NF_CONNTRACK=y, further netfilter modules (e.g:
    netfilter_conntrack_ftp) can still be loaded and call
    nf_conntrack_helpers_register(), independently of whether nf_conntrack
    initialized correctly. This accesses the nf_ct_helper_hash dangling
    pointer and causes a uaf, possibly leading to random memory corruption.
    
    This patch guards nf_conntrack_helper_register() from accessing a freed
    or uninitialized nf_ct_helper_hash pointer and fixes possible
    uses-after-free when loading a conntrack module.

    netfilter: nf_tables: incorrect error path handling with NFT_MSG_NEWRULE
    
    [ 1240eb93f0616b21c675416516ff3d74798fdc97 ]
    
    In case of error when adding a new rule that refers to an anonymous set,
    deactivate expressions via NFT_TRANS_PREPARE state, not NFT_TRANS_RELEASE.
    Thus, the lookup expression marks anonymous sets as inactive in the next
    generation to ensure it is not reachable in this transaction anymore and
    decrement the set refcount as introduced by c1592a89942e ("netfilter:
    nf_tables: deactivate anonymous set from preparation phase"). The abort
    step takes care of undoing the anonymous set.
    
    This is also consistent with rule deletion, where NFT_TRANS_PREPARE is
    used. Note that this error path is exercised in the preparation step of
    the commit protocol. This patch replaces nf_tables_rule_release() by the
    deactivate and destroy calls, this time with NFT_TRANS_PREPARE.
    
    Due to this incorrect error handling, it is possible to access a
    dangling pointer to the anonymous set that remains in the transaction
    list.

    netfilter: nf_tables: fix nat hook table deletion
    
    [ 1e9451cbda456a170518b2bfd643e2cb980880bf ]
    
    sybot came up with following transaction:
     add table ip syz0
     add chain ip syz0 syz2 { type nat hook prerouting priority 0; policy accept; }
     add table ip syz0 { flags dormant; }
     delete chain ip syz0 syz2
     delete table ip syz0
    
    which yields:
    hook not found, pf 2 num 0
    WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 6775 at net/netfilter/core.c:413 __nf_unregister_net_hook+0x3e6/0x4a0 net/netfilter/core.c:413

    Problem is that when I added ability to override base hook registration
    to make nat basechains register with the nat core instead of netfilter
    core, I forgot to update nft_table_disable() to use that instead of
    the 'raw' hook register interface.
    
    In syzbot transaction, the basechain is of 'nat' type. Its registered
    with the nat core.  The switch to 'dormant mode' attempts to delete from
    netfilter core instead.
    
    After updating nft_table_disable/enable to use the correct helper,
    nft_(un)register_basechain_hooks can be folded into the only remaining
    caller.
    
    Because nft_trans_table_enable() won't do anything when the DORMANT flag
    is set, remove the flag first, then re-add it in case re-enablement
    fails, else this patch breaks sequence:
    
    add table ip x { flags dormant; }
    /* add base chains */
    add table ip x
    
    The last 'add' will remove the dormant flags, but won't have any other
    effect -- base chains are not registered.
    Then, next 'set dormant flag' will create another 'hook not found'
    splat.

    spi: spi-fsl-spi: allow changing bits_per_word while CS is still active
    
    commit a798a7086c38d91d304132c194cff9f02197f5cd upstream.
    
    Commit c9bfcb315104 (spi_mpc83xx: much improved driver) introduced
    logic to ensure bits_per_word and speed_hz stay the same for a series
    of spi_transfers with CS active, arguing that
    
        The current driver may cause glitches on SPI CLK line since one
        must disable the SPI controller before changing any HW settings.
    
    This sounds quite reasonable. So this is a quite naive attempt at
    relaxing this sanity checking to only ensure that speed_hz is
    constant - in the faint hope that if we do not causes changes to the
    clock-related fields of the SPMODE register (DIV16 and PM), those
    glitches won't appear.
    
    The purpose of this change is to allow automatically optimizing large
    transfers to use 32 bits-per-word; taking one interrupt for every byte
    is extremely slow.

    spi: spi-fsl-spi: relax message sanity checking a little
    
    commit 17ecffa289489e8442306bbc62ebb964e235cdad upstream.
    
    The comment says that we should not allow changes (to
    bits_per_word/speed_hz) while CS is active, and indeed the code below
    does fsl_spi_setup_transfer() when the ->cs_change of the previous
    spi_transfer was set (and for the very first transfer).
    
    So the sanity checking is a bit too strict - we can change it to
    follow the same logic as is used by the actual transfer loop.

    btrfs: fix race when deleting quota root from the dirty cow roots list
    
    commit b31cb5a6eb7a48b0a7bfdf06832b1fd5088d8c79 upstream.
    
    When disabling quotas we are deleting the quota root from the list
    fs_info->dirty_cowonly_roots without taking the lock that protects it,
    which is struct btrfs_fs_info::trans_lock. This unsynchronized list
    manipulation may cause chaos if there's another concurrent manipulation
    of this list, such as when adding a root to it with
    ctree.c:add_root_to_dirty_list().
    
    This can result in all sorts of weird failures caused by a race, such as
    the following crash:

    Also update definition when CONFIG_JFFS2_FS_XATTR is not enabled
    
    Tested with an MTD mount point and some user set/getfattr.

    integrity: Fix possible multiple allocation in integrity_inode_get()
    
    commit 9df6a4870dc371136e90330cfbbc51464ee66993 upstream.
    
    When integrity_inode_get() is querying and inserting the cache, there
    is a conditional race in the concurrent environment.
    
    The race condition is the result of not properly implementing
    "double-checked locking". In this case, it first checks to see if the
    iint cache record exists before taking the lock, but doesn't check
    again after taking the integrity_iint_lock.

    mmc: core: disable TRIM on Micron MTFC4GACAJCN-1M
    
    commit dbfbddcddcebc9ce8a08757708d4e4a99d238e44 upstream.
    
    It seems that Micron MTFC4GACAJCN-1M despite advertising TRIM support does
    not work when the core is trying to use REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROES.
    
    We are seeing the following errors in OpenWrt under 6.1 on Qnap Qhora 301W
    that we did not previously have and tracked it down to REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROES:
    [   18.085950] I/O error, dev loop0, sector 596 op 0x9:(WRITE_ZEROES) flags 0x800 phys_seg 0 prio class 2
    
    Disabling TRIM makes the error go away, so lets add a quirk for this eMMC
    to disable TRIM.

    ALSA: jack: Fix mutex call in snd_jack_report()
    
    [ Upstream commit 89dbb335cb6a627a4067bc42caa09c8bc3326d40 ]
    
    snd_jack_report() is supposed to be callable from an IRQ context, too,
    and it's indeed used in that way from virtsnd driver.  The fix for
    input_dev race in commit 1b6a6fc5280e ("ALSA: jack: Access input_dev
    under mutex"), however, introduced a mutex lock in snd_jack_report(),
    and this resulted in a potential sleep-in-atomic.
    
    For addressing that problem, this patch changes the relevant code to
    use the object get/put and removes the mutex usage.  That is,
    snd_jack_report(), it takes input_get_device() and leaves with
    input_put_device() for assuring the input_dev being assigned.
    
    Although the whole mutex could be reduced, we keep it because it can
    be still a protection for potential races between creation and
    deletion.

    i2c: xiic: Don't try to handle more interrupt events after error
    
    [ Upstream commit cb6e45c9a0ad9e0f8664fd06db0227d185dc76ab ]
    
    In xiic_process, it is possible that error events such as arbitration
    lost or TX error can be raised in conjunction with other interrupt flags
    such as TX FIFO empty or bus not busy. Error events result in the
    controller being reset and the error returned to the calling request,
    but the function could potentially try to keep handling the other
    events, such as by writing more messages into the TX FIFO. Since the
    transaction has already failed, this is not helpful and will just cause
    issues.
    
    This problem has been present ever since:
    
    commit 7f9906bd7f72 ("i2c: xiic: Service all interrupts in isr")
    
    which allowed non-error events to be handled after errors, but became
    more obvious after:
    
    commit 743e227a8959 ("i2c: xiic: Defer xiic_wakeup() and
    __xiic_start_xfer() in xiic_process()")
    
    which reworked the code to add a WARN_ON which triggers if both the
    xfer_more and wakeup_req flags were set, since this combination is
    not supposed to happen, but was occurring in this scenario.
    
    Skip further interrupt handling after error flags are detected to avoid
    this problem.

    sh: dma: Fix DMA channel offset calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit e82e47584847129a20b8c9f4a1dcde09374fb0e0 ]
    
    Various SoCs of the SH3, SH4 and SH4A family, which use this driver,
    feature a differing number of DMA channels, which can be distributed
    between up to two DMAC modules. The existing implementation fails to
    correctly accommodate for all those variations, resulting in wrong
    channel offset calculations and leading to kernel panics.
    
    Rewrite dma_base_addr() in order to properly calculate channel offsets
    in a DMAC module. Fix dmaor_read_reg() and dmaor_write_reg(), so that
    the correct DMAC module base is selected for the DMAOR register.

    The attribute TCA_PEDIT_PARMS_EX is not be included in pedit_policy and
    one malicious user could fake a TCA_PEDIT_PARMS_EX whose length is
    smaller than the intended sizeof(struct tc_pedit). Hence, the

    {
      // ...
      pattr = tb[TCA_PEDIT_PARMS]; // TCA_PEDIT_PARMS is included
      if (!pattr)
        pattr = tb[TCA_PEDIT_PARMS_EX]; // but this is not
    
      // ...
      parm = nla_data(pattr);

    net: bridge: keep ports without IFF_UNICAST_FLT in BR_PROMISC mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 6ca3c005d0604e8d2b439366e3923ea58db99641 ]
    
    According to the synchronization rules for .ndo_get_stats() as seen in
    Documentation/networking/netdevices.rst, acquiring a plain spin_lock()
    should not be illegal, but the bridge driver implementation makes it so.
    
    After running these commands, I am being faced with the following
    lockdep splat:
    
    $ ip link add link swp0 name macsec0 type macsec encrypt on && ip link set swp0 up
    $ ip link add dev br0 type bridge vlan_filtering 1 && ip link set br0 up
    $ ip link set macsec0 master br0 && ip link set macsec0 up
    
      ========================================================
      WARNING: possible irq lock inversion dependency detected

      --------------------------------------------------------
      swapper/1/0 just changed the state of lock:
      ffff6bd348724cd8 (&br->lock){+.-.}-{3:3}, at: br_forward_delay_timer_expired+0x34/0x198
      but this lock took another, SOFTIRQ-unsafe lock in the past:
       (&ocelot->stats_lock){+.+.}-{3:3}
    
      and interrupts could create inverse lock ordering between them.
    
      other info that might help us debug this:
      Chain exists of:
        &br->lock --> &br->hash_lock --> &ocelot->stats_lock
    
       Possible interrupt unsafe locking scenario:
    
             CPU0                    CPU1
             ----                    ----
        lock(&ocelot->stats_lock);
                                     local_irq_disable();
                                     lock(&br->lock);
                                     lock(&br->hash_lock);
        <Interrupt>
          lock(&br->lock);
    
       *** DEADLOCK ***
    
    (details about the 3 locks skipped)
    
    swp0 is instantiated by drivers/net/dsa/ocelot/felix.c, and this
    only matters to the extent that its .ndo_get_stats64() method calls
    spin_lock(&ocelot->stats_lock).
    
    Documentation/locking/lockdep-design.rst says:
    
    | A lock is irq-safe means it was ever used in an irq context, while a lock
    | is irq-unsafe means it was ever acquired with irq enabled.
    
    (...)
    
    | Furthermore, the following usage based lock dependencies are not allowed
    | between any two lock-classes::
    |
    |    <hardirq-safe>   ->  <hardirq-unsafe>
    |    <softirq-safe>   ->  <softirq-unsafe>
    
    Lockdep marks br->hash_lock as softirq-safe, because it is sometimes
    taken in softirq context (for example br_fdb_update() which runs in
    NET_RX softirq), and when it's not in softirq context it blocks softirqs
    by using spin_lock_bh().
    
    Lockdep marks ocelot->stats_lock as softirq-unsafe, because it never
    blocks softirqs from running, and it is never taken from softirq
    context. So it can always be interrupted by softirqs.
    
    There is a call path through which a function that holds br->hash_lock:
    fdb_add_hw_addr() will call a function that acquires ocelot->stats_lock:
    ocelot_port_get_stats64(). This can be seen below:
    
    ocelot_port_get_stats64+0x3c/0x1e0
    felix_get_stats64+0x20/0x38
    dsa_slave_get_stats64+0x3c/0x60

    netlink_rcv_skb+0x128/0x148
    rtnetlink_rcv+0x24/0x38
    
    the plain English explanation for it is:
    
    The macsec0 bridge port is created without p->flags & BR_PROMISC,
    because it is what br_manage_promisc() decides for a VLAN filtering
    bridge with a single auto port.
    
    As part of the br_add_if() procedure, br_fdb_add_local() is called for
    the MAC address of the device, and this results in a call to
    dev_uc_add() for macsec0 while the softirq-safe br->hash_lock is taken.
    
    Because macsec0 does not have IFF_UNICAST_FLT, dev_uc_add() ends up
    calling __dev_set_promiscuity() for macsec0, which is propagated by its
    implementation, macsec_dev_change_rx_flags(), to the lower device: swp0.
    This triggers the call path:
    
    dev_set_promiscuity(swp0)
    -> rtmsg_ifinfo()
       -> dev_get_stats()
          -> ocelot_port_get_stats64()
    
    with a calling context that lockdep doesn't like (br->hash_lock held).
    
    Normally we don't see this, because even though many drivers that can be
    bridge ports don't support IFF_UNICAST_FLT, we need a driver that
    
    (a) doesn't support IFF_UNICAST_FLT, *and*
    (b) it forwards the IFF_PROMISC flag to another driver, and
    (c) *that* driver implements ndo_get_stats64() using a softirq-unsafe
        spinlock.
    
    Condition (b) is necessary because the first __dev_set_rx_mode() calls
    __dev_set_promiscuity() with "bool notify=false", and thus, the
    rtmsg_ifinfo() code path won't be entered.
    
    The same criteria also hold true for DSA switches which don't report
    IFF_UNICAST_FLT. When the DSA master uses a spin_lock() in its
    ndo_get_stats64() method, the same lockdep splat can be seen.
    
    I think the deadlock possibility is real, even though I didn't reproduce
    it, and I'm thinking of the following situation to support that claim:
    
    fdb_add_hw_addr() runs on a CPU A, in a context with softirqs locally
    disabled and br->hash_lock held, and may end up attempting to acquire
    ocelot->stats_lock.
    
    In parallel, ocelot->stats_lock is currently held by a thread B (say,
    ocelot_check_stats_work()), which is interrupted while holding it by a
    softirq which attempts to lock br->hash_lock.
    
    Thread B cannot make progress because br->hash_lock is held by A. Whereas
    thread A cannot make progress because ocelot->stats_lock is held by B.
    
    When taking the issue at face value, the bridge can avoid that problem
    by simply making the ports promiscuous from a code path with a saner
    calling context (br->hash_lock not held). A bridge port without
    IFF_UNICAST_FLT is going to become promiscuous as soon as we call
    dev_uc_add() on it (which we do unconditionally), so why not be
    preemptive and make it promiscuous right from the beginning, so as to
    not be taken by surprise.
    
    With this, we've broken the links between code that holds br->hash_lock
    or br->lock and code that calls into the ndo_change_rx_flags() or
    ndo_get_stats64() ops of the bridge port.

    mailbox: ti-msgmgr: Fill non-message tx data fields with 0x0
    
    [ Upstream commit 1b712f18c461bd75f018033a15cf381e712806b5 ]
    
    Sec proxy/message manager data buffer is 60 bytes with the last of the
    registers indicating transmission completion. This however poses a bit
    of a challenge.
    
    The backing memory for sec_proxy / message manager is regular memory,
    and all sec proxy does is to trigger a burst of all 60 bytes of data
    over to the target thread backing ring accelerator. It doesn't do a
    memory scrub when it moves data out in the burst. When we transmit
    multiple messages, remnants of previous message is also transmitted
    which results in some random data being set in TISCI fields of
    messages that have been expanded forward.
    
    The entire concept of backward compatibility hinges on the fact that
    the unused message fields remain 0x0 allowing for 0x0 value to be
    specially considered when backward compatibility of message extension
    is done.
    
    So, instead of just writing the completion register, we continue
    to fill the message buffer up with 0x0 (note: for partial message
    involving completion, we already do this).
    
    This allows us to scale and introduce ABI changes back also work with
    other boot stages that may have left data in the internal memory.
    
    While at this, be consistent and explicit with the data_reg pointer
    increment.

    spi: bcm-qspi: return error if neither hif_mspi nor mspi is available
    
    [ Upstream commit 7c1f23ad34fcdace50275a6aa1e1969b41c6233f ]
    
    If neither a "hif_mspi" nor "mspi" resource is present, the driver will
    just early exit in probe but still return success. Apart from not doing
    anything meaningful, this would then also lead to a null pointer access
    on removal, as platform_get_drvdata() would return NULL, which it would
    then try to dereference when trying to unregister the spi master.
    
    Fix this by unconditionally calling devm_ioremap_resource(), as it can
    handle a NULL res and will then return a viable ERR_PTR() if we get one.
    
    The "return 0;" was previously a "goto qspi_resource_err;" where then
    ret was returned, but since ret was still initialized to 0 at this place
    this was a valid conversion in 63c5395bb7a9 ("spi: bcm-qspi: Fix
    use-after-free on unbind"). The issue was not introduced by this commit,
    only made more obvious.

    sctp: fix potential deadlock on &net->sctp.addr_wq_lock
    
    [ Upstream commit 6feb37b3b06e9049e20dcf7e23998f92c9c5be9a ]
    
    As &net->sctp.addr_wq_lock is also acquired by the timer
    sctp_addr_wq_timeout_handler() in protocal.c, the same lock acquisition
    at sctp_auto_asconf_init() seems should disable irq since it is called
    from sctp_accept() under process context.
    
    Possible deadlock scenario:
    sctp_accept()
        -> sctp_sock_migrate()
        -> sctp_auto_asconf_init()
        -> spin_lock(&net->sctp.addr_wq_lock)
            <timer interrupt>
            -> sctp_addr_wq_timeout_handler()
            -> spin_lock_bh(&net->sctp.addr_wq_lock); (deadlock here)
    
    This flaw was found using an experimental static analysis tool we are
    developing for irq-related deadlock.
    
    The tentative patch fix the potential deadlock by spin_lock_bh().

    KVM: s390: fix KVM_S390_GET_CMMA_BITS for GFNs in memslot holes
    
    [ Upstream commit 285cff4c0454340a4dc53f46e67f2cb1c293bd74 ]
    
    The KVM_S390_GET_CMMA_BITS ioctl may return incorrect values when userspace
    specifies a start_gfn outside of memslots.
    
    This can occur when a VM has multiple memslots with a hole in between:
    
    +-----+----------+--------+--------+
    | ... | Slot N-1 | <hole> | Slot N |
    +-----+----------+--------+--------+
          ^          ^        ^        ^
          |          |        |        |
    GFN   A          A+B      |        |
                              A+B+C    |
                                       A+B+C+D
    
    When userspace specifies a GFN in [A+B, A+B+C), it would expect to get the
    CMMA values of the first dirty page in Slot N. However, userspace may get a
    start_gfn of A+B+C+D with a count of 0, hence completely skipping over any
    dirty pages in slot N.
    
    The error is in kvm_s390_next_dirty_cmma(), which assumes
    gfn_to_memslot_approx() will return the memslot _below_ the specified GFN
    when the specified GFN lies outside a memslot. In reality it may return
    either the memslot below or above the specified GFN.
    
    When a memslot above the specified GFN is returned this happens:
    
    - ofs is calculated, but since the memslot's base_gfn is larger than the
      specified cur_gfn, ofs will underflow to a huge number.
    - ofs is passed to find_next_bit(). Since ofs will exceed the memslot's
      number of pages, the number of pages in the memslot is returned,
      completely skipping over all bits in the memslot userspace would be
      interested in.
    
    Fix this by resetting ofs to zero when a memslot _above_ cur_gfn is
    returned (cur_gfn < ms->base_gfn).

    [ Upstream commit 26ae58f65e64fa7ba61d64bae752e59e08380c6a ]
    
    VIDIOC_ENUMINPUT documentation describes the tuner field of
    struct v4l2_input as index:
    
    Documentation/userspace-api/media/v4l/vidioc-enuminput.rst
    "
    * - __u32
      - ``tuner``
      - Capture devices can have zero or more tuners (RF demodulators).
        When the ``type`` is set to ``V4L2_INPUT_TYPE_TUNER`` this is an
        RF connector and this field identifies the tuner. It corresponds
        to struct :c:type:`v4l2_tuner` field ``index``. For
        details on tuners see :ref:`tuner`.

    Drivers I could find also use the 'tuner' field as an index, e.g.:

    drivers/media/usb/go7007/go7007-v4l2.c vidioc_enum_input()
    
    However, the UAPI comment claims this field is 'enum v4l2_tuner_type':
    include/uapi/linux/videodev2.h
    
    This field being 'enum v4l2_tuner_type' is unlikely as it seems to be
    never used that way in drivers, and documentation confirms it. It seem
    this comment got in accidentally in the commit which this patch fixes.

    block: change all __u32 annotations to __be32 in affs_hardblocks.h
    
    commit 95a55437dc49fb3342c82e61f5472a71c63d9ed0 upstream.
    
    The Amiga partition parser module uses signed int for partition sector
    address and count, which will overflow for disks larger than 1 TB.
    
    Use u64 as type for sector address and size to allow using disks up to
    2 TB without LBD support, and disks larger than 2 TB with LBD. The RBD
    format allows to specify disk sizes up to 2^128 bytes (though native
    OS limitations reduce this somewhat, to max 2^68 bytes), so check for
    u64 overflow carefully to protect against overflowing sector_t.
    
    This bug was reported originally in 2012, and the fix was created by
    the RDB author, Joanne Dow <jdow@earthlink.net>. A patch had been
    discussed and reviewed on linux-m68k at that time but never officially
    submitted (now resubmitted as patch 1 of this series).
    
    Patch 3 (this series) adds additional error checking and warning
    messages. One of the error checks now makes use of the previously
    unused rdb_CylBlocks field, which causes a 'sparse' warning
    (cast to restricted __be32).
    
    Annotate all 32 bit fields in affs_hardblocks.h as __be32, as the
    on-disk format of RDB and partition blocks is always big endian.

    USB: serial: option: add LARA-R6 01B PIDs
    
    commit ffa5f7a3bf28c1306eef85d4056539c2d4b8eb09 upstream.
    
    The new LARA-R6 product variant identified by the "01B" string can be
    configured (by AT interface) in three different USB modes:
    
    * Default mode (Vendor ID: 0x1546 Product ID: 0x1311) with 4 serial
    interfaces
    
    * RmNet mode (Vendor ID: 0x1546 Product ID: 0x1312) with 4 serial
    interfaces and 1 RmNet virtual network interface
    
    * CDC-ECM mode (Vendor ID: 0x1546 Product ID: 0x1313) with 4 serial
    interface and 1 CDC-ECM virtual network interface
    The first 4 interfaces of all the 3 USB configurations (default, RmNet,
    CDC-ECM) are the same.
    
    In default mode LARA-R6 01B exposes the following interfaces:
    If 0: Diagnostic
    If 1: AT parser
    If 2: AT parser
    If 3: AT parser/alternative functions
    
    In RmNet mode LARA-R6 01B exposes the following interfaces:

    ARC: define ASM_NL and __ALIGN(_STR) outside #ifdef __ASSEMBLY__ guard
    
    [ Upstream commit 92e2921eeafdfca9acd9b83f07d2b7ca099bac24 ]
    
    ASM_NL is useful not only in *.S files but also in .c files for using
    inline assembler in C code.
    
    On ARC, however, ASM_NL is evaluated inconsistently. It is expanded to
    a backquote (`) in *.S files, but a semicolon (;) in *.c files because
    arch/arc/include/asm/linkage.h defines it inside #ifdef __ASSEMBLY__,
    so the definition for C code falls back to the default value defined in
    include/linux/linkage.h.
    
    If ASM_NL is used in inline assembler in .c files, it will result in
    wrong assembly code because a semicolon is not an instruction separator,
    but the start of a comment for ARC.
    
    Move ASM_NL (also __ALIGN and __ALIGN_STR) out of the #ifdef.

    ARCv2: entry: push out the Z flag unclobber from common EXCEPTION_PROLOGUE
    
    [ Upstream commit 23c0cbd0c75c3b564850294427fd2be2bc2a015b ]
    
    Upon a taken interrupt/exception from User mode, HS hardware auto sets Z flag.
    This helps shave a few instructions from EXCEPTION_PROLOGUE by eliding
    re-reading ERSTATUS and some bit fiddling.
    
    However TLB Miss Exception handler can clobber the CPU flags and still end
    up in EXCEPTION_PROLOGUE in the slow path handling TLB handling case:
    
       EV_TLBMissD
         do_slow_path_pf
           EV_TLBProtV (aliased to call_do_page_fault)
              EXCEPTION_PROLOGUE
    
    As a result, EXCEPTION_PROLOGUE need to "unclobber" the Z flag which this
    patch changes. It is now pushed out to TLB Miss Exception handler.
    The reasons beings:
    
     - The flag restoration is only needed for slowpath TLB Miss Exception
       handling, but currently being in EXCEPTION_PROLOGUE penalizes all
       exceptions such as ProtV and syscall Trap, where Z flag is already
       as expected.
    
     - Pushing unclobber out to where it was clobbered is much cleaner and
       also serves to document the fact.
    
     - Makes EXCEPTION_PROLGUE similar to INTERRUPT_PROLOGUE so easier to
       refactor the common parts which is what this series aims to do

    The reference from 'get_bar' to 'foo' seems wrong.
    
    I have no solution for this because it is true in assembly level.
    
    In the following output, relocation at 0x1c is no longer associated
    with 'bar'. The two relocation entries point to the same symbol, and
    the offset to 'bar' is encoded in the instruction 'r0, [r3, #4]'.

      0000001c  00000c02 R_ARM_ABS32       00000000   .init.data
    
    When find_elf_symbol() gets into a situation where relsym->st_name is
    zero, there is no guarantee to get the symbol name as written in C.
    
    I am keeping the current logic because it is useful in many architectures,
    but the symbol name is not always correct depending on the optimization.
    I left some comments in find_tosym().

    hwrng: virtio - Fix race on data_avail and actual data
    
    [ Upstream commit ac52578d6e8d300dd50f790f29a24169b1edd26c ]
    
    The virtio rng device kicks off a new entropy request whenever the
    data available reaches zero.  When a new request occurs at the end
    of a read operation, that is, when the result of that request is
    only needed by the next reader, then there is a race between the
    writing of the new data and the next reader.
    
    This is because there is no synchronisation whatsoever between the
    writer and the reader.
    
    Fix this by writing data_avail with smp_store_release and reading
    it with smp_load_acquire when we first enter read.  The subsequent
    reads are safe because they're either protected by the first load
    acquire, or by the completion mechanism.
    
    Also remove the redundant zeroing of data_idx in random_recv_done
    (data_idx must already be zero at this point) and data_avail in
    request_entropy (ditto).

    hwrng: virtio - don't wait on cleanup
    
    [ Upstream commit 2bb31abdbe55742c89f4dc0cc26fcbc8467364f6 ]
    
    When virtio-rng device was dropped by the hwrng core we were forced
    to wait the buffer to come back from the device to not have
    remaining ongoing operation that could spoil the buffer.
    
    But now, as the buffer is internal to the virtio-rng we can release
    the waiting loop immediately, the buffer will be retrieve and use
    when the virtio-rng driver will be selected again.
    
    This avoids to hang on an rng_current write command if the virtio-rng
    device is blocked by a lack of entropy. This allows to select
    another entropy source if the current one is empty.

    hwrng: virtio - add an internal buffer
    
    [ Upstream commit bf3175bc50a3754dc427e2f5046e17a9fafc8be7 ]
    
    hwrng core uses two buffers that can be mixed in the
    virtio-rng queue.
    
    If the buffer is provided with wait=0 it is enqueued in the
    virtio-rng queue but unused by the caller.
    On the next call, core provides another buffer but the
    first one is filled instead and the new one queued.
    And the caller reads the data from the new one that is not
    updated, and the data in the first one are lost.
    
    To avoid this mix, virtio-rng needs to use its own unique
    internal buffer at a cost of a data copy to the caller buffer.

    IB/hfi1: Fix sdma.h tx->num_descs off-by-one errors
    
    [ Upstream commit fd8958efe8779d3db19c9124fce593ce681ac709 ]
    
    Fix three sources of error involving struct sdma_txreq.num_descs.
    
    When _extend_sdma_tx_descs() extends the descriptor array, it uses the
    value of tx->num_descs to determine how many existing entries from the
    tx's original, internal descriptor array to copy to the newly allocated
    one.  As this value was incremented before the call, the copy loop will
    access one entry past the internal descriptor array, copying its contents
    into the corresponding slot in the new array.
    
    If the call to _extend_sdma_tx_descs() fails, _pad_smda_tx_descs() then
    invokes __sdma_tx_clean() which uses the value of tx->num_desc to drive a
    loop that unmaps all descriptor entries in use.  As this value was
    incremented before the call, the unmap loop will invoke sdma_unmap_desc()
    on a descriptor entry whose contents consist of whatever random data was
    copied into it during (1), leading to cascading further calls into the
    kernel and driver using arbitrary data.
    
    _sdma_close_tx() was using tx->num_descs instead of tx->num_descs - 1.
    
    Fix all of the above by:
    - Only increment .num_descs after .descp is extended.
    - Use .num_descs - 1 instead of .num_descs for last .descp entry.

    Fix build errors in soc/fsl/qe/usb.c when QUICC_ENGINE is not set.
    This happens when PPC_EP88XC is set, which selects CPM1 & CPM.
    When CPM is set, USB_FSL_QE can be set without QUICC_ENGINE
    being set. When USB_FSL_QE is set, QE_USB deafults to y, which
    causes build errors when QUICC_ENGINE is not set. Making
    QE_USB depend on QUICC_ENGINE prevents QE_USB from defaulting to y.
    
    Fixes these build errors:

    ASoC: es8316: Increment max value for ALC Capture Target Volume control
    
    [ Upstream commit 6f073429037cd79d7311cd8236311c53f5ea8f01 ]
    
    The following error occurs when trying to restore a previously saved
    ALSA mixer state (tested on a Rock 5B board):
    
      $ alsactl --no-ucm -f /tmp/asound.state store hw:Analog
      $ alsactl --no-ucm -I -f /tmp/asound.state restore hw:Analog
      alsactl: set_control:1475: Cannot write control '2:0:0:ALC Capture Target Volume:0' : Invalid argument
    
    According to ES8316 datasheet, the register at address 0x2B, which is
    related to the above mixer control, contains by default the value 0xB0.
    Considering the corresponding ALC target bits (ALCLVL) are 7:4, the
    control is initialized with 11, which is one step above the maximum
    value allowed by the driver:
    
     ALCLVL | dB gain
     -------+--------
      0000  |  -16.5
      0001  |  -15.0
      0010  |  -13.5
      ....  |  .....
      0111  |   -6.0
      1000  |   -4.5
      1001  |   -3.0
      1010  |   -1.5
      ....  |  .....
      1111  |   -1.5
    
    The tests performed using the VU meter feature (--vumeter=TYPE) of
    arecord/aplay confirm the specs are correct and there is no measured
    gain if the 1011-1111 range would have been mapped to 0 dB:
    
     dB gain | VU meter %
     --------+-----------
       -6.0  |  30-31
       -4.5  |  35-36
       -3.0  |  42-43
       -1.5  |  50-51
        0.0  |  50-51
    
    Increment the max value allowed for ALC Capture Target Volume control,
    so that it matches the hardware default.  Additionally, update the
    related TLV to prevent an artificial extension of the dB gain range.

    radeon: avoid double free in ci_dpm_init()
    
    [ Upstream commit 20c3dffdccbd494e0dd631d1660aeecbff6775f2 ]
    
    Several calls to ci_dpm_fini() will attempt to free resources that
    either have been freed before or haven't been allocated yet. This
    may lead to undefined or dangerous behaviour.
    
    For instance, if r600_parse_extended_power_table() fails, it might
    call r600_free_extended_power_table() as will ci_dpm_fini() later
    during error handling.
    
    Fix this by only freeing pointers to objects previously allocated.
    
    Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static
    analysis tool SVACE.

    netlink: Add __sock_i_ino() for __netlink_diag_dump().
    
    [ Upstream commit 25a9c8a4431c364f97f75558cb346d2ad3f53fbb ]
    
    syzbot reported a warning in __local_bh_enable_ip(). [0]
    
    Commit 8d61f926d420 ("netlink: fix potential deadlock in
    netlink_set_err()") converted read_lock(&nl_table_lock) to
    read_lock_irqsave() in __netlink_diag_dump() to prevent a deadlock.
    
    However, __netlink_diag_dump() calls sock_i_ino() that uses
    read_lock_bh() and read_unlock_bh().  If CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS=y,
    read_unlock_bh() finally enables IRQ even though it should stay
    disabled until the following read_unlock_irqrestore().
    
    Using read_lock() in sock_i_ino() would trigger a lockdep splat
    in another place that was fixed in commit f064af1e500a ("net: fix
    a lockdep splat"), so let's add __sock_i_ino() that would be safe
    to use under BH disabled.

    ipvlan: Fix return value of ipvlan_queue_xmit()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a9922e7be6d042fa00f894c376473b17a162b66 ]
    
    ipvlan_queue_xmit() should return NET_XMIT_XXX, but
    ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2/l3() returns rx_handler_result_t or NET_RX_XXX
    in some cases. ipvlan_rcv_frame() will only return RX_HANDLER_CONSUMED
    in ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2/l3() because 'local' is true. It's equal to
    NET_XMIT_SUCCESS. But dev_forward_skb() can return NET_RX_SUCCESS or
    NET_RX_DROP, and returning NET_RX_DROP(NET_XMIT_DROP) will increase
    both ipvlan and ipvlan->phy_dev drops counter.
    
    The skb to forward can be treated as xmitted successfully. This patch
    makes ipvlan_queue_xmit() return NET_XMIT_SUCCESS for forward skb.

    [ Upstream commit f188d30087480eab421cd8ca552fb15f55d57f4d ]
    
    ct_sip_parse_numerical_param() returns only 0 or 1 now.
    But process_register_request() and process_register_response() imply
    checking for a negative value if parsing of a numerical header parameter
    failed.
    The invocation in nf_nat_sip() looks correct:
            if (ct_sip_parse_numerical_param(...) > 0 &&
                ...) { ... }
    
    Make the return value of the function ct_sip_parse_numerical_param()
    a tristate to fix all the cases
    a) return 1 if value is found; *val is set
    b) return 0 if value is not found; *val is unchanged
    c) return -1 on error; *val is undefined
    
    Found by InfoTeCS on behalf of Linux Verification Center
    (linuxtesting.org) with SVACE.

    lib/ts_bm: reset initial match offset for every block of text
    
    [ Upstream commit 6f67fbf8192da80c4db01a1800c7fceaca9cf1f9 ]
    
    The `shift` variable which indicates the offset in the string at which
    to start matching the pattern is initialized to `bm->patlen - 1`, but it
    is not reset when a new block is retrieved.  This means the implemen-
    tation may start looking at later and later positions in each successive
    block and miss occurrences of the pattern at the beginning.  E.g.,
    consider a HTTP packet held in a non-linear skb, where the HTTP request
    line occurs in the second block:
    
      [... 52 bytes of packet headers ...]
      GET /bmtest HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.example.com\r\n\r\n
    
    and the pattern is "GET /bmtest".
    
    Once the first block comprising the packet headers has been examined,
    `shift` will be pointing to somewhere near the end of the block, and so
    when the second block is examined the request line at the beginning will
    be missed.
    
    Reinitialize the variable for each new block.

    gtp: Fix use-after-free in __gtp_encap_destroy().
    
    [ Upstream commit ce3aee7114c575fab32a5e9e939d4bbb3dcca79f ]
    
    syzkaller reported use-after-free in __gtp_encap_destroy(). [0]
    
    It shows the same process freed sk and touched it illegally.
    
    Commit e198987e7dd7 ("gtp: fix suspicious RCU usage") added lock_sock()
    and release_sock() in __gtp_encap_destroy() to protect sk->sk_user_data,
    but release_sock() is called after sock_put() releases the last refcnt.

    netlink: fix potential deadlock in netlink_set_err()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8d61f926d42045961e6b65191c09e3678d86a9cf ]
    
    syzbot reported a possible deadlock in netlink_set_err() [1]
    
    A similar issue was fixed in commit 1d482e666b8e ("netlink: disable IRQs
    for netlink_lock_table()") in netlink_lock_table()
    
    This patch adds IRQ safety to netlink_set_err() and __netlink_diag_dump()
    which were not covered by cited commit.
    
    [1]
    
    WARNING: possible irq lock inversion dependency detected

    syz-executor.2/23011 just changed the state of lock:

    but this lock was taken by another, SOFTIRQ-safe lock in the past:
     (&local->queue_stop_reason_lock){..-.}-{2:2}
    
    and interrupts could create inverse lock ordering between them.

    wifi: ath9k: Fix possible stall on ath9k_txq_list_has_key()
    
    [ Upstream commit 75086cc6dee046e3fbb3dba148b376d8802f83bc ]
    
    On EDMA capable hardware, ath9k_txq_list_has_key() can enter infinite
    loop if it is called while all txq_fifos have packets that use different
    key that the one we are looking for. Fix it by exiting the loop if all
    txq_fifos have been checked already.
    
    Because this loop is called under spin_lock_bh() (see ath_txq_lock) it
    causes the following rcu stall:

    kexec: fix a memory leak in crash_shrink_memory()
    
    [ Upstream commit 1cba6c4309f03de570202c46f03df3f73a0d4c82 ]
    
    Patch series "kexec: enable kexec_crash_size to support two crash kernel
    regions".
    
    When crashkernel=X fails to reserve region under 4G, it will fall back to
    reserve region above 4G and a region of the default size will also be
    reserved under 4G.  Unfortunately, /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_size only
    supports one crash kernel region now, the user cannot sense the low memory
    reserved by reading /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_size.  Also, low memory cannot
    be freed by writing this file.
    
    For example:
    resource_size(crashk_res) = 512M
    resource_size(crashk_low_res) = 256M
    
    The result of 'cat /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_size' is 512M, but it should be
    768M.  When we execute 'echo 0 > /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_size', the size
    of crashk_res becomes 0 and resource_size(crashk_low_res) is still 256 MB,
    which is incorrect.
    
    Since crashk_res manages the memory with high address and crashk_low_res
    manages the memory with low address, crashk_low_res is shrunken only when
    all crashk_res is shrunken.  And because when there is only one crash
    kernel region, crashk_res is always used.  Therefore, if all crashk_res is
    shrunken and crashk_low_res still exists, swap them.
    
    This patch (of 6):
    
    If the value of parameter 'new_size' is in the semi-open and semi-closed
    interval (crashk_res.end - KEXEC_CRASH_MEM_ALIGN + 1, crashk_res.end], the
    calculation result of ram_res is:
    
            ram_res->start = crashk_res.end + 1
            ram_res->end   = crashk_res.end
    
    The operation of insert_resource() fails, and ram_res is not added to
    iomem_resource.  As a result, the memory of the control block ram_res is
    leaked.
    
    In fact, on all architectures, the start address and size of crashk_res
    are already aligned by KEXEC_CRASH_MEM_ALIGN.  Therefore, we do not need
    to round up crashk_res.start again.  Instead, we should round up
    'new_size' in advance.

    watchdog/perf: more properly prevent false positives with turbo modes
    
    [ Upstream commit 4379e59fe5665cfda737e45b8bf2f05321ef049c ]
    
    Currently, in the watchdog_overflow_callback() we first check to see if
    the watchdog had been touched and _then_ we handle the workaround for
    turbo mode.  This order should be reversed.
    
    Specifically, "touching" the hardlockup detector's watchdog should avoid
    lockups being detected for one period that should be roughly the same
    regardless of whether we're running turbo or not.  That means that we
    should do the extra accounting for turbo _before_ we look at (and clear)
    the global indicating that we've been touched.
    
    NOTE: this fix is made based on code inspection.  I am not aware of any
    reports where the old code would have generated false positives.  That
    being said, this order seems more correct and also makes it easier down
    the line to share code with the "buddy" hardlockup detector.

    watchdog/perf: define dummy watchdog_update_hrtimer_threshold() on correct config
    
    [ Upstream commit 5e008df11c55228a86a1bae692cc2002503572c9 ]
    
    Patch series "watchdog/hardlockup: Add the buddy hardlockup detector", v5.
    
    This patch series adds the "buddy" hardlockup detector.  In brief, the
    buddy hardlockup detector can detect hardlockups without arch-level
    support by having CPUs checkup on a "buddy" CPU periodically.
    
    Given the new design of this patch series, testing all combinations is
    fairly difficult. I've attempted to make sure that all combinations of
    CONFIG_ options are good, but it wouldn't surprise me if I missed
    something. I apologize in advance and I'll do my best to fix any
    problems that are found.
    
    This patch (of 18):
    
    The real watchdog_update_hrtimer_threshold() is defined in
    kernel/watchdog_hld.c.  That file is included if
    CONFIG_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_PERF and the function is defined in that file
    if CONFIG_HARDLOCKUP_CHECK_TIMESTAMP.
    
    The dummy version of the function in "nmi.h" didn't get that quite right.
    While this doesn't appear to be a huge deal, it's nice to make it
    consistent.
    
    It doesn't break builds because CHECK_TIMESTAMP is only defined by x86 so

    [ Upstream commit e74f562328b03fbe9cf438f958464dff3a644dfc ]
    
    It makes no sense to set MMC_PM_KEEP_POWER in shutdown. The flag
    indicates to the MMC subsystem to keep the slot powered on during
    suspend, but in shutdown the slot should actually be powered off.
    Drop this call.

    Recent work on converting address list to a tree made it obvious
    we need an abstraction around writing netdev->dev_addr. Without
    such abstraction updating the main device address is invisible
    to the core.
    
    Introduce a number of helpers which for now just wrap memcpy()

    nfc: constify several pointers to u8, char and sk_buff
    
    [ Upstream commit 3df40eb3a2ea58bf404a38f15a7a2768e4762cb0 ]
    
    Several functions receive pointers to u8, char or sk_buff but do not
    modify the contents so make them const.  This allows doing the same for
    local variables and in total makes the code a little bit safer.

    wifi: ath9k: avoid referencing uninit memory in ath9k_wmi_ctrl_rx
    
    [ Upstream commit f24292e827088bba8de7158501ac25a59b064953 ]
    
    For the reasons also described in commit b383e8abed41 ("wifi: ath9k: avoid
    uninit memory read in ath9k_htc_rx_msg()"), ath9k_htc_rx_msg() should
    validate pkt_len before accessing the SKB.
    
    For example, the obtained SKB may have been badly constructed with
    pkt_len = 8. In this case, the SKB can only contain a valid htc_frame_hdr
    but after being processed in ath9k_htc_rx_msg() and passed to
    ath9k_wmi_ctrl_rx() endpoint RX handler, it is expected to have a WMI
    command header which should be located inside its data payload.
    
    Implement sanity checking inside ath9k_wmi_ctrl_rx(). Otherwise, uninit
    memory can be referenced.

    [ Upstream commit 2ae6aaf76912bae53c74b191569d2ab484f24bf3 ]
    
    When removing a disk with replacement, the replacement will be used to
    replace rdev. During this process, there is a brief window in which both
    rdev and replacement are read as NULL in raid10_write_request(). This
    will result in io not being submitted but it should be.
    
      //remove                              //write

    treewide: Remove uninitialized_var() usage
    
    commit 3f649ab728cda8038259d8f14492fe400fbab911 upstream.
    
    Using uninitialized_var() is dangerous as it papers over real bugs[1]
    (or can in the future), and suppresses unrelated compiler warnings
    (e.g. "unused variable"). If the compiler thinks it is uninitialized,
    either simply initialize the variable or make compiler changes.
    
    In preparation for removing[2] the[3] macro[4], remove all remaining
    needless uses with the following script:
    
    git grep '\buninitialized_var\b' | cut -d: -f1 | sort -u | \
            xargs perl -pi -e \
                    's/\buninitialized_var\(([^\)]+)\)/\1/g;
                     s:\s*/\* (GCC be quiet|to make compiler happy) \*/$::g;'
    
    drivers/video/fbdev/riva/riva_hw.c was manually tweaked to avoid
    pathological white-space.
    
    No outstanding warnings were found building allmodconfig with GCC 9.3.0
    for x86_64, i386, arm64, arm, powerpc, powerpc64le, s390x, mips, sparc64,
    alpha, and m68k.

    scripts/tags.sh: Resolve gtags empty index generation
    
    commit e1b37563caffc410bb4b55f153ccb14dede66815 upstream.
    
    gtags considers any file outside of its current working directory
    "outside the source tree" and refuses to index it. For O= kernel builds,
    or when "make" is invoked from a directory other then the kernel source
    tree, gtags ignores the entire kernel source and generates an empty
    index.
    
    Force-set gtags current working directory to the kernel source tree.
    
    Due to commit 9da0763bdd82 ("kbuild: Use relative path when building in
    a subdir of the source tree"), if the kernel build is done in a
    sub-directory of the kernel source tree, the kernel Makefile will set
    the kernel's $srctree to ".." for shorter compile-time and run-time
    warnings. Consequently, the list of files to be indexed will be in the
    "../*" form, rendering all such paths invalid once gtags switches to the
    kernel source tree as its current working directory.
    
    If gtags indexing is requested and the build directory is not the kernel
    source tree, index all files in absolute-path form.
    
    Note, indexing in absolute-path form will not affect the generated
    index, as paths in gtags indices are always relative to the gtags "root
    directory" anyway (as evidenced by "gtags --dump").

    drm/edid: Fix uninitialized variable in drm_cvt_modes()
    
    commit 991fcb77f490390bcad89fa67d95763c58cdc04c upstream.
    
    Noticed this when trying to compile with -Wall on a kernel fork. We
    potentially don't set width here, which causes the compiler to complain
    about width potentially being uninitialized in drm_cvt_modes(). So, let's
    fix that.
    
    Changes since v1:
    * Don't emit an error as this code isn't reachable, just mark it as such
    Changes since v2:
    * Remove now unused variable

    fbdev: imsttfb: Fix use after free bug in imsttfb_probe
    
    commit c75f5a55061091030a13fef71b9995b89bc86213 upstream.
    
    A use-after-free bug may occur if init_imstt invokes framebuffer_release
    and free the info ptr. The caller, imsttfb_probe didn't notice that and
    still keep the ptr as private data in pdev.
    
    If we remove the driver which will call imsttfb_remove to make cleanup,
    UAF happens.
    
    Fix it by return error code if bad case happens in init_imstt.

    video: imsttfb: check for ioremap() failures
    
    commit 13b7c0390a5d3840e1e2cda8f44a310fdbb982de upstream.
    
    We should check if ioremap() were to somehow fail in imsttfb_probe() and
    handle the unwinding of the resources allocated here properly.
    
    Ideally if anyone cares about this driver (it's for a PowerMac era PCI
    display card), they wouldn't even be using fbdev anymore.  Or the devm_*
    apis could be used, but that's just extra work for diminishing
    returns...

    x86/smp: Use dedicated cache-line for mwait_play_dead()
    
    commit f9c9987bf52f4e42e940ae217333ebb5a4c3b506 upstream.
    
    Monitoring idletask::thread_info::flags in mwait_play_dead() has been an
    obvious choice as all what is needed is a cache line which is not written
    by other CPUs.
    
    But there is a use case where a "dead" CPU needs to be brought out of
    MWAIT: kexec().
    
    This is required as kexec() can overwrite text, pagetables, stacks and the
    monitored cacheline of the original kernel. The latter causes MWAIT to
    resume execution which obviously causes havoc on the kexec kernel which
    results usually in triple faults.
    
    Use a dedicated per CPU storage to prepare for that.

    gfs2: Don't deref jdesc in evict
    
    commit 504a10d9e46bc37b23d0a1ae2f28973c8516e636 upstream.
    
    On corrupt gfs2 file systems the evict code can try to reference the
    journal descriptor structure, jdesc, after it has been freed and set to
    NULL. The sequence of events is:
    
    init_journal()
    ...
    fail_jindex:
       gfs2_jindex_free(sdp); <------frees journals, sets jdesc = NULL
          if (gfs2_holder_initialized(&ji_gh))
             gfs2_glock_dq_uninit(&ji_gh);
    fail:
       iput(sdp->sd_jindex); <--references jdesc in evict_linked_inode
          evict()
             gfs2_evict_inode()
                evict_linked_inode()
                   ret = gfs2_trans_begin(sdp, 0, sdp->sd_jdesc->jd_blocks);
    <------references the now freed/zeroed sd_jdesc pointer.
    
    The call to gfs2_trans_begin is done because the truncate_inode_pages
    call can cause gfs2 events that require a transaction, such as removing
    journaled data (jdata) blocks from the journal.
    
    This patch fixes the problem by adding a check for sdp->sd_jdesc to
    function gfs2_evict_inode. In theory, this should only happen to corrupt
    gfs2 file systems, when gfs2 detects the problem, reports it, then tries
    to evict all the system inodes it has read in up to that point.
