    can: rcar_canfd: rcar_canfd_handle_global_receive(): fix IRQ storm on global FIFO receive
    
    commit 702de2c21eed04c67cefaaedc248ef16e5f6b293 upstream.
    
    We are seeing an IRQ storm on the global receive IRQ line under heavy
    CAN bus load conditions with both CAN channels enabled.
    
    Conditions:
    
    The global receive IRQ line is shared between can0 and can1, either of
    the channels can trigger interrupt while the other channel's IRQ line
    is disabled (RFIE).
    
    When global a receive IRQ interrupt occurs, we mask the interrupt in
    the IRQ handler. Clearing and unmasking of the interrupt is happening
    in rx_poll(). There is a race condition where rx_poll() unmasks the
    interrupt, but the next IRQ handler does not mask the IRQ due to
    NAPIF_STATE_MISSED flag (e.g.: can0 RX FIFO interrupt is disabled and
    can1 is triggering RX interrupt, the delay in rx_poll() processing
    results in setting NAPIF_STATE_MISSED flag) leading to an IRQ storm.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by checking IRQ active and enabled before
    handling the IRQ on a particular channel.

    net/mlx5e: Do not increment ESN when updating IPsec ESN state
    
    [ Upstream commit 888be6b279b7257b5f6e4c9527675bff0a335596 ]
    
    An offloaded SA stops receiving after about 2^32 + replay_window
    packets. For example, when SA reaches <seq-hi 0x1, seq 0x2c>, all
    subsequent packets get dropped with SA-icv-failure (integrity_failed).
    
    To reproduce the bug:
    - ConnectX-6 Dx with crypto enabled (FW 22.30.1004)
    - ipsec.conf:
      nic-offload = yes
      replay-window = 32
      esn = yes
      salifetime=24h
    - Run netperf for a long time to send more than 2^32 packets
      netperf -H <device-under-test> -t TCP_STREAM -l 20000
    
    When 2^32 + replay_window packets are received, the replay window
    moves from the 2nd half of subspace (overlap=1) to the 1st half
    (overlap=0). The driver then updates the 'esn' value in NIC
    (i.e. seq_hi) as follows.
    
     seq_hi = xfrm_replay_seqhi(seq_bottom)
     new esn in NIC = seq_hi + 1
    
    The +1 increment is wrong, as seq_hi already contains the correct
    seq_hi. For example, when seq_hi=1, the driver actually tells NIC to
    use seq_hi=2 (esn). This incorrect esn value causes all subsequent
    packets to fail integrity checks (SA-icv-failure). So, do not
    increment.

    i40e: Fix VF hang when reset is triggered on another VF
    
    [ Upstream commit 52424f974bc53c26ba3f00300a00e9de9afcd972 ]
    
    When a reset was triggered on one VF with i40e_reset_vf
    global PF state __I40E_VF_DISABLE was set on a PF until
    the reset finished. If immediately after triggering reset
    on one VF there is a request to reset on another
    it will cause a hang on VF side because VF will be notified
    of incoming reset but the reset will never happen because
    of this global state, we will get such error message:
    
    [  +4.890195] iavf 0000:86:02.1: Never saw reset
    
    and VF will hang waiting for the reset to be triggered.
    
    Fix this by introducing new VF state I40E_VF_STATE_RESETTING
    that will be set on a VF if it is currently resetting instead of
    the global __I40E_VF_DISABLE PF state.

    adds put_clock() in mpc5xxx_can_remove() function, forgetting to add

    Fix this bug by adding put_clock() in the error handling code.

    tcp: fix indefinite deferral of RTO with SACK reneging
    
    [ Upstream commit 3d2af9cce3133b3bc596a9d065c6f9d93419ccfb ]
    
    This commit fixes a bug that can cause a TCP data sender to repeatedly
    defer RTOs when encountering SACK reneging.
    
    The bug is that when we're in fast recovery in a scenario with SACK
    reneging, every time we get an ACK we call tcp_check_sack_reneging()
    and it can note the apparent SACK reneging and rearm the RTO timer for
    srtt/2 into the future. In some SACK reneging scenarios that can
    happen repeatedly until the receive window fills up, at which point
    the sender can't send any more, the ACKs stop arriving, and the RTO
    fires at srtt/2 after the last ACK. But that can take far too long
    (O(10 secs)), since the connection is stuck in fast recovery with a
    low cwnd that cannot grow beyond ssthresh, even if more bandwidth is
    available.
    
    This fix changes the logic in tcp_check_sack_reneging() to only rearm
    the RTO timer if data is cumulatively ACKed, indicating forward
    progress. This avoids this kind of nearly infinite loop of RTO timer
    re-arming. In addition, this meets the goals of
    tcp_check_sack_reneging() in handling Windows TCP behavior that looks
    temporarily like SACK reneging but is not really.
    
    Many thanks to Jakub Kicinski and Neil Spring, who reported this issue
    and provided critical packet traces that enabled root-causing this
    issue. Also, many thanks to Jakub Kicinski for testing this fix.

    net: fix UAF issue in nfqnl_nf_hook_drop() when ops_init() failed
    
    [ Upstream commit d266935ac43d57586e311a087510fe6a084af742 ]
    
    When the ops_init() interface is invoked to initialize the net, but
    ops->init() fails, data is released. However, the ptr pointer in
    net->gen is invalid. In this case, when nfqnl_nf_hook_drop() is invoked
    to release the net, invalid address access occurs.
    
    The process is as follows:
    setup_net()
            ops_init()
                    data = kzalloc(...)   ---> alloc "data"
                    net_assign_generic()  ---> assign "date" to ptr in net->gen
                    ...
                    ops->init()           ---> failed
                    ...
                    kfree(data);          ---> ptr in net->gen is invalid
            ...
            ops_exit_list()
                    ...
                    nfqnl_nf_hook_drop()
                            *q = nfnl_queue_pernet(net) ---> q is invalid

    The current XGBE code assumes that offset 6 of EEPROM SFP DAC (passive)
    cables is NULL. However, some cables (the 5 meter and 7 meter Molex
    passive cables) have non-zero data at offset 6. Fix the logic by moving
    the passive cable check above the active checks, so as not to be
    improperly identified as an active cable. This will fix the issue for
    any passive cable that advertises 1000Base-CX in offset 6.

    This happens when the compiled code for show_stack() has a single word
    on the stack, and doesn't use a tail call to show_stack_log_lvl().
    (CONFIG_GCOV_PROFILE_ALL=y is the only known case of this.)  Then the
    __unwind_start() skip logic hits an off-by-one bug and fails to unwind
    all the way to the intended starting frame.
    
    Fix it by reverting the following commit:
    
      f1d9a2abff66 ("x86/unwind/orc: Don't skip the first frame for inactive tasks")
    
    The original justification for that commit no longer exists.  That
    original issue was later fixed in a different way, with the following

    It was caused by srv->listener that might be set to null by

    tipc_topsrv_accept() worker.
    
    srv->listener is protected by srv->idr_lock in tipc_topsrv_stop(), so add
    a check for srv->listener under srv->idr_lock in tipc_topsrv_accept() to
    avoid the null-ptr-deref. To ensure the lsock is not released during the
    tipc_topsrv_accept(), move sock_release() after tipc_topsrv_work_stop()
    where it's waiting until the tipc_topsrv_accept worker to be done.
    
    Note that sk_callback_lock is used to protect sk->sk_user_data instead of
    srv->listener, and it should check srv in tipc_topsrv_listener_data_ready()
    instead. This also ensures that no more tipc_topsrv_accept worker will be
    started after tipc_conn_close() is called in tipc_topsrv_stop() where it
    sets sk->sk_user_data to null.

    [ Upstream commit 0b33a33bd15d5bab73b87152b220a8d0153a4587 ]
    
    The mode_valid field in drm_connector_helper_funcs is expected to be of
    type:
    enum drm_mode_status (* mode_valid) (struct drm_connector *connector,
                                         struct drm_display_mode *mode);
    
    The mismatched return type breaks forward edge kCFI since the underlying
    function definition does not match the function hook definition.
    
    The return type of mdp4_lvds_connector_mode_valid should be changed from
    int to enum drm_mode_status.

    xen/gntdev: Prevent leaking grants
    
    commit 0991028cd49567d7016d1b224fe0117c35059f86 upstream.
    
    Prior to this commit, if a grant mapping operation failed partially,
    some of the entries in the map_ops array would be invalid, whereas all
    of the entries in the kmap_ops array would be valid. This in turn would
    cause the following logic in gntdev_map_grant_pages to become invalid:
    
      for (i = 0; i < map->count; i++) {
        if (map->map_ops[i].status == GNTST_okay) {
          map->unmap_ops[i].handle = map->map_ops[i].handle;
          if (!use_ptemod)
            alloced++;
        }
        if (use_ptemod) {
          if (map->kmap_ops[i].status == GNTST_okay) {
            if (map->map_ops[i].status == GNTST_okay)
              alloced++;
            map->kunmap_ops[i].handle = map->kmap_ops[i].handle;
          }
        }
      }
      ...
      atomic_add(alloced, &map->live_grants);
    
    Assume that use_ptemod is true (i.e., the domain mapping the granted
    pages is a paravirtualized domain). In the code excerpt above, note that
    the "alloced" variable is only incremented when both kmap_ops[i].status
    and map_ops[i].status are set to GNTST_okay (i.e., both mapping
    operations are successful).  However, as also noted above, there are
    cases where a grant mapping operation fails partially, breaking the
    assumption of the code excerpt above.
    
    The aforementioned causes map->live_grants to be incorrectly set. In
    some cases, all of the map_ops mappings fail, but all of the kmap_ops
    mappings succeed, meaning that live_grants may remain zero. This in turn
    makes it impossible to unmap the successfully grant-mapped pages pointed
    to by kmap_ops, because unmap_grant_pages has the following snippet of
    code at its beginning:
    
      if (atomic_read(&map->live_grants) == 0)
        return; /* Nothing to do */
    
    In other cases where only some of the map_ops mappings fail but all
    kmap_ops mappings succeed, live_grants is made positive, but when the
    user requests unmapping the grant-mapped pages, __unmap_grant_pages_done
    will then make map->live_grants negative, because the latter function
    does not check if all of the pages that were requested to be unmapped
    were actually unmapped, and the same function unconditionally subtracts
    "data->count" (i.e., a value that can be greater than map->live_grants)
    from map->live_grants. The side effects of a negative live_grants value
    have not been studied.
    
    The net effect of all of this is that grant references are leaked in one
    of the above conditions. In Qubes OS v4.1 (which uses Xen's grant
    mechanism extensively for X11 GUI isolation), this issue manifests
    itself with warning messages like the following to be printed out by the
    Linux kernel in the VM that had granted pages (that contain X11 GUI
    window data) to dom0: "g.e. 0x1234 still pending", especially after the
    user rapidly resizes GUI VM windows (causing some grant-mapping
    operations to partially or completely fail, due to the fact that the VM
    unshares some of the pages as part of the window resizing, making the
    pages impossible to grant-map from dom0).
    
    The fix for this issue involves counting all successful map_ops and
    kmap_ops mappings separately, and then adding the sum to live_grants.
    During unmapping, only the number of successfully unmapped grants is
    subtracted from live_grants. The code is also modified to check for
    negative live_grants values after the subtraction and warn the user.

    kernfs: fix use-after-free in __kernfs_remove
    
    commit 4abc99652812a2ddf932f137515d5c5a04723538 upstream.
    
    Syzkaller managed to trigger concurrent calls to
    kernfs_remove_by_name_ns() for the same file resulting in
    a KASAN detected use-after-free. The race occurs when the root
    node is freed during kernfs_drain().
    
    To prevent this acquire an additional reference for the root
    of the tree that is removed before calling __kernfs_remove().
    
    Found by syzkaller with the following reproducer (slab_nomerge is
    required):
    
    syz_mount_image$ext4(0x0, &(0x7f0000000100)='./file0\x00', 0x100000, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)

    mmc: core: Fix kernel panic when remove non-standard SDIO card
    
    commit 9972e6b404884adae9eec7463e30d9b3c9a70b18 upstream.
    
    SDIO tuple is only allocated for standard SDIO card, especially it causes
    memory corruption issues when the non-standard SDIO card has removed, which
    is because the card device's reference counter does not increase for it at
    sdio_init_func(), but all SDIO card device reference counter gets decreased
    at sdio_release_func().

    mac802154: Fix LQI recording
    
    commit 5a5c4e06fd03b595542d5590f2bc05a6b7fc5c2b upstream.
    
    Back in 2014, the LQI was saved in the skb control buffer (skb->cb, or
    mac_cb(skb)) without any actual reset of this area prior to its use.
    
    As part of a useful rework of the use of this region, 32edc40ae65c
    ("ieee802154: change _cb handling slightly") introduced mac_cb_init() to
    basically memset the cb field to 0. In particular, this new function got
    called at the beginning of mac802154_parse_frame_start(), right before
    the location where the buffer got actually filled.
    
    What went through unnoticed however, is the fact that the very first
    helper called by device drivers in the receive path already used this
    area to save the LQI value for later extraction. Resetting the cb field
    "so late" led to systematically zeroing the LQI.
    
    If we consider the reset of the cb field needed, we can make it as soon
    as we get an skb from a device driver, right before storing the LQI,
    as is the very first time we need to write something there.

    commit cc67482c9e5f2c80d62f623bcc347c29f9f648e1 upstream.
    
    Several types of UAFs can occur when physically removing a USB device.
    
    Adds ufx_ops_destroy() function to .fb_destroy of fb_ops, and
    in this function, there is kref_put() that finally calls ufx_free().
    
    This fix prevents multiple UAFs.

    commit 72b2aa38191bcba28389b0e20bf6b4f15017ff2b upstream.
    
    The iio_utils uses a digit calculation in order to know length of the
    file name containing a buffer number. The digit calculation does not
    work for number 0.
    
    This leads to allocation of one character too small buffer for the
    file-name when file name contains value '0'. (Eg. buffer0).
    
    Fix digit calculation by returning one digit to be present for number
    '0'.

    xhci: Remove device endpoints from bandwidth list when freeing the device
    
    commit 5aed5b7c2430ce318a8e62f752f181e66f0d1053 upstream.
    
    Endpoints are normally deleted from the bandwidth list when they are
    dropped, before the virt device is freed.
    
    If xHC host is dying or being removed then the endpoints aren't dropped
    cleanly due to functions returning early to avoid interacting with a
    non-accessible host controller.
    
    So check and delete endpoints that are still on the bandwidth list when
    freeing the virt device.
    
    Solves a list_del corruption kernel crash when unbinding xhci-pci,
    caused by xhci_mem_cleanup() when it later tried to delete already freed
    endpoints from the bandwidth list.
    
    This only affects hosts that use software bandwidth checking, which
    currenty is only the xHC in intel Panther Point PCH (Ivy Bridge)

    commit f78961f8380b940e0cfc7e549336c21a2ad44f4d upstream.
    
    When servicing a transfer completion event, the dwc3 driver will reclaim
    TRBs of started requests up to the request associated with the interrupt
    event. Currently we don't check for interrupt due to missed isoc, and
    the driver may attempt to reclaim TRBs beyond the associated event. This
    causes invalid memory access when the hardware still owns the TRB. If
    there's a missed isoc TRB with IMI (interrupt on missed isoc), make sure
    to stop servicing further.
    
    Note that only the last TRB of chained TRBs has its status updated with
    missed isoc.

    USB: add RESET_RESUME quirk for NVIDIA Jetson devices in RCM
    
    commit fc4ade55c617dc73c7e9756b57f3230b4ff24540 upstream.
    
    NVIDIA Jetson devices in Force Recovery mode (RCM) do not support
    suspending, ie. flashing fails if the device has been suspended. The
    devices are still visible in lsusb and seem to work otherwise, making
    the issue hard to debug. This has been discovered in various forum
    posts, eg. [1].
    
    The patch has been tested on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, but I'm adding
    all the Jetson models listed in [2] on the assumption that they all
    behave similarly.

    ALSA: au88x0: use explicitly signed char
    
    commit ee03c0f200eb0d9f22dd8732d9fb7956d91019c2 upstream.
    
    With char becoming unsigned by default, and with `char` alone being
    ambiguous and based on architecture, signed chars need to be marked
    explicitly as such. This fixes warnings like:
    
    sound/pci/au88x0/au88x0_core.c:2029 vortex_adb_checkinout() warn: signedness bug returning '(-22)'
    sound/pci/au88x0/au88x0_core.c:2046 vortex_adb_checkinout() warn: signedness bug returning '(-12)'
    sound/pci/au88x0/au88x0_core.c:2125 vortex_adb_allocroute() warn: 'vortex_adb_checkinout(vortex, (0), en, 0)' is unsigned
    sound/pci/au88x0/au88x0_core.c:2170 vortex_adb_allocroute() warn: 'vortex_adb_checkinout(vortex, stream->resources, en, 4)' is unsigned
    
    As well, since one function returns errnos, return an `int` rather than
    a `signed char`.

    ALSA: Use del_timer_sync() before freeing timer
    
    commit f0a868788fcbf63cdab51f5adcf73b271ede8164 upstream.
    
    The current code for freeing the emux timer is extremely dangerous:
    
      CPU0                          CPU1
      ----                          ----
    snd_emux_timer_callback()
                                snd_emux_free()
                                  spin_lock(&emu->voice_lock)
                                  del_timer(&emu->tlist); <-- returns immediately
                                  spin_unlock(&emu->voice_lock);
                                  [..]
                                  kfree(emu);
    
      spin_lock(&emu->voice_lock);
    
     [BOOM!]
    
    Instead just use del_timer_sync() which will wait for the timer to finish
    before continuing. No need to check if the timer is active or not when
    doing so.
    
    This doesn't fix the race of a possible re-arming of the timer, but at
    least it won't use the data that has just been freed.

    can: kvaser_usb: Fix possible completions during init_completion
    
    commit 2871edb32f4622c3a25ce4b3977bad9050b91974 upstream.
    
    kvaser_usb uses completions to signal when a response event is received
    for outgoing commands.
    
    However, it uses init_completion() to reinitialize the start_comp and
    stop_comp completions before sending the start/stop commands.
    
    In case the device sends the corresponding response just before the
    actual command is sent, complete() may be called concurrently with
    init_completion() which is not safe.
    
    This might be triggerable even with a properly functioning device by
    stopping the interface (CMD_STOP_CHIP) just after it goes bus-off (which
    also causes the driver to send CMD_STOP_CHIP when restart-ms is off),
    but that was not tested.
    
    Fix the issue by using reinit_completion() instead.

    ACPI: video: Force backlight native for more TongFang devices
    
    commit 3dbc80a3e4c55c4a5b89ef207bed7b7de36157b4 upstream.
    
    This commit is very different from the upstream commit! It fixes the same
    issue by adding more quirks, rather then the general fix from the 6.1
    kernel, because the general fix from the 6.1 kernel is part of a larger
    refactoring of the backlight code which is not suitable for the stable
    series.
    
    As described in "ACPI: video: Drop NL5x?U, PF4NU1F and PF5?U??
    acpi_backlight=native quirks" (10212754a0d2) the upstream commit "ACPI:
    video: Make backlight class device registration a separate step (v2)"
    (3dbc80a3e4c5) makes these quirks unnecessary. However as mentioned in this
    bugtracker ticket https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=215683#c17
    the upstream fix is part of a larger patchset that is overall too complex
    for stable.
    
    The TongFang GKxNRxx, GMxNGxx, GMxZGxx, and GMxRGxx / TUXEDO
    Stellaris/Polaris Gen 1-4, have the same problem as the Clevo NL5xRU and
    NL5xNU / TUXEDO Aura 15 Gen1 and Gen2:
    They have a working native and video interface for screen backlight.
    However the default detection mechanism first registers the video interface
    before unregistering it again and switching to the native interface during
    boot. This results in a dangling SBIOS request for backlight change for
    some reason, causing the backlight to switch to ~2% once per boot on the
    first power cord connect or disconnect event. Setting the native interface
    explicitly circumvents this buggy behaviour by avoiding the unregistering
    process.

    media: v4l2-mem2mem: Apply DST_QUEUE_OFF_BASE on MMAP buffers across ioctls
    
    commit 8310ca94075e784bbb06593cd6c068ee6b6e4ca6 upstream.
    
    DST_QUEUE_OFF_BASE is applied to offset/mem_offset on MMAP capture buffers
    only for the VIDIOC_QUERYBUF ioctl, while the userspace fields (including
    offset/mem_offset) are filled in for VIDIOC_{QUERY,PREPARE,Q,DQ}BUF
    ioctls. This leads to differences in the values presented to userspace.
    If userspace attempts to mmap the capture buffer directly using values
    from DQBUF, it will fail.
    
    Move the code that applies the magic offset into a helper, and call
    that helper from all four ioctl entry points.

    iommu/vt-d: Clean up si_domain in the init_dmars() error path
    
    [ Upstream commit 620bf9f981365c18cc2766c53d92bf8131c63f32 ]
    
    A splat from kmem_cache_destroy() was seen with a kernel prior to
    commit ee2653bbe89d ("iommu/vt-d: Remove domain and devinfo mempool")
    when there was a failure in init_dmars(), because the iommu_domain
    cache still had objects. While the mempool code is now gone, there
    still is a leak of the si_domain memory if init_dmars() fails. So
    clean up si_domain in the init_dmars() error path.

    net: sched: cake: fix null pointer access issue when cake_init() fails
    
    [ Upstream commit 51f9a8921ceacd7bf0d3f47fa867a64988ba1dcb ]
    
    When the default qdisc is cake, if the qdisc of dev_queue fails to be
    inited during mqprio_init(), cake_reset() is invoked to clear
    resources. In this case, the tins is NULL, and it will cause gpf issue.
    
    The process is as follows:
    qdisc_create_dflt()
            cake_init()
                    q->tins = kvcalloc(...)        --->failed, q->tins is NULL
            ...
            qdisc_put()
                    ...
                    cake_reset()
                            ...
                            cake_dequeue_one()
                                    b = &q->tins[...]   --->q->tins is NULL

    invoked recursively for each part.
    
    However, after processing each part, the BTN_MOUSE status is updated,
    sending multiple click events. [1]

    btrfs: fix processing of delayed tree block refs during backref walking
    
    [ Upstream commit 943553ef9b51db303ab2b955c1025261abfdf6fb ]
    
    During backref walking, when processing a delayed reference with a type of
    BTRFS_TREE_BLOCK_REF_KEY, we have two bugs there:
    
    1) We are accessing the delayed references extent_op, and its key, without
       the protection of the delayed ref head's lock;
    
    2) If there's no extent op for the delayed ref head, we end up with an
       uninitialized key in the stack, variable 'tmp_op_key', and then pass
       it to add_indirect_ref(), which adds the reference to the indirect
       refs rb tree.
    
       This is wrong, because indirect references should have a NULL key
       when we don't have access to the key, and in that case they should be
       added to the indirect_missing_keys rb tree and not to the indirect rb
       tree.
    
       This means that if have BTRFS_TREE_BLOCK_REF_KEY delayed ref resulting
       from freeing an extent buffer, therefore with a count of -1, it will
       not cancel out the corresponding reference we have in the extent tree
       (with a count of 1), since both references end up in different rb
       trees.
    
       When using fiemap, where we often need to check if extents are shared
       through shared subtrees resulting from snapshots, it means we can
       incorrectly report an extent as shared when it's no longer shared.
       However this is temporary because after the transaction is committed
       the extent is no longer reported as shared, as running the delayed
       reference results in deleting the tree block reference from the extent
       tree.
    
       Outside the fiemap context, the result is unpredictable, as the key was
       not initialized but it's used when navigating the rb trees to insert
       and search for references (prelim_ref_compare()), and we expect all
       references in the indirect rb tree to have valid keys.
    
    The following reproducer triggers the second bug:
    
       $ cat test.sh
       #!/bin/bash
    
       DEV=/dev/sdj

       btrfs subvolume snapshot $MNT $MNT/snap
    
       # Fiemap should output 0x2008 in the flags column.
       # 0x2000 means shared extent
       # 0x8 means encoded extent (because it's compressed)
       echo
       echo "fiemap after snapshot, range [120M, 120M + 128K):"
       xfs_io -c "fiemap -v 120M 128K" $MNT/foo
       echo
    
       # Overwrite one extent and fsync to flush delalloc and COW a new path
       # in the snapshot's tree.
       #
       # After this we have a BTRFS_DROP_DELAYED_REF delayed ref of type
       # BTRFS_TREE_BLOCK_REF_KEY with a count of -1 for every COWed extent
       # buffer in the path.
       #
       # In the extent tree we have inline references of type
       # BTRFS_TREE_BLOCK_REF_KEY, with a count of 1, for the same extent
       # buffers, so they should cancel each other, and the extent buffers in
       # the fs tree should no longer be considered as shared.
       #

       echo "fiemap after overwrite range [120M, 120M + 128K):"

    Now the extent is not reported as shared anymore.
    
    So fix this by passing a NULL key pointer to add_indirect_ref() when
    processing a delayed reference for a tree block if there's no extent op
    for our delayed ref head with a defined key. Also access the extent op
    only after locking the delayed ref head's lock.
    
    The reproducer will be converted later to a test case for fstests.

    btrfs: fix processing of delayed data refs during backref walking
    
    [ Upstream commit 4fc7b57228243d09c0d878873bf24fa64a90fa01 ]
    
    When processing delayed data references during backref walking and we are
    using a share context (we are being called through fiemap), whenever we
    find a delayed data reference for an inode different from the one we are
    interested in, then we immediately exit and consider the data extent as
    shared. This is wrong, because:
    
    1) This might be a DROP reference that will cancel out a reference in the
       extent tree;
    
    2) Even if it's an ADD reference, it may be followed by a DROP reference
       that cancels it out.
    
    In either case we should not exit immediately.
    
    Fix this by never exiting when we find a delayed data reference for
    another inode - instead add the reference and if it does not cancel out
    other delayed reference, we will exit early when we call
    extent_is_shared() after processing all delayed references. If we find
    a drop reference, then signal the code that processes references from
    the extent tree (add_inline_refs() and add_keyed_refs()) to not exit
    immediately if it finds there a reference for another inode, since we
    have delayed drop references that may cancel it out. In this later case
    we exit once we don't have references in the rb trees that cancel out
    each other and have two references for different inodes.
    
    Example reproducer for case 1):
    
       $ cat test-1.sh
       #!/bin/bash
    
       DEV=/dev/sdj
       MNT=/mnt/sdj
    
       mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
       mount $DEV $MNT

       cp --reflink=always $MNT/foo $MNT/bar

       echo "fiemap after removing file bar:"
       xfs_io -c "fiemap -v" $MNT/foo
    
       umount $MNT
    
    Running it before this patch, the extent is still listed as shared, it has
    the flag 0x2000 (FIEMAP_EXTENT_SHARED) set:
    
       $ ./test-1.sh
       fiemap after cloning:

          0: [0..127]:        26624..26751       128 0x2001
    
    Example reproducer for case 2):
    
       $ cat test-2.sh
       #!/bin/bash
    
       DEV=/dev/sdj

       cp --reflink=always $MNT/foo $MNT/bar
    
       # Flush delayed references to the extent tree and commit current
       # transaction.
       sync
    
       echo
       echo "fiemap after cloning:"
       xfs_io -c "fiemap -v" $MNT/foo

       echo
       echo "fiemap after removing file bar:"
       xfs_io -c "fiemap -v" $MNT/foo
    
       umount $MNT
    
    Running it before this patch, the extent is still listed as shared, it has
    the flag 0x2000 (FIEMAP_EXTENT_SHARED) set:
    
       $ ./test-2.sh

    r8152: add PID for the Lenovo OneLink+ Dock
    
    commit 1bd3a383075c64d638e65d263c9267b08ee7733c upstream.
    
    The Lenovo OneLink+ Dock contains an RTL8153 controller that behaves as
    a broken CDC device by default. Add the custom Lenovo PID to the r8152
    driver to support it properly.
    
    Also, systems compatible with this dock provide a BIOS option to enable
    MAC address passthrough (as per Lenovo document "ThinkPad Docking
    Solutions 2017"). Add the custom PID to the MAC passthrough list too.
    
    Tested on a ThinkPad 13 1st gen with the expected results:
    
    passthrough disabled: Invalid header when reading pass-thru MAC addr
    passthrough enabled:  Using pass-thru MAC addr XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

    arm64: errata: Remove AES hwcap for COMPAT tasks
    
    commit 44b3834b2eed595af07021b1c64e6f9bc396398b upstream.
    
    Cortex-A57 and Cortex-A72 have an erratum where an interrupt that
    occurs between a pair of AES instructions in aarch32 mode may corrupt
    the ELR. The task will subsequently produce the wrong AES result.
    
    The AES instructions are part of the cryptographic extensions, which are
    optional. User-space software will detect the support for these
    instructions from the hwcaps. If the platform doesn't support these
    instructions a software implementation should be used.
    
    Remove the hwcap bits on affected parts to indicate user-space should
    not use the AES instructions.

    Debugging the decoder on msm8916 I noticed the vdec probe was crashing if
    the fmt pointer was NULL.
    
    A similar fix from Colin Ian King found by Coverity was implemented for the
    encoder. Implement the same fix on the decoder.

    KVM: arm64: vgic: Fix exit condition in scan_its_table()
    
    commit c000a2607145d28b06c697f968491372ea56c23a upstream.
    
    With some PCIe topologies, restoring a guest fails while
    parsing the ITS device tables.
    
    Reproducer hints:
    1. Create ARM virt VM with pxb-pcie bus which adds
       extra host bridges, with qemu command like:
    
    ```
      -device pxb-pcie,bus_nr=8,id=pci.x,numa_node=0,bus=pcie.0 \
      -device pcie-root-port,..,bus=pci.x \
      ...
      -device pxb-pcie,bus_nr=37,id=pci.y,numa_node=1,bus=pcie.0 \
      -device pcie-root-port,..,bus=pci.y \
      ...
    
    ```
    2. Ensure the guest uses 2-level device table
    3. Perform VM migration which calls save/restore device tables
    
    In that setup, we get a big "offset" between 2 device_ids,
    which makes unsigned "len" round up a big positive number,
    causing the scan loop to continue with a bad GPA. For example:
    
    1. L1 table has 2 entries;
    2. and we are now scanning at L2 table entry index 2075 (pointed
       to by L1 first entry)
    3. if next device id is 9472, we will get a big offset: 7397;
    4. with unsigned 'len', 'len -= offset * esz', len will underflow to a
       positive number, mistakenly into next iteration with a bad GPA;
       (It should break out of the current L2 table scanning, and jump
       into the next L1 table entry)
    5. that bad GPA fails the guest read.
    
    Fix it by stopping the L2 table scan when the next device id is
    outside of the current table, allowing the scan to continue from
    the next L1 table entry.
    
    Thanks to Eric Auger for the fix suggestion.

    This happens because sata_pmp_init_links() initialize link->pmp up to
    SATA_PMP_MAX_PORTS while em_priv is declared as 8 elements array.
    
    I can't find the maximum Enclosure Management ports specified in AHCI
    spec v1.3.1, but "12.2.1 LED message type" states that "Port Multiplier
    Information" can utilize 4 bits, which implies it can support up to 16
    ports. Hence, use SATA_PMP_MAX_PORTS as EM_MAX_SLOTS to resolve the
    issue.

    ata: ahci-imx: Fix MODULE_ALIAS
    
    commit 979556f1521a835a059de3b117b9c6c6642c7d58 upstream.
    
    'ahci:' is an invalid prefix, preventing the module from autoloading.
    Fix this by using the 'platform:' prefix and DRV_NAME.

    hwmon/coretemp: Handle large core ID value
    
    commit 7108b80a542b9d65e44b36d64a700a83658c0b73 upstream.
    
    The coretemp driver supports up to a hard-coded limit of 128 cores.
    
    Today, the driver can not support a core with an ID above that limit.
    Yet, the encoding of core ID's is arbitrary (BIOS APIC-ID) and so they
    may be sparse and they may be large.
    
    Update the driver to map arbitrary core ID numbers into appropriate
    array indexes so that 128 cores can be supported, no matter the encoding
    of core ID's.

    x86/microcode/AMD: Apply the patch early on every logical thread
    
    commit e7ad18d1169c62e6c78c01ff693fd362d9d65278 upstream.
    
    Currently, the patch application logic checks whether the revision
    needs to be applied on each logical CPU (SMT thread). Therefore, on SMT
    designs where the microcode engine is shared between the two threads,
    the application happens only on one of them as that is enough to update
    the shared microcode engine.
    
    However, there are microcode patches which do per-thread modification,
    see Link tag below.
    
    Therefore, drop the revision check and try applying on each thread. This
    is what the BIOS does too so this method is very much tested.
    
    Btw, change only the early paths. On the late loading paths, there's no
    point in doing per-thread modification because if is it some case like
    in the bugzilla below - removing a CPUID flag - the kernel cannot go and
    un-use features it has detected are there early. For that, one should
    use early loading anyway.
    
      [ bp: Fixes does not contain the oldest commit which did check for
        equality but that is good enough. ]

    ocfs2: fix BUG when iput after ocfs2_mknod fails
    
    commit 759a7c6126eef5635506453e9b9d55a6a3ac2084 upstream.
    
    Commit b1529a41f777 "ocfs2: should reclaim the inode if
    '__ocfs2_mknod_locked' returns an error" tried to reclaim the claimed
    inode if __ocfs2_mknod_locked() fails later.  But this introduce a race,
    the freed bit may be reused immediately by another thread, which will
    update dinode, e.g.  i_generation.  Then iput this inode will lead to BUG:
    inode->i_generation != le32_to_cpu(fe->i_generation)
    
    We could make this inode as bad, but we did want to do operations like
    wipe in some cases.  Since the claimed inode bit can only affect that an
    dinode is missing and will return back after fsck, it seems not a big
    problem.  So just leave it as is by revert the reclaim logic.

    ocfs2: clear dinode links count in case of error
    
    commit 28f4821b1b53e0649706912e810c6c232fc506f9 upstream.
    
    In ocfs2_mknod(), if error occurs after dinode successfully allocated,
    ocfs2 i_links_count will not be 0.
    
    So even though we clear inode i_nlink before iput in error handling, it
    still won't wipe inode since we'll refresh inode from dinode during inode
    lock.  So just like clear inode i_nlink, we clear ocfs2 i_links_count as
    well.  Also do the same change for ocfs2_symlink().
