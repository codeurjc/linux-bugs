    bpf: Enlarge offset check value to INT_MAX in bpf_skb_{load,store}_bytes
    
    commit 45969b4152c1752089351cd6836a42a566d49bcf upstream.
    
    The data length of skb frags + frag_list may be greater than 0xffff, and
    skb_header_pointer can not handle negative offset. So, here INT_MAX is used
    to check the validity of offset. Add the same change to the related function
    skb_store_bytes.

    NFSD: Fix possible sleep during nfsd4_release_lockowner()
    
    commit ce3c4ad7f4ce5db7b4f08a1e237d8dd94b39180b upstream.
    
    nfsd4_release_lockowner() holds clp->cl_lock when it calls
    check_for_locks(). However, check_for_locks() calls nfsd_file_get()
    / nfsd_file_put() to access the backing inode's flc_posix list, and
    nfsd_file_put() can sleep if the inode was recently removed.
    
    Let's instead rely on the stateowner's reference count to gate
    whether the release is permitted. This should be a reliable
    indication of locks-in-use since file lock operations and
    ->lm_get_owner take appropriate references, which are released
    appropriately when file locks are removed.

    raid5: introduce MD_BROKEN
    
    commit 57668f0a4cc4083a120cc8c517ca0055c4543b59 upstream.
    
    Raid456 module had allowed to achieve failed state. It was fixed by
    fb73b357fb9 ("raid5: block failing device if raid will be failed").
    This fix introduces a bug, now if raid5 fails during IO, it may result
    with a hung task without completion. Faulty flag on the device is
    necessary to process all requests and is checked many times, mainly in
    analyze_stripe().
    Allow to set faulty on drive again and set MD_BROKEN if raid is failed.
    
    As a result, this level is allowed to achieve failed state again, but
    communication with userspace (via -EBUSY status) will be preserved.
    
    This restores possibility to fail array via #mdadm --set-faulty command
    and will be fixed by additional verification on mdadm side.
    
    Reproduction steps:
     mdadm -CR imsm -e imsm -n 3 /dev/nvme[0-2]n1
     mdadm -CR r5 -e imsm -l5 -n3 /dev/nvme[0-2]n1 --assume-clean

    dm crypt: make printing of the key constant-time
    
    commit 567dd8f34560fa221a6343729474536aa7ede4fd upstream.
    
    The device mapper dm-crypt target is using scnprintf("%02x", cc->key[i]) to
    report the current key to userspace. However, this is not a constant-time
    operation and it may leak information about the key via timing, via cache
    access patterns or via the branch predictor.
    
    Change dm-crypt's key printing to use "%c" instead of "%02x". Also
    introduce hex2asc() that carefully avoids any branching or memory
    accesses when converting a number in the range 0 ... 15 to an ascii
    character.

    zsmalloc: fix races between asynchronous zspage free and page migration
    
    commit 2505a981114dcb715f8977b8433f7540854851d8 upstream.
    
    The asynchronous zspage free worker tries to lock a zspage's entire page
    list without defending against page migration.  Since pages which haven't
    yet been locked can concurrently migrate off the zspage page list while
    lock_zspage() churns away, lock_zspage() can suffer from a few different
    lethal races.
    
    It can lock a page which no longer belongs to the zspage and unsafely
    dereference page_private(), it can unsafely dereference a torn pointer to
    the next page (since there's a data race), and it can observe a spurious
    NULL pointer to the next page and thus not lock all of the zspage's pages
    (since a single page migration will reconstruct the entire page list, and
    create_page_chain() unconditionally zeroes out each list pointer in the
    process).
    
    Fix the races by using migrate_read_lock() in lock_zspage() to synchronize
    with page migration.

    exec: Force single empty string when argv is empty
    
    commit dcd46d897adb70d63e025f175a00a89797d31a43 upstream.
    
    Quoting[1] Ariadne Conill:
    
    "In several other operating systems, it is a hard requirement that the
    second argument to execve(2) be the name of a program, thus prohibiting
    a scenario where argc < 1. POSIX 2017 also recommends this behaviour,
    but it is not an explicit requirement[2]:
    
        The argument arg0 should point to a filename string that is
        associated with the process being started by one of the exec
        functions.
    ...
    Interestingly, Michael Kerrisk opened an issue about this in 2008[3],
    but there was no consensus to support fixing this issue then.
    Hopefully now that CVE-2021-4034 shows practical exploitative use[4]
    of this bug in a shellcode, we can reconsider.
    
    This issue is being tracked in the KSPP issue tracker[5]."
    
    While the initial code searches[6][7] turned up what appeared to be
    mostly corner case tests, trying to that just reject argv == NULL
    (or an immediately terminated pointer list) quickly started tripping[8]
    existing userspace programs.
    
    The next best approach is forcing a single empty string into argv and
    adjusting argc to match. The number of programs depending on argc == 0
    seems a smaller set than those calling execve with a NULL argv.
    
    Account for the additional stack space in bprm_stack_limits(). Inject an
    empty string when argc == 0 (and set argc = 1). Warn about the case so
    userspace has some notice about the change:
    
        process './argc0' launched './argc0' with NULL argv: empty string added
    
    Additionally WARN() and reject NULL argv usage for kernel threads.

    drm/i915: Fix -Wstringop-overflow warning in call to intel_read_wm_latency()
    
    commit 336feb502a715909a8136eb6a62a83d7268a353b upstream.
    
    Fix the following -Wstringop-overflow warnings when building with GCC-11:
    
    drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_pm.c:3106:9: warning: ‘intel_read_wm_latency’ accessing 16 bytes in a region of size 10 [-Wstringop-overflow=]
     3106 |         intel_read_wm_latency(dev_priv, dev_priv->wm.pri_latency);
          |         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_pm.c:3106:9: note: referencing argument 2 of type ‘u16 *’ {aka ‘short unsigned int *’}
    drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_pm.c:2861:13: note: in a call to function ‘intel_read_wm_latency’
     2861 | static void intel_read_wm_latency(struct drm_i915_private *dev_priv,
          |             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    by removing the over-specified array size from the argument declarations.
    
    It seems that this code is actually safe because the size of the
    array depends on the hardware generation, and the function checks
    for that.
    
    Notice that wm can be an array of 5 elements:
    drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_pm.c:3109:   intel_read_wm_latency(dev_priv, dev_priv->wm.pri_latency);
    
    or an array of 8 elements:
    drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_pm.c:3131:   intel_read_wm_latency(dev_priv, dev_priv->wm.skl_latency);
    
    and the compiler legitimately complains about that.
    
    This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable
    -Wstringop-overflow.

    We used to set regulatory info before the registration of
    the device and then the regulatory info didn't get set, because
    the device isn't registered so there isn't a device to set the
    regulatory info for. So set the regulatory info after the device
    registration.
    Call reg_process_self_managed_hints() once again after the device
    registration because it does nothing before it.

    assoc_array: Fix BUG_ON during garbage collect
    
    commit d1dc87763f406d4e67caf16dbe438a5647692395 upstream.
    
    A rare BUG_ON triggered in assoc_array_gc:
    
        [3430308.818153] kernel BUG at lib/assoc_array.c:1609!
    
    Which corresponded to the statement currently at line 1593 upstream:
    
        BUG_ON(assoc_array_ptr_is_meta(p));
    
    Using the data from the core dump, I was able to generate a userspace
    reproducer[1] and determine the cause of the bug.
    
    [1]: https://github.com/brenns10/kernel_stuff/tree/master/assoc_array_gc
    
    After running the iterator on the entire branch, an internal tree node
    looked like the following:
    
        NODE (nr_leaves_on_branch: 3)
          SLOT [0] NODE (2 leaves)
          SLOT [1] NODE (1 leaf)
          SLOT [2..f] NODE (empty)
    
    In the userspace reproducer, the pr_devel output when compressing this
    node was:
    
        -- compress node 0x5607cc089380 --
        free=0, leaves=0
        [0] retain node 2/1 [nx 0]
        [1] fold node 1/1 [nx 0]
        [2] fold node 0/1 [nx 2]
        [3] fold node 0/2 [nx 2]
        [4] fold node 0/3 [nx 2]
        [5] fold node 0/4 [nx 2]
        [6] fold node 0/5 [nx 2]
        [7] fold node 0/6 [nx 2]
        [8] fold node 0/7 [nx 2]
        [9] fold node 0/8 [nx 2]
        [10] fold node 0/9 [nx 2]
        [11] fold node 0/10 [nx 2]
        [12] fold node 0/11 [nx 2]
        [13] fold node 0/12 [nx 2]
        [14] fold node 0/13 [nx 2]
        [15] fold node 0/14 [nx 2]
        after: 3
    
    At slot 0, an internal node with 2 leaves could not be folded into the
    node, because there was only one available slot (slot 0). Thus, the
    internal node was retained. At slot 1, the node had one leaf, and was
    able to be folded in successfully. The remaining nodes had no leaves,
    and so were removed. By the end of the compression stage, there were 14
    free slots, and only 3 leaf nodes. The tree was ascended and then its
    parent node was compressed. When this node was seen, it could not be
    folded, due to the internal node it contained.
    
    The invariant for compression in this function is: whenever
    nr_leaves_on_branch < ASSOC_ARRAY_FAN_OUT, the node should contain all
    leaf nodes. The compression step currently cannot guarantee this, given
    the corner case shown above.
    
    To fix this issue, retry compression whenever we have retained a node,
    and yet nr_leaves_on_branch < ASSOC_ARRAY_FAN_OUT. This second
    compression will then allow the node in slot 1 to be folded in,
    satisfying the invariant. Below is the output of the reproducer once the
    fix is applied:
    
        -- compress node 0x560e9c562380 --
        free=0, leaves=0
        [0] retain node 2/1 [nx 0]
        [1] fold node 1/1 [nx 0]
        [2] fold node 0/1 [nx 2]
        [3] fold node 0/2 [nx 2]
        [4] fold node 0/3 [nx 2]
        [5] fold node 0/4 [nx 2]
        [6] fold node 0/5 [nx 2]
        [7] fold node 0/6 [nx 2]
        [8] fold node 0/7 [nx 2]
        [9] fold node 0/8 [nx 2]
        [10] fold node 0/9 [nx 2]
        [11] fold node 0/10 [nx 2]
        [12] fold node 0/11 [nx 2]
        [13] fold node 0/12 [nx 2]
        [14] fold node 0/13 [nx 2]
        [15] fold node 0/14 [nx 2]
        internal nodes remain despite enough space, retrying
        -- compress node 0x560e9c562380 --
        free=14, leaves=1
        [0] fold node 2/15 [nx 0]

    i2c: ismt: Provide a DMA buffer for Interrupt Cause Logging
    
    [ Upstream commit 17a0f3acdc6ec8b89ad40f6e22165a4beee25663 ]
    
    Before sending a MSI the hardware writes information pertinent to the
    interrupt cause to a memory location pointed by SMTICL register. This
    memory holds three double words where the least significant bit tells
    whether the interrupt cause of master/target/error is valid. The driver
    does not use this but we need to set it up because otherwise it will
    perform DMA write to the default address (0) and this will cause an
    IOMMU fault such as below:
    
      DMAR: DRHD: handling fault status reg 2
      DMAR: [DMA Write] Request device [00:12.0] PASID ffffffff fault addr 0
            [fault reason 05] PTE Write access is not set
    
    To prevent this from happening, provide a proper DMA buffer for this
    that then gets mapped by the IOMMU accordingly.

    net: ftgmac100: Disable hardware checksum on AST2600
    
    [ Upstream commit 6fd45e79e8b93b8d22fb8fe22c32fbad7e9190bd ]
    
    The AST2600 when using the i210 NIC over NC-SI has been observed to
    produce incorrect checksum results with specific MTU values. This was
    first observed when sending data across a long distance set of networks.
    
    On a local network, the following test was performed using a 1MB file of
    random data.
    
    On the receiver run this script:
    
     #!/bin/bash
     while [ 1 ]; do
            # Zero the stats
            nstat -r  > /dev/null
            nc -l 9899 > test-file
            # Check for checksum errors
            TcpInCsumErrors=$(nstat | grep TcpInCsumErrors)
            if [ -z "$TcpInCsumErrors" ]; then
                    echo No TcpInCsumErrors
            else
                    echo TcpInCsumErrors = $TcpInCsumErrors
            fi
     done
    
    On an AST2600 system:
    
     # nc <IP of  receiver host> 9899 < test-file
    
    The test was repeated with various MTU values:
    
     # ip link set mtu 1410 dev eth0
    
    The observed results:
    
     1500 - good
     1434 - bad
     1400 - good
     1410 - bad
     1420 - good
    
    The test was repeated after disabling tx checksumming:
    
     # ethtool -K eth0 tx-checksumming off
    
    And all MTU values tested resulted in transfers without error.
    
    An issue with the driver cannot be ruled out, however there has been no
    bug discovered so far.
    
    David has done the work to take the original bug report of slow data
    transfer between long distance connections and triaged it down to this
    test case.
    
    The vendor suspects this this is a hardware issue when using NC-SI. The
    fixes line refers to the patch that introduced AST2600 support.

    ACPI: sysfs: Fix BERT error region memory mapping
    
    commit 1bbc21785b7336619fb6a67f1fff5afdaf229acc upstream.
    
    Currently the sysfs interface maps the BERT error region as "memory"
    (through acpi_os_map_memory()) in order to copy the error records into
    memory buffers through memory operations (eg memory_read_from_buffer()).
    
    The OS system cannot detect whether the BERT error region is part of
    system RAM or it is "device memory" (eg BMC memory) and therefore it
    cannot detect which memory attributes the bus to memory support (and
    corresponding kernel mapping, unless firmware provides the required
    information).
    
    The acpi_os_map_memory() arch backend implementation determines the
    mapping attributes. On arm64, if the BERT error region is not present in
    the EFI memory map, the error region is mapped as device-nGnRnE; this
    triggers alignment faults since memcpy unaligned accesses are not
    allowed in device-nGnRnE regions.
    
    The ACPI sysfs code cannot therefore map by default the BERT error
    region with memory semantics but should use a safer default.
    
    Change the sysfs code to map the BERT error region as MMIO (through
    acpi_os_map_iomem()) and use the memcpy_fromio() interface to read the
    error region into the kernel buffer.

    ACPI: sysfs: Make sparse happy about address space in use
    
    commit bdd56d7d8931e842775d2e5b93d426a8d1940e33 upstream.
    
    Sparse is not happy about address space in use in acpi_data_show():
    
    drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:428:14: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different address spaces)
    drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:428:14:    expected void [noderef] __iomem *base
    drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:428:14:    got void *
    drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:431:59: warning: incorrect type in argument 4 (different address spaces)
    drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:431:59:    expected void const *from
    drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:431:59:    got void [noderef] __iomem *base
    drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:433:30: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)
    drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:433:30:    expected void *logical_address
    drivers/acpi/sysfs.c:433:30:    got void [noderef] __iomem *base
    
    Indeed, acpi_os_map_memory() returns a void pointer with dropped specific
    address space. Hence, we don't need to carry out __iomem in acpi_data_show().

    secure_seq: use the 64 bits of the siphash for port offset calculation
    
    commit b2d057560b8107c633b39aabe517ff9d93f285e3 upstream.
    
    SipHash replaced MD5 in secure_ipv{4,6}_port_ephemeral() via commit
    7cd23e5300c1 ("secure_seq: use SipHash in place of MD5"), but the output
    remained truncated to 32-bit only. In order to exploit more bits from the
    hash, let's make the functions return the full 64-bit of siphash_3u32().
    We also make sure the port offset calculation in __inet_hash_connect()
    remains done on 32-bit to avoid the need for div_u64_rem() and an extra
    cost on 32-bit systems.

    tcp: change source port randomizarion at connect() time
    
    commit 190cc82489f46f9d88e73c81a47e14f80a791e1a upstream.
    
    RFC 6056 (Recommendations for Transport-Protocol Port Randomization)
    provides good summary of why source selection needs extra care.
    
    David Dworken reminded us that linux implements Algorithm 3
    as described in RFC 6056 3.3.3
    
    Quoting David :
       In the context of the web, this creates an interesting info leak where
       websites can count how many TCP connections a user's computer is
       establishing over time. For example, this allows a website to count
       exactly how many subresources a third party website loaded.
       This also allows:
       - Distinguishing between different users behind a VPN based on
           distinct source port ranges.
       - Tracking users over time across multiple networks.
       - Covert communication channels between different browsers/browser
           profiles running on the same computer
       - Tracking what applications are running on a computer based on
           the pattern of how fast source ports are getting incremented.
    
    Section 3.3.4 describes an enhancement, that reduces
    attackers ability to use the basic information currently
    stored into the shared 'u32 hint'.
    
    This change also decreases collision rate when
    multiple applications need to connect() to
    different destinations.

    Input: goodix - fix spurious key release events
    
    commit 24ef83f6e31d20fc121a7cd732b04b498475fca3 upstream.
    
    The goodix panel sends spurious interrupts after a 'finger up' event,
    which always cause a timeout.
    We were exiting the interrupt handler by reporting touch_num == 0, but
    this was still processed as valid and caused the code to use the
    uninitialised point_data, creating spurious key release events.
    
    Report an error from the interrupt handler so as to avoid processing
    invalid point_data further.

    x86/pci/xen: Disable PCI/MSI[-X] masking for XEN_HVM guests
    
    commit 7e0815b3e09986d2fe651199363e135b9358132a upstream.
    
    When a XEN_HVM guest uses the XEN PIRQ/Eventchannel mechanism, then
    PCI/MSI[-X] masking is solely controlled by the hypervisor, but contrary to
    XEN_PV guests this does not disable PCI/MSI[-X] masking in the PCI/MSI
    layer.
    
    This can lead to a situation where the PCI/MSI layer masks an MSI[-X]
    interrupt and the hypervisor grants the write despite the fact that it
    already requested the interrupt. As a consequence interrupt delivery on the
    affected device is not happening ever.
    
    Set pci_msi_ignore_mask to prevent that like it's done for XEN_PV guests
    already.

    lockdown: also lock down previous kgdb use
    
    commit eadb2f47a3ced5c64b23b90fd2a3463f63726066 upstream.
    
    KGDB and KDB allow read and write access to kernel memory, and thus
    should be restricted during lockdown.  An attacker with access to a
    serial port (for example, via a hypervisor console, which some cloud
    vendors provide over the network) could trigger the debugger so it is
    important that the debugger respect the lockdown mode when/if it is
    triggered.
    
    Fix this by integrating lockdown into kdb's existing permissions
    mechanism.  Unfortunately kgdb does not have any permissions mechanism
    (although it certainly could be added later) so, for now, kgdb is simply
    and brutally disabled by immediately exiting the gdb stub without taking
    any action.
    
    For lockdowns established early in the boot (e.g. the normal case) then
    this should be fine but on systems where kgdb has set breakpoints before
    the lockdown is enacted than "bad things" will happen.
