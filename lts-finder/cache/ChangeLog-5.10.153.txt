    serial: Deassert Transmit Enable on probe in driver-specific way
    
    commit 7c7f9bc986e698873b489c371a08f206979d06b7 upstream.
    
    When a UART port is newly registered, uart_configure_port() seeks to
    deassert RS485 Transmit Enable by setting the RTS bit in port->mctrl.
    However a number of UART drivers interpret a set RTS bit as *assertion*
    instead of deassertion:  Affected drivers include those using
    serial8250_em485_config() (except 8250_bcm2835aux.c) and some using
    mctrl_gpio (e.g. imx.c).
    
    Since the interpretation of the RTS bit is driver-specific, it is not
    suitable as a means to centrally deassert Transmit Enable in the serial
    core.  Instead, the serial core must call on drivers to deassert it in
    their driver-specific way.  One way to achieve that is to call
    ->rs485_config().  It implicitly deasserts Transmit Enable.
    
    So amend uart_configure_port() and uart_resume_port() to invoke
    uart_rs485_config().  That allows removing calls to uart_rs485_config()
    from drivers' ->probe() hooks and declaring the function static.
    
    Skip any invocation of ->set_mctrl() if RS485 is enabled.  RS485 has no
    hardware flow control, so the modem control lines are irrelevant and
    need not be touched.  When leaving RS485 mode, reset the modem control
    lines to the state stored in port->mctrl.  That way, UARTs which are
    muxed between RS485 and RS232 transceivers drive the lines correctly
    when switched to RS232.  (serial8250_do_startup() historically raises
    the OUT1 modem signal because otherwise interrupts are not signaled on
    ancient PC UARTs, but I believe that no longer applies to modern,
    RS485-capable UARTs and is thus safe to be skipped.)
    
    imx.c modifies port->mctrl whenever Transmit Enable is asserted and
    deasserted.  Stop it from doing that so port->mctrl reflects the RS232
    line state.
    
    8250_omap.c deasserts Transmit Enable on ->runtime_resume() by calling
    ->set_mctrl().  Because that is now a no-op in RS485 mode, amend the
    function to call serial8250_em485_stop_tx().
    
    fsl_lpuart.c retrieves and applies the RS485 device tree properties
    after registering the UART port.  Because applying now happens on
    registration in uart_configure_port(), move retrieval of the properties
    ahead of uart_add_one_port().

    serial: core: move RS485 configuration tasks from drivers into core
    
    commit 0ed12afa5655512ee418047fb3546d229df20aa1 upstream.
    
    Several drivers that support setting the RS485 configuration via userspace
    implement one or more of the following tasks:
    
    - in case of an invalid RTS configuration (both RTS after send and RTS on
      send set or both unset) fall back to enable RTS on send and disable RTS
      after send
    
    - nullify the padding field of the returned serial_rs485 struct
    
    - copy the configuration into the uart port struct
    
    - limit RTS delays to 100 ms
    
    Move these tasks into the serial core to make them generic and to provide
    a consistent behaviour among all drivers.

    can: rcar_canfd: rcar_canfd_handle_global_receive(): fix IRQ storm on global FIFO receive
    
    commit 702de2c21eed04c67cefaaedc248ef16e5f6b293 upstream.
    
    We are seeing an IRQ storm on the global receive IRQ line under heavy
    CAN bus load conditions with both CAN channels enabled.
    
    Conditions:
    
    The global receive IRQ line is shared between can0 and can1, either of
    the channels can trigger interrupt while the other channel's IRQ line
    is disabled (RFIE).
    
    When global a receive IRQ interrupt occurs, we mask the interrupt in
    the IRQ handler. Clearing and unmasking of the interrupt is happening
    in rx_poll(). There is a race condition where rx_poll() unmasks the
    interrupt, but the next IRQ handler does not mask the IRQ due to
    NAPIF_STATE_MISSED flag (e.g.: can0 RX FIFO interrupt is disabled and
    can1 is triggering RX interrupt, the delay in rx_poll() processing
    results in setting NAPIF_STATE_MISSED flag) leading to an IRQ storm.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by checking IRQ active and enabled before
    handling the IRQ on a particular channel.

    arm64/kexec: Test page size support with new TGRAN range values

    This just changes system_supports_[4|16|64]kb_granule() helpers to perform
    similar range tests as well. While here, it standardizes page size specific

    arm64/mm: Fix __enable_mmu() for new TGRAN range values
    
    commit 26f55386f964cefa92ab7ccbed68f1a313074215 upstream.
    
    As per ARM ARM DDI 0487G.a, when FEAT_LPA2 is implemented, ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1
    might contain a range of values to describe supported translation granules
    (4K and 16K pages sizes in particular) instead of just enabled or disabled
    values. This changes __enable_mmu() function to handle complete acceptable
    range of values (depending on whether the field is signed or unsigned) now
    represented with ID_AA64MMFR0_TGRAN_SUPPORTED_[MIN..MAX] pair. While here,
    also fix similar situations in EFI stub and KVM as well.

    scsi: sd: Revert "scsi: sd: Remove a local variable"
    
    This reverts commit 84f7a9de0602704bbec774a6c7f7c8c4994bee9c.
    
    Because it introduces a problem that rq->__data_len is set to the wrong
    value.
    
    before the patch:
    1) nr_bytes = rq->__data_len
    2) rq->__data_len = sdp->sector_size
    3) scsi_init_io()
    4) rq->__data_len = nr_bytes
    
    after the patch:
    1) rq->__data_len = sdp->sector_size
    2) scsi_init_io()
    3) rq->__data_len = rq->__data_len -> __data_len is wrong
    
    It will cause that io can only complete one segment each time, and the io
    will requeue in scsi_io_completion_action(), which will cause severe
    performance degradation.
    
    Scsi write same is removed in commit e383e16e84e9 ("scsi: sd: Remove
    WRITE_SAME support") from mainline, hence this patch is only needed for
    stable kernels.

    net: enetc: survive memory pressure without crashing
    
    [ Upstream commit 84ce1ca3fe9e1249bf21176ff162200f1c4e5ed1 ]
    
    Under memory pressure, enetc_refill_rx_ring() may fail, and when called
    during the enetc_open() -> enetc_setup_rxbdr() procedure, this is not
    checked for.
    
    An extreme case of memory pressure will result in exactly zero buffers
    being allocated for the RX ring, and in such a case it is expected that
    hardware drops all RX packets due to lack of buffers.
    
    This does not happen, because the reset-default value of the consumer
    and produces index is 0, and this makes the ENETC think that all buffers
    have been initialized and that it owns them (when in reality none were).
    
    The hardware guide explains this best:
    
    | Configure the receive ring producer index register RBaPIR with a value
    | of 0. The producer index is initially configured by software but owned
    | by hardware after the ring has been enabled. Hardware increments the
    | index when a frame is received which may consume one or more BDs.
    | Hardware is not allowed to increment the producer index to match the
    | consumer index since it is used to indicate an empty condition. The ring
    | can hold at most RBLENR[LENGTH]-1 received BDs.
    |
    | Configure the receive ring consumer index register RBaCIR. The
    | consumer index is owned by software and updated during operation of the
    | of the BD ring by software, to indicate that any receive data occupied
    | in the BD has been processed and it has been prepared for new data.
    | - If consumer index and producer index are initialized to the same
    |   value, it indicates that all BDs in the ring have been prepared and
    |   hardware owns all of the entries.
    | - If consumer index is initialized to producer index plus N, it would
    |   indicate N BDs have been prepared. Note that hardware cannot start if
    |   only a single buffer is prepared due to the restrictions described in
    |   (2).
    | - Software may write consumer index to match producer index anytime
    |   while the ring is operational to indicate all received BDs prior have
    |   been processed and new BDs prepared for hardware.
    
    Normally, the value of rx_ring->rcir (consumer index) is brought in sync
    with the rx_ring->next_to_use software index, but this only happens if
    page allocation ever succeeded.
    
    When PI==CI==0, the hardware appears to receive frames and write them to
    DMA address 0x0 (?!), then set the READY bit in the BD.
    
    The enetc_clean_rx_ring() function (and its XDP derivative) is naturally
    not prepared to handle such a condition. It will attempt to process
    those frames using the rx_swbd structure associated with index i of the
    RX ring, but that structure is not fully initialized (enetc_new_page()
    does all of that). So what happens next is undefined behavior.
    
    To operate using no buffer, we must initialize the CI to PI + 1, which
    will block the hardware from advancing the CI any further, and drop
    everything.
    
    The issue was seen while adding support for zero-copy AF_XDP sockets,
    where buffer memory comes from user space, which can even decide to
    supply no buffers at all (example: "xdpsock --txonly"). However, the bug
    is present also with the network stack code, even though it would take a
    very determined person to trigger a page allocation failure at the
    perfect time (a series of ifup/ifdown under memory pressure should
    eventually reproduce it given enough retries).

    net/mlx5: Fix possible use-after-free in async command interface
    
    [ Upstream commit bacd22df95147ed673bec4692ab2d4d585935241 ]
    
    mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx should return only after all its callback
    handlers were completed. Before this patch, the below race between
    mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx and mlx5_cmd_exec_cb_handler was possible and
    lead to a use-after-free:
    
    1. mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx is called while num_inflight is 2 (i.e.
       elevated by 1, a single inflight callback).
    2. mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx decreases num_inflight to 1.
    3. mlx5_cmd_exec_cb_handler is called, decreases num_inflight to 0 and
       is about to call wake_up().
    4. mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx calls wait_event, which returns
       immediately as the condition (num_inflight == 0) holds.
    5. mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx returns.
    6. The caller of mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx frees the mlx5_async_ctx
       object.
    7. mlx5_cmd_exec_cb_handler goes on and calls wake_up() on the freed
       object.
    
    Fix it by syncing using a completion object. Mark it completed when
    num_inflight reaches 0.

    net/mlx5e: Do not increment ESN when updating IPsec ESN state
    
    [ Upstream commit 888be6b279b7257b5f6e4c9527675bff0a335596 ]
    
    An offloaded SA stops receiving after about 2^32 + replay_window
    packets. For example, when SA reaches <seq-hi 0x1, seq 0x2c>, all
    subsequent packets get dropped with SA-icv-failure (integrity_failed).
    
    To reproduce the bug:
    - ConnectX-6 Dx with crypto enabled (FW 22.30.1004)
    - ipsec.conf:
      nic-offload = yes
      replay-window = 32
      esn = yes
      salifetime=24h
    - Run netperf for a long time to send more than 2^32 packets
      netperf -H <device-under-test> -t TCP_STREAM -l 20000
    
    When 2^32 + replay_window packets are received, the replay window
    moves from the 2nd half of subspace (overlap=1) to the 1st half
    (overlap=0). The driver then updates the 'esn' value in NIC
    (i.e. seq_hi) as follows.
    
     seq_hi = xfrm_replay_seqhi(seq_bottom)
     new esn in NIC = seq_hi + 1
    
    The +1 increment is wrong, as seq_hi already contains the correct
    seq_hi. For example, when seq_hi=1, the driver actually tells NIC to
    use seq_hi=2 (esn). This incorrect esn value causes all subsequent
    packets to fail integrity checks (SA-icv-failure). So, do not
    increment.

    nh: fix scope used to find saddr when adding non gw nh
    
    [ Upstream commit bac0f937c343d651874f83b265ca8f5070ed4f06 ]
    
    As explained by Julian, fib_nh_scope is related to fib_nh_gw4, but
    fib_info_update_nhc_saddr() needs the scope of the route, which is
    the scope "before" fib_nh_scope, ie fib_nh_scope - 1.

    i40e: Fix VF hang when reset is triggered on another VF
    
    [ Upstream commit 52424f974bc53c26ba3f00300a00e9de9afcd972 ]
    
    When a reset was triggered on one VF with i40e_reset_vf
    global PF state __I40E_VF_DISABLE was set on a PF until
    the reset finished. If immediately after triggering reset
    on one VF there is a request to reset on another
    it will cause a hang on VF side because VF will be notified
    of incoming reset but the reset will never happen because
    of this global state, we will get such error message:
    
    [  +4.890195] iavf 0000:86:02.1: Never saw reset
    
    and VF will hang waiting for the reset to be triggered.
    
    Fix this by introducing new VF state I40E_VF_STATE_RESETTING
    that will be set on a VF if it is currently resetting instead of
    the global __I40E_VF_DISABLE PF state.

    i40e: Fix ethtool rx-flow-hash setting for X722
    
    [ Upstream commit 54b5af5a438076082d482cab105b1bd484ab5074 ]
    
    When enabling flow type for RSS hash via ethtool:
    
    ethtool -N $pf rx-flow-hash tcp4|tcp6|udp4|udp6 s|d
    
    the driver would fail to setup this setting on X722
    device since it was using the mask on the register
    dedicated for X710 devices.
    
    Apply a different mask on the register when setting the
    RSS hash for the X722 device.
    
    When displaying the flow types enabled via ethtool:
    
    ethtool -n $pf rx-flow-hash tcp4|tcp6|udp4|udp6
    
    the driver would print wrong values for X722 device.
    
    Fix this issue by testing masks for X722 device in
    i40e_get_rss_hash_opts function.

    ipv6: ensure sane device mtu in tunnels
    
    [ Upstream commit d89d7ff01235f218dad37de84457717f699dee79 ]
    
    Another syzbot report [1] with no reproducer hints
    at a bug in ip6_gre tunnel (dev:ip6gretap0)
    
    Since ipv6 mcast code makes sure to read dev->mtu once
    and applies a sanity check on it (see commit b9b312a7a451
    "ipv6: mcast: better catch silly mtu values"), a remaining
    possibility is that a layer is able to set dev->mtu to
    an underflowed value (high order bit set).
    
    This could happen indeed in ip6gre_tnl_link_config_route(),
    ip6_tnl_link_config() and ipip6_tunnel_bind_dev()
    
    Make sure to sanitize mtu value in a local variable before
    it is written once on dev->mtu, as lockless readers could
    catch wrong temporary value.

    tcp: fix indefinite deferral of RTO with SACK reneging
    
    [ Upstream commit 3d2af9cce3133b3bc596a9d065c6f9d93419ccfb ]
    
    This commit fixes a bug that can cause a TCP data sender to repeatedly
    defer RTOs when encountering SACK reneging.
    
    The bug is that when we're in fast recovery in a scenario with SACK
    reneging, every time we get an ACK we call tcp_check_sack_reneging()
    and it can note the apparent SACK reneging and rearm the RTO timer for
    srtt/2 into the future. In some SACK reneging scenarios that can
    happen repeatedly until the receive window fills up, at which point
    the sender can't send any more, the ACKs stop arriving, and the RTO
    fires at srtt/2 after the last ACK. But that can take far too long
    (O(10 secs)), since the connection is stuck in fast recovery with a
    low cwnd that cannot grow beyond ssthresh, even if more bandwidth is
    available.
    
    This fix changes the logic in tcp_check_sack_reneging() to only rearm
    the RTO timer if data is cumulatively ACKed, indicating forward
    progress. This avoids this kind of nearly infinite loop of RTO timer
    re-arming. In addition, this meets the goals of
    tcp_check_sack_reneging() in handling Windows TCP behavior that looks
    temporarily like SACK reneging but is not really.
    
    Many thanks to Jakub Kicinski and Neil Spring, who reported this issue
    and provided critical packet traces that enabled root-causing this
    issue. Also, many thanks to Jakub Kicinski for testing this fix.

    net: fix UAF issue in nfqnl_nf_hook_drop() when ops_init() failed
    
    [ Upstream commit d266935ac43d57586e311a087510fe6a084af742 ]
    
    When the ops_init() interface is invoked to initialize the net, but
    ops->init() fails, data is released. However, the ptr pointer in
    net->gen is invalid. In this case, when nfqnl_nf_hook_drop() is invoked
    to release the net, invalid address access occurs.
    
    The process is as follows:
    setup_net()
            ops_init()
                    data = kzalloc(...)   ---> alloc "data"
                    net_assign_generic()  ---> assign "date" to ptr in net->gen
                    ...
                    ops->init()           ---> failed
                    ...
                    kfree(data);          ---> ptr in net->gen is invalid

    atlantic: fix deadlock at aq_nic_stop
    
    [ Upstream commit 6960d133f66ecddcd3af2b1cbd0c7dcd104268b8 ]
    
    NIC is stopped with rtnl_lock held, and during the stop it cancels the
    'service_task' work and free irqs.
    
    However, if CONFIG_MACSEC is set, rtnl_lock is acquired both from
    aq_nic_service_task and aq_linkstate_threaded_isr. Then a deadlock
    happens if aq_nic_stop tries to cancel/disable them when they've already
    started their execution.
    
    As the deadlock is caused by rtnl_lock, it causes many other processes
    to stall, not only atlantic related stuff.
    
    Fix it by introducing a mutex that protects each NIC's macsec related
    data, and locking it instead of the rtnl_lock from the service task and
    the threaded IRQ.
    
    Before this patch, all macsec data was protected with rtnl_lock, but
    maybe not all of it needs to be protected. With this new mutex, further
    efforts can be made to limit the protected data only to that which
    requires it. However, probably it doesn't worth it because all macsec's
    data accesses are infrequent, and almost all are done from macsec_ops
    or ethtool callbacks, called holding rtnl_lock, so macsec_mutex won't
    never be much contended.
    
    The issue appeared repeteadly attaching and deattaching the NIC to a
    bond interface. Doing that after this patch I cannot reproduce the bug.

    amd-xgbe: add the bit rate quirk for Molex cables
    
    [ Upstream commit 170a9e341a3b02c0b2ea0df16ef14a33a4f41de8 ]
    
    The offset 12 (bit-rate) of EEPROM SFP DAC (passive) cables is expected
    to be in the range 0x64 to 0x68. However, the 5 meter and 7 meter Molex
    passive cables have the rate ceiling 0x78 at offset 12.
    
    Add a quirk for Molex passive cables to extend the rate ceiling to 0x78.

    amd-xgbe: fix the SFP compliance codes check for DAC cables
    
    [ Upstream commit 09c5f6bf11ac98874339e55f4f5f79a9dbc9b375 ]
    
    The current XGBE code assumes that offset 6 of EEPROM SFP DAC (passive)
    cables is NULL. However, some cables (the 5 meter and 7 meter Molex
    passive cables) have non-zero data at offset 6. Fix the logic by moving
    the passive cable check above the active checks, so as not to be
    improperly identified as an active cable. This will fix the issue for
    any passive cable that advertises 1000Base-CX in offset 6.

    When a console stack dump is initiated with CONFIG_GCOV_PROFILE_ALL
    enabled, show_trace_log_lvl() gets out of sync with the ORC unwinder,

    This happens when the compiled code for show_stack() has a single word
    on the stack, and doesn't use a tail call to show_stack_log_lvl().
    (CONFIG_GCOV_PROFILE_ALL=y is the only known case of this.)  Then the
    __unwind_start() skip logic hits an off-by-one bug and fails to unwind
    all the way to the intended starting frame.
    
    Fix it by reverting the following commit:
    
      f1d9a2abff66 ("x86/unwind/orc: Don't skip the first frame for inactive tasks")
    
    The original justification for that commit no longer exists.  That
    original issue was later fixed in a different way, with the following

    When the input parameter idx meets the expected case option in
    hinic_dbg_get_func_table(), read_data is not released. Fix it.

    tipc: fix a null-ptr-deref in tipc_topsrv_accept

    It was caused by srv->listener that might be set to null by
    tipc_topsrv_stop() in net .exit whereas it's still used in
    tipc_topsrv_accept() worker.
    
    srv->listener is protected by srv->idr_lock in tipc_topsrv_stop(), so add
    a check for srv->listener under srv->idr_lock in tipc_topsrv_accept() to
    avoid the null-ptr-deref. To ensure the lsock is not released during the
    tipc_topsrv_accept(), move sock_release() after tipc_topsrv_work_stop()
    where it's waiting until the tipc_topsrv_accept worker to be done.
    
    Note that sk_callback_lock is used to protect sk->sk_user_data instead of
    srv->listener, and it should check srv in tipc_topsrv_listener_data_ready()
    instead. This also ensures that no more tipc_topsrv_accept worker will be
    started after tipc_conn_close() is called in tipc_topsrv_stop() where it
    sets sk->sk_user_data to null.

    clear_cpu_cap(&boot_cpu_data) is very similar to setup_clear_cpu_cap()
    except that the latter also sets a bit in 'cpu_caps_cleared' which
    later clears the same cap in secondary cpus, which is likely what is
    meant here.

    drm/msm: Fix return type of mdp4_lvds_connector_mode_valid
    
    [ Upstream commit 0b33a33bd15d5bab73b87152b220a8d0153a4587 ]
    
    The mode_valid field in drm_connector_helper_funcs is expected to be of
    type:
    enum drm_mode_status (* mode_valid) (struct drm_connector *connector,
                                         struct drm_display_mode *mode);
    
    The mismatched return type breaks forward edge kCFI since the underlying
    function definition does not match the function hook definition.
    
    The return type of mdp4_lvds_connector_mode_valid should be changed from
    int to enum drm_mode_status.

    mm,hugetlb: take hugetlb_lock before decrementing h->resv_huge_pages
    
    commit 12df140f0bdfae5dcfc81800970dd7f6f632e00c upstream.
    
    The h->*_huge_pages counters are protected by the hugetlb_lock, but
    alloc_huge_page has a corner case where it can decrement the counter
    outside of the lock.
    
    This could lead to a corrupted value of h->resv_huge_pages, which we have
    observed on our systems.
    
    Take the hugetlb_lock before decrementing h->resv_huge_pages to avoid a
    potential race.

    xen/gntdev: Prevent leaking grants
    
    commit 0991028cd49567d7016d1b224fe0117c35059f86 upstream.
    
    Prior to this commit, if a grant mapping operation failed partially,
    some of the entries in the map_ops array would be invalid, whereas all
    of the entries in the kmap_ops array would be valid. This in turn would
    cause the following logic in gntdev_map_grant_pages to become invalid:
    
      for (i = 0; i < map->count; i++) {
        if (map->map_ops[i].status == GNTST_okay) {
          map->unmap_ops[i].handle = map->map_ops[i].handle;
          if (!use_ptemod)
            alloced++;
        }
        if (use_ptemod) {
          if (map->kmap_ops[i].status == GNTST_okay) {
            if (map->map_ops[i].status == GNTST_okay)
              alloced++;
            map->kunmap_ops[i].handle = map->kmap_ops[i].handle;
          }
        }
      }
      ...
      atomic_add(alloced, &map->live_grants);
    
    Assume that use_ptemod is true (i.e., the domain mapping the granted
    pages is a paravirtualized domain). In the code excerpt above, note that
    the "alloced" variable is only incremented when both kmap_ops[i].status
    and map_ops[i].status are set to GNTST_okay (i.e., both mapping
    operations are successful).  However, as also noted above, there are
    cases where a grant mapping operation fails partially, breaking the
    assumption of the code excerpt above.
    
    The aforementioned causes map->live_grants to be incorrectly set. In
    some cases, all of the map_ops mappings fail, but all of the kmap_ops
    mappings succeed, meaning that live_grants may remain zero. This in turn
    makes it impossible to unmap the successfully grant-mapped pages pointed
    to by kmap_ops, because unmap_grant_pages has the following snippet of
    code at its beginning:
    
      if (atomic_read(&map->live_grants) == 0)
        return; /* Nothing to do */
    
    In other cases where only some of the map_ops mappings fail but all
    kmap_ops mappings succeed, live_grants is made positive, but when the
    user requests unmapping the grant-mapped pages, __unmap_grant_pages_done
    will then make map->live_grants negative, because the latter function
    does not check if all of the pages that were requested to be unmapped
    were actually unmapped, and the same function unconditionally subtracts
    "data->count" (i.e., a value that can be greater than map->live_grants)
    from map->live_grants. The side effects of a negative live_grants value
    have not been studied.
    
    The net effect of all of this is that grant references are leaked in one
    of the above conditions. In Qubes OS v4.1 (which uses Xen's grant
    mechanism extensively for X11 GUI isolation), this issue manifests
    itself with warning messages like the following to be printed out by the
    Linux kernel in the VM that had granted pages (that contain X11 GUI
    window data) to dom0: "g.e. 0x1234 still pending", especially after the
    user rapidly resizes GUI VM windows (causing some grant-mapping
    operations to partially or completely fail, due to the fact that the VM
    unshares some of the pages as part of the window resizing, making the
    pages impossible to grant-map from dom0).
    
    The fix for this issue involves counting all successful map_ops and
    kmap_ops mappings separately, and then adding the sum to live_grants.
    During unmapping, only the number of successfully unmapped grants is
    subtracted from live_grants. The code is also modified to check for
    negative live_grants values after the subtraction and warn the user.

    Xen/gntdev: don't ignore kernel unmapping error
    
    commit f28347cc66395e96712f5c2db0a302ee75bafce6 upstream.
    
    While working on XSA-361 and its follow-ups, I failed to spot another
    place where the kernel mapping part of an operation was not treated the
    same as the user space part. Detect and propagate errors and add a 2nd
    pr_debug().

    kernfs: fix use-after-free in __kernfs_remove
    
    commit 4abc99652812a2ddf932f137515d5c5a04723538 upstream.
    
    Syzkaller managed to trigger concurrent calls to
    kernfs_remove_by_name_ns() for the same file resulting in
    a KASAN detected use-after-free. The race occurs when the root
    node is freed during kernfs_drain().
    
    To prevent this acquire an additional reference for the root
    of the tree that is removed before calling __kernfs_remove().
    
    Found by syzkaller with the following reproducer (slab_nomerge is
    required):
    
    syz_mount_image$ext4(0x0, &(0x7f0000000100)='./file0\x00', 0x100000, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)
    r0 = openat(0xffffffffffffff9c, &(0x7f0000000080)='/proc/self/exe\x00', 0x0, 0x0)
    close(r0)
    pipe2(&(0x7f0000000140)={0xffffffffffffffff, <r1=>0xffffffffffffffff}, 0x800)
    mount$9p_fd(0x0, &(0x7f0000000040)='./file0\x00', &(0x7f00000000c0), 0x408, &(0x7f0000000280)={'trans=fd,', {'rfdno', 0x3d, r0}, 0x2c, {'wfdno', 0x3d, r1}, 0x2c, {[{@cache_loose}, {@mmap}, {@loose}, {@loose}, {@mmap}], [{@mask={'mask', 0x3d, '^MAY_EXEC'}}, {@fsmagic={'fsmagic', 0x3d, 0x10001}}, {@dont_hash}]}})

    counter: microchip-tcb-capture: Handle Signal1 read and Synapse
    
    commit d917a62af81b133f35f627e7936e193c842a7947 upstream.
    
    The signal_read(), action_read(), and action_write() callbacks have been
    assuming Signal0 is requested without checking. This results in requests
    for Signal1 returning data for Signal0. This patch fixes these
    oversights by properly checking for the Signal's id in the respective
    callbacks and handling accordingly based on the particular Signal
    requested. The trig_inverted member of the mchp_tc_data is removed as
    superfluous.

    mmc: core: Fix kernel panic when remove non-standard SDIO card
    
    commit 9972e6b404884adae9eec7463e30d9b3c9a70b18 upstream.
    
    SDIO tuple is only allocated for standard SDIO card, especially it causes
    memory corruption issues when the non-standard SDIO card has removed, which
    is because the card device's reference counter does not increase for it at
    sdio_init_func(), but all SDIO card device reference counter gets decreased
    at sdio_release_func().

    drm/msm/dp: fix IRQ lifetime
    
    commit a79343dcaba4b11adb57350e0b6426906a9b658e upstream.
    
    Device-managed resources allocated post component bind must be tied to
    the lifetime of the aggregate DRM device or they will not necessarily be
    released when binding of the aggregate device is deferred.
    
    This is specifically true for the DP IRQ, which will otherwise remain
    requested so that the next bind attempt fails when requesting the IRQ a
    second time.
    
    Since commit c3bf8e21b38a ("drm/msm/dp: Add eDP support via aux_bus")
    this can happen when the aux-bus panel driver has not yet been loaded so
    that probe is deferred.
    
    Fix this by tying the device-managed lifetime of the DP IRQ to the DRM
    device so that it is released when bind fails.

    mac802154: Fix LQI recording
    
    commit 5a5c4e06fd03b595542d5590f2bc05a6b7fc5c2b upstream.
    
    Back in 2014, the LQI was saved in the skb control buffer (skb->cb, or
    mac_cb(skb)) without any actual reset of this area prior to its use.
    
    As part of a useful rework of the use of this region, 32edc40ae65c
    ("ieee802154: change _cb handling slightly") introduced mac_cb_init() to
    basically memset the cb field to 0. In particular, this new function got
    called at the beginning of mac802154_parse_frame_start(), right before
    the location where the buffer got actually filled.
    
    What went through unnoticed however, is the fact that the very first
    helper called by device drivers in the receive path already used this
    area to save the LQI value for later extraction. Resetting the cb field
    "so late" led to systematically zeroing the LQI.
    
    If we consider the reset of the cb field needed, we can make it as soon
    as we get an skb from a device driver, right before storing the LQI,
    as is the very first time we need to write something there.

    The iio_utils uses a digit calculation in order to know length of the

    This leads to allocation of one character too small buffer for the

    '0'.

    xhci: Remove device endpoints from bandwidth list when freeing the device
    
    commit 5aed5b7c2430ce318a8e62f752f181e66f0d1053 upstream.
    
    Endpoints are normally deleted from the bandwidth list when they are
    dropped, before the virt device is freed.
    
    If xHC host is dying or being removed then the endpoints aren't dropped
    cleanly due to functions returning early to avoid interacting with a
    non-accessible host controller.
    
    So check and delete endpoints that are still on the bandwidth list when
    freeing the virt device.
    
    Solves a list_del corruption kernel crash when unbinding xhci-pci,
    caused by xhci_mem_cleanup() when it later tried to delete already freed
    endpoints from the bandwidth list.
    
    This only affects hosts that use software bandwidth checking, which
    currenty is only the xHC in intel Panther Point PCH (Ivy Bridge)

    xhci: Add quirk to reset host back to default state at shutdown
    
    commit 34cd2db408d591bc15771cbcc90939ade0a99a21 upstream.
    
    Systems based on Alder Lake P see significant boot time delay if
    boot firmware tries to control usb ports in unexpected link states.
    
    This is seen with self-powered usb devices that survive in U3 link
    suspended state over S5.
    
    A more generic solution to power off ports at shutdown was attempted in
    commit 83810f84ecf1 ("xhci: turn off port power in shutdown")
    but it caused regression.
    
    Add host specific XHCI_RESET_TO_DEFAULT quirk which will reset host and
    ports back to default state in shutdown.

    mtd: rawnand: marvell: Use correct logic for nand-keep-config
    
    commit ce107713b722af57c4b7f2477594d445b496420e upstream.
    
    Originally the absence of the marvell,nand-keep-config property caused
    the setup_data_interface function to be provided. However when
    setup_data_interface was moved into nand_controller_ops the logic was
    unintentionally inverted. Update the logic so that only if the
    marvell,nand-keep-config property is present the bootloader NAND config
    kept.

    controller driver respect that. That is, don't set IMI (Interrupt on
    Missed Isoc) when usb_request->no_interrupt is set. Also, the driver
    should only set IMI to the last TRB of a chain.

    commit f78961f8380b940e0cfc7e549336c21a2ad44f4d upstream.
    
    When servicing a transfer completion event, the dwc3 driver will reclaim
    TRBs of started requests up to the request associated with the interrupt
    event. Currently we don't check for interrupt due to missed isoc, and
    the driver may attempt to reclaim TRBs beyond the associated event. This
    causes invalid memory access when the hardware still owns the TRB. If
    there's a missed isoc TRB with IMI (interrupt on missed isoc), make sure
    to stop servicing further.
    
    Note that only the last TRB of chained TRBs has its status updated with
    missed isoc.

    USB: add RESET_RESUME quirk for NVIDIA Jetson devices in RCM
    
    commit fc4ade55c617dc73c7e9756b57f3230b4ff24540 upstream.
    
    NVIDIA Jetson devices in Force Recovery mode (RCM) do not support
    suspending, ie. flashing fails if the device has been suspended. The
    devices are still visible in lsusb and seem to work otherwise, making
    the issue hard to debug. This has been discovered in various forum
    posts, eg. [1].
    
    The patch has been tested on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, but I'm adding
    all the Jetson models listed in [2] on the assumption that they all
    behave similarly.

    ALSA: Use del_timer_sync() before freeing timer
    
    commit f0a868788fcbf63cdab51f5adcf73b271ede8164 upstream.
    
    The current code for freeing the emux timer is extremely dangerous:
    
      CPU0                          CPU1
      ----                          ----
    snd_emux_timer_callback()
                                snd_emux_free()
                                  spin_lock(&emu->voice_lock)
                                  del_timer(&emu->tlist); <-- returns immediately
                                  spin_unlock(&emu->voice_lock);
                                  [..]
                                  kfree(emu);
    
      spin_lock(&emu->voice_lock);
    
     [BOOM!]
    
    Instead just use del_timer_sync() which will wait for the timer to finish
    before continuing. No need to check if the timer is active or not when
    doing so.
    
    This doesn't fix the race of a possible re-arming of the timer, but at
    least it won't use the data that has just been freed.

    can: kvaser_usb: Fix possible completions during init_completion
    
    commit 2871edb32f4622c3a25ce4b3977bad9050b91974 upstream.
    
    kvaser_usb uses completions to signal when a response event is received
    for outgoing commands.
    
    However, it uses init_completion() to reinitialize the start_comp and
    stop_comp completions before sending the start/stop commands.
    
    In case the device sends the corresponding response just before the
    actual command is sent, complete() may be called concurrently with
    init_completion() which is not safe.
    
    This might be triggerable even with a properly functioning device by
    stopping the interface (CMD_STOP_CHIP) just after it goes bus-off (which
    also causes the driver to send CMD_STOP_CHIP when restart-ms is off),
    but that was not tested.
    
    Fix the issue by using reinit_completion() instead.
