    Revert "Revert "md/raid5: Wait for MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING in raid5d""
    
    This reverts commit bed9e27baf52a09b7ba2a3714f1e24e17ced386d.
    
    The original set [1][2] was expected to undo a suboptimal fix in [2], and
    replace it with a better fix [1]. However, as reported by Dan Moulding [2]
    causes an issue with raid5 with journal device.
    
    Revert [2] for now to close the issue. We will follow up on another issue
    reported by Juxiao Bi, as [2] is expected to fix it. We believe this is a
    good trade-off, because the latter issue happens less freqently.
    
    In the meanwhile, we will NOT revert [1], as it contains the right logic.

    block: Remove special-casing of compound pages
    
    commit 1b151e2435fc3a9b10c8946c6aebe9f3e1938c55 upstream.
    
    The special casing was originally added in pre-git history; reproducing

    >     [PATCH] Speed up direct-io hugetlbpage handling
    >
    >     This patch short-circuits all the direct-io page dirtying logic for
    >     higher-order pages.  Without this, we pointlessly bounce BIOs up to
    >     keventd all the time.
    
    In the last twenty years, compound pages have become used for more than
    just hugetlb.  Rewrite these functions to operate on folios instead
    of pages and remove the special case for hugetlbfs; I don't think
    it's needed any more (and if it is, we can put it back in as a call
    to folio_test_hugetlb()).
    
    This was found by inspection; as far as I can tell, this bug can lead
    to pages used as the destination of a direct I/O read not being marked
    as dirty.  If those pages are then reclaimed by the MM without being
    dirtied for some other reason, they won't be written out.  Then when
    they're faulted back in, they will not contain the data they should.
    It'll take a pretty unusual setup to produce this problem with several
    races all going the wrong way.
    
    This problem predates the folio work; it could for example have been
    triggered by mmaping a THP in tmpfs and using that as the target of an
    O_DIRECT read.

    i2c: s3c24xx: fix transferring more than one message in polling mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 990489e1042c6c5d6bccf56deca68f8dbeed8180 ]
    
    To properly handle ACK on the bus when transferring more than one
    message in polling mode, move the polling handling loop from
    s3c24xx_i2c_message_start() to s3c24xx_i2c_doxfer(). This way
    i2c_s3c_irq_nextbyte() is always executed till the end, properly
    acknowledging the IRQ bits and no recursive calls to
    i2c_s3c_irq_nextbyte() are made.
    
    While touching this, also fix finishing transfers in polling mode by
    using common code path and always waiting for the bus to become idle
    and disabled.

    selftests: mlxsw: qos_pfc: Adjust the test to support 8 lanes
    
    [ Upstream commit b34f4de6d30cbaa8fed905a5080b6eace8c84dc7 ]
    
    'qos_pfc' test checks PFC behavior. The idea is to limit the traffic
    using a shaper somewhere in the flow of the packets. In this area, the
    buffer is smaller than the buffer at the beginning of the flow, so it fills
    up until there is no more space left. The test configures there PFC
    which is supposed to notice that the headroom is filling up and send PFC
    Xoff to indicate the transmitter to stop sending traffic for the priorities
    sharing this PG.
    
    The Xon/Xoff threshold is auto-configured and always equal to
    2*(MTU rounded up to cell size). Even after sending the PFC Xoff packet,
    traffic will keep arriving until the transmitter receives and processes
    the PFC packet. This amount of traffic is known as the PFC delay allowance.
    
    Currently the buffer for the delay traffic is configured as 100KB. The
    MTU in the test is 10KB, therefore the threshold for Xoff is about 20KB.
    This allows 80KB extra to be stored in this buffer.
    
    8-lane ports use two buffers among which the configured buffer is split,
    the Xoff threshold then applies to each buffer in parallel.
    
    The test does not take into account the behavior of 8-lane ports, when the
    ports are configured to 400Gbps with 8 lanes or 800Gbps with 8 lanes,
    packets are dropped and the test fails.
    
    Check if the relevant ports use 8 lanes, in such case double the size of
    the buffer, as the headroom is split half-half.

    mlxsw: spectrum_acl_erp: Fix error flow of pool allocation failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d6eeabcfaba2fcadf5443b575789ea606f9de83 ]
    
    Lately, a bug was found when many TC filters are added - at some point,
    several bugs are printed to dmesg [1] and the switch is crashed with
    segmentation fault.
    
    The issue starts when gen_pool_free() fails because of unexpected
    behavior - a try to free memory which is already freed, this leads to BUG()
    call which crashes the switch and makes many other bugs.
    
    Trying to track down the unexpected behavior led to a bug in eRP code. The
    function mlxsw_sp_acl_erp_table_alloc() gets a pointer to the allocated
    index, sets the value and returns an error code. When gen_pool_alloc()
    fails it returns address 0, we track it and return -ENOBUFS outside, BUT
    the call for gen_pool_alloc() already override the index in erp_table
    structure. This is a problem when such allocation is done as part of
    table expansion. This is not a new table, which will not be used in case
    of allocation failure. We try to expand eRP table and override the
    current index (non-zero) with zero. Then, it leads to an unexpected
    behavior when address 0 is freed twice. Note that address 0 is valid in
    erp_table->base_index and indeed other tables use it.
    
    gen_pool_alloc() fails in case that there is no space left in the
    pre-allocated pool, in our case, the pool is limited to
    ACL_MAX_ERPT_BANK_SIZE, which is read from hardware. When more than max
    erp entries are required, we exceed the limit and return an error, this
    error leads to "Failed to migrate vregion" print.
    
    Fix this by changing erp_table->base_index only in case of a successful
    allocation.
    
    Add a test case for such a scenario. Without this fix it causes
    segmentation fault:
    
    $ TESTS="max_erp_entries_test" ./tc_flower.sh
    ./tc_flower.sh: line 988:  1560 Segmentation fault      tc filter del dev $h2 ingress chain $i protocol ip pref $i handle $j flower &>/dev/null

    loop: fix the the direct I/O support check when used on top of block devices
    
    [ Upstream commit baa7d536077dcdfe2b70c476a8873d1745d3de0f ]
    
    __loop_update_dio only checks the alignment requirement for block backed
    file systems, but misses them for the case where the loop device is
    created directly on top of another block device.  Due to this creating
    a loop device with default option plus the direct I/O flag on a > 512 byte
    sector size file system will lead to incorrect I/O being submitted to the
    lower block device and a lot of error from the lock layer.  This can
    be seen with xfstests generic/563.
    
    Fix the code in __loop_update_dio by factoring the alignment check into
    a helper, and calling that also for the struct block_device of a block
    device inode.
    
    Also remove the TODO comment talking about dynamically switching between
    buffered and direct I/O, which is a would be a recipe for horrible
    performance and occasional data loss.

    kdb: Fix a potential buffer overflow in kdb_local()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f41d30cd6dc865c3cbc1a852372321eba6d4e4c ]
    
    When appending "[defcmd]" to 'kdb_prompt_str', the size of the string
    already in the buffer should be taken into account.
    
    An option could be to switch from strncat() to strlcat() which does the
    correct test to avoid such an overflow.
    
    However, this actually looks as dead code, because 'defcmd_in_progress'
    can't be true here.
    See a more detailed explanation at [1].

    Delete from packet path relies on the garbage collector to purge

    netfilter: bridge: replace physindev with physinif in nf_bridge_info
    
    [ Upstream commit 9874808878d9eed407e3977fd11fee49de1e1d86 ]
    
    An skb can be added to a neigh->arp_queue while waiting for an arp
    reply. Where original skb's skb->dev can be different to neigh's
    neigh->dev. For instance in case of bridging dnated skb from one veth to
    another, the skb would be added to a neigh->arp_queue of the bridge.
    
    As skb->dev can be reset back to nf_bridge->physindev and used, and as
    there is no explicit mechanism that prevents this physindev from been
    freed under us (for instance neigh_flush_dev doesn't cleanup skbs from
    different device's neigh queue) we can crash on e.g. this stack:
    
    arp_process
      neigh_update
        skb = __skb_dequeue(&neigh->arp_queue)
          neigh_resolve_output(..., skb)
            ...
              br_nf_dev_xmit
                br_nf_pre_routing_finish_bridge_slow
                  skb->dev = nf_bridge->physindev
                  br_handle_frame_finish
    
    Let's use plain ifindex instead of net_device link. To peek into the
    original net_device we will use dev_get_by_index_rcu(). Thus either we
    get device and are safe to use it or we don't get it and drop skb.

    On my machine, which has CONFIG_PAGE_SIZE_16KB=y, the test failed at
    loading a BPF prog with 2039 instructions:
    
      prog = (struct bpf_prog *)ffff80001b894000
      insn = (struct bpf_insn *)(prog->insnsi)ffff80001b894048
      insn + 2039 = (struct bpf_insn *)ffff80001b898000 <- end of the page
    
    In the build_insn() function, we are trying to access next instruction
    unconditionally, i.e. `(insn + 1)->imm`. The address lies in the next
    page and can be not owned by the current process, thus an page fault is
    inevitable and then segfault.
    
    So, let's access next instruction only under `dst = imm64` context.
    
    With this fix, we have:

    bpf: Reject variable offset alu on PTR_TO_FLOW_KEYS
    
    [ Upstream commit 22c7fa171a02d310e3a3f6ed46a698ca8a0060ed ]
    
    For PTR_TO_FLOW_KEYS, check_flow_keys_access() only uses fixed off
    for validation. However, variable offset ptr alu is not prohibited
    for this ptr kind. So the variable offset is not checked.
    
    The following prog is accepted:
    
      func#0 @0
      0: R1=ctx() R10=fp0
      0: (bf) r6 = r1                       ; R1=ctx() R6_w=ctx()
      1: (79) r7 = *(u64 *)(r6 +144)        ; R6_w=ctx() R7_w=flow_keys()
      2: (b7) r8 = 1024                     ; R8_w=1024
      3: (37) r8 /= 1                       ; R8_w=scalar()
      4: (57) r8 &= 1024                    ; R8_w=scalar(smin=smin32=0,
      smax=umax=smax32=umax32=1024,var_off=(0x0; 0x400))
      5: (0f) r7 += r8
      mark_precise: frame0: last_idx 5 first_idx 0 subseq_idx -1
      mark_precise: frame0: regs=r8 stack= before 4: (57) r8 &= 1024
      mark_precise: frame0: regs=r8 stack= before 3: (37) r8 /= 1
      mark_precise: frame0: regs=r8 stack= before 2: (b7) r8 = 1024
      6: R7_w=flow_keys(smin=smin32=0,smax=umax=smax32=umax32=1024,var_off
      =(0x0; 0x400)) R8_w=scalar(smin=smin32=0,smax=umax=smax32=umax32=1024,
      var_off=(0x0; 0x400))
      6: (79) r0 = *(u64 *)(r7 +0)          ; R0_w=scalar()
      7: (95) exit
    
    This prog loads flow_keys to r7, and adds the variable offset r8
    to r7, and finally causes out-of-bounds access:

    Multiple disable_irq_wake() calls will keep decreasing the IRQ
    wake_depth, When wake_depth is 0, calling disable_irq_wake() again,
    will report the above calltrace.
    
    Due to the need to appear in pairs, we cannot call disable_irq_wake()
    without calling enable_irq_wake(). Fix this by making sure there are
    no unbalanced disable_irq_wake() calls.

    net: ravb: Fix dma_addr_t truncation in error case
    
    [ Upstream commit e327b2372bc0f18c30433ac40be07741b59231c5 ]
    
    In ravb_start_xmit(), ravb driver uses u32 variable to store result of
    dma_map_single() call. Since ravb hardware has 32-bit address fields in
    descriptors, this works properly when mapping is successful - it is
    platform's job to provide mapping addresses that fit into hardware
    limitations.
    
    However, in failure case dma_map_single() returns DMA_MAPPING_ERROR
    constant that is 64-bit when dma_addr_t is 64-bit. Storing this constant
    in u32 leads to truncation, and further call to dma_mapping_error()
    fails to notice the error.
    
    Fix that by storing result of dma_map_single() in a dma_addr_t
    variable.

    block: ensure we hold a queue reference when using queue limits
    
    [ Upstream commit 7b4f36cd22a65b750b4cb6ac14804fb7d6e6c67d ]
    
    q_usage_counter is the only thing preventing us from the limits changing
    under us in __bio_split_to_limits, but blk_mq_submit_bio doesn't hold
    it while calling into it.
    
    Move the splitting inside the region where we know we've got a queue
    reference. Ideally this could still remain a shared section of code, but
    let's keep the fix simple and defer any refactoring here to later.

    mptcp: refine opt_mp_capable determination
    
    [ Upstream commit 724b00c12957973656d312dce2a110c75ae2c680 ]
    
    OPTIONS_MPTCP_MPC is a combination of three flags.
    
    It would be better to be strict about testing what
    flag is expected, at least for code readability.
    
    mptcp_parse_option() already makes the distinction.
    
    - subflow_check_req() should use OPTION_MPTCP_MPC_SYN.
    
    - mptcp_subflow_init_cookie_req() should use OPTION_MPTCP_MPC_ACK.
    
    - subflow_finish_connect() should use OPTION_MPTCP_MPC_SYNACK
    
    - subflow_syn_recv_sock should use OPTION_MPTCP_MPC_ACK

    [ Upstream commit 89e23277f9c16df6f9f9c1a1a07f8f132339c15c ]
    
    mptcp_parse_option() currently sets OPTIONS_MPTCP_MPJ, for the three
    possible cases handled for MPTCPOPT_MP_JOIN option.
    
    OPTIONS_MPTCP_MPJ is the combination of three flags:
    - OPTION_MPTCP_MPJ_SYN
    - OPTION_MPTCP_MPJ_SYNACK
    - OPTION_MPTCP_MPJ_ACK
    
    This is a problem, because backup, join_id, token, nonce and/or hmac fields
    could be left uninitialized in some cases.
    
    Distinguish the three cases, as following patches will need this step.

    net: phy: micrel: populate .soft_reset for KSZ9131
    
    [ Upstream commit e398822c4751017fe401f57409488f5948d12fb5 ]
    
    The RZ/G3S SMARC Module has 2 KSZ9131 PHYs. In this setup, the KSZ9131 PHY
    is used with the ravb Ethernet driver. It has been discovered that when
    bringing the Ethernet interface down/up continuously, e.g., with the
    following sh script:
    
    $ while :; do ifconfig eth0 down; ifconfig eth0 up; done
    
    the link speed and duplex are wrong after interrupting the bring down/up
    operation even though the Ethernet interface is up. To recover from this
    state the following configuration sequence is necessary (executed
    manually):
    
    $ ifconfig eth0 down
    $ ifconfig eth0 up
    
    The behavior has been identified also on the Microchip SAMA7G5-EK board
    which runs the macb driver and uses the same PHY.
    
    The order of PHY-related operations in ravb_open() is as follows:
    ravb_open() ->
      ravb_phy_start() ->
        ravb_phy_init() ->
          of_phy_connect() ->
            phy_connect_direct() ->
              phy_attach_direct() ->
                phy_init_hw() ->
                  phydev->drv->soft_reset()
                  phydev->drv->config_init()
                  phydev->drv->config_intr()
                phy_resume()
                  kszphy_resume()
    
    The order of PHY-related operations in ravb_close is as follows:
    ravb_close() ->
      phy_stop() ->
        phy_suspend() ->
          kszphy_suspend() ->
            genphy_suspend()
              // set BMCR_PDOWN bit in MII_BMCR
    
    In genphy_suspend() setting the BMCR_PDWN bit in MII_BMCR switches the PHY
    to Software Power-Down (SPD) mode (according to the KSZ9131 datasheet).
    Thus, when opening the interface after it has been  previously closed (via
    ravb_close()), the phydev->drv->config_init() and
    phydev->drv->config_intr() reach the KSZ9131 PHY driver via the
    ksz9131_config_init() and kszphy_config_intr() functions.
    
    KSZ9131 specifies that the MII management interface remains operational
    during SPD (Software Power-Down), but (according to manual):
    - Only access to the standard registers (0 through 31) is supported.
    - Access to MMD address spaces other than MMD address space 1 is possible
      if the spd_clock_gate_override bit is set.
    - Access to MMD address space 1 is not possible.
    
    The spd_clock_gate_override bit is not used in the KSZ9131 driver.
    
    ksz9131_config_init() configures RGMII delay, pad skews and LEDs by
    accessesing MMD registers other than those in address space 1.
    
    The datasheet for the KSZ9131 does not specify what happens if registers
    from an unsupported address space are accessed while the PHY is in SPD.
    
    To fix the issue the .soft_reset method has been instantiated for KSZ9131,
    too. This resets the PHY to the default state before doing any
    configurations to it, thus switching it out of SPD.

    amt: do not use overwrapped cb area
    
    [ Upstream commit bec161add35b478a7746bf58bcdea6faa19129ef ]
    
    amt driver uses skb->cb for storing tunnel information.
    This job is worked before TC layer and then amt driver load tunnel info
    from skb->cb after TC layer.
    So, its cb area should not be overwrapped with CB area used by TC.
    In order to not use cb area used by TC, it skips the biggest cb
    structure used by TC, which was qdisc_skb_cb.
    But it's not anymore.
    Currently, biggest structure of TC's CB is tc_skb_cb.
    So, it should skip size of tc_skb_cb instead of qdisc_skb_cb.

    net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: Fix max mtu to fit ethernet frames
    
    [ Upstream commit 64e47d8afb5ca533b27efc006405e5bcae2c4a7b ]
    
    The value of AM65_CPSW_MAX_PACKET_SIZE represents the maximum length
    of a received frame. This value is written to the register
    AM65_CPSW_PORT_REG_RX_MAXLEN.
    
    The maximum MTU configured on the network device should then leave
    some room for the ethernet headers and frame check. Otherwise, if
    the network interface is configured to its maximum mtu possible,
    the frames will be larger than AM65_CPSW_MAX_PACKET_SIZE and will
    get dropped as oversized.
    
    The switch supports ethernet frame sizes between 64 and 2024 bytes
    (including VLAN) as stated in the technical reference manual, so
    define AM65_CPSW_MAX_PACKET_SIZE with that maximum size.

    s390/pci: fix max size calculation in zpci_memcpy_toio()
    
    [ Upstream commit 80df7d6af7f6d229b34cf237b2cc9024c07111cd ]
    
    The zpci_get_max_write_size() helper is used to determine the maximum
    size a PCI store or load can use at a given __iomem address.
    
    For the PCI block store the following restrictions apply:
    
    1. The dst + len must not cross a 4K boundary in the (pseudo-)MMIO space
    2. len must not exceed ZPCI_MAX_WRITE_SIZE
    3. len must be a multiple of 8 bytes
    4. The src address must be double word (8 byte) aligned
    5. The dst address must be double word (8 byte) aligned
    
    Otherwise only a normal PCI store which takes its src value from
    a register can be used. For these PCI store restriction 1 still applies.
    Similarly 1 also applies to PCI loads.
    
    It turns out zpci_max_write_size() instead implements stricter
    conditions which prevents PCI block stores from being used where they
    can and should be used. In particular instead of conditions 4 and 5 it
    wrongly enforces both dst and src to be size aligned. This indirectly
    covers condition 1 but also prevents many legal PCI block stores.
    
    On top of the functional shortcomings the zpci_get_max_write_size() is
    misnamed as it is used for both read and write size calculations. Rename
    it to zpci_get_max_io_size() and implement the listed conditions
    explicitly.

    ASoC: mediatek: sof-common: Add NULL check for normal_link string
    
    [ Upstream commit e3b3ec967a7d93b9010a5af9a2394c8b5c8f31ed ]
    
    It's not granted that all entries of struct sof_conn_stream declare
    a `normal_link` (a non-SOF, direct link) string, and this is the case
    for SoCs that support only SOF paths (hence do not support both direct
    and SOF usecases).
    
    For example, in the case of MT8188 there is no normal_link string in
    any of the sof_conn_stream entries and there will be more drivers
    doing that in the future.
    
    To avoid possible NULL pointer KPs, add a NULL check for `normal_link`.

    PCI: mediatek-gen3: Fix translation window size calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit 9ccc1318cf4bd90601f221268e42c3374703d681 ]
    
    When using the fls() helper, the translation table should be a power of
    two; otherwise, the resulting value will not be correct.
    
    For example, given fls(0x3e00000) - 1 = 25, the PCIe translation window
    size will be set to 0x2000000 instead of the expected size 0x3e00000.
    
    Fix the translation window by splitting the MMIO space into multiple tables
    if its size is not a power of two.

    PCI: keystone: Fix race condition when initializing PHYs
    
    [ Upstream commit c12ca110c613a81cb0f0099019c839d078cd0f38 ]
    
    The PCI driver invokes the PHY APIs using the ks_pcie_enable_phy()
    function. The PHY in this case is the Serdes. It is possible that the
    PCI instance is configured for two lane operation across two different
    Serdes instances, using one lane of each Serdes.
    
    In such a configuration, if the reference clock for one Serdes is
    provided by the other Serdes, it results in a race condition. After the
    Serdes providing the reference clock is initialized by the PCI driver by
    invoking its PHY APIs, it is not guaranteed that this Serdes remains
    powered on long enough for the PHY APIs based initialization of the
    dependent Serdes. In such cases, the PLL of the dependent Serdes fails
    to lock due to the absence of the reference clock from the former Serdes
    which has been powered off by the PM Core.
    
    Fix this by obtaining reference to the PHYs before invoking the PHY
    initialization APIs and releasing reference after the initialization is
    complete.

    nvmet: re-fix tracing strncpy() warning
    
    [ Upstream commit 4ee7ffeb4ce50c80bc4504db6f39b25a2df6bcf4 ]
    
    An earlier patch had tried to address a warning about a string copy with
    missing zero termination:
    
    drivers/nvme/target/trace.h:52:3: warning: ‘strncpy’ specified bound 32 equals destination size [-Wstringop-truncation]
    
    The new version causes a different warning with some compiler versions, notably
    gcc-9 and gcc-10, and also misses the zero padding that was apparently done
    intentionally in the original code:
    
    drivers/nvme/target/trace.h:56:2: error: 'strncpy' specified bound depends on the length of the source argument [-Werror=stringop-overflow=]
    
    Change it to use strscpy_pad() with the original length, which will give
    a properly padded and zero-terminated string as well as avoiding the warning.

    It can be fixed by setting rxfifo depth less than 4k bytes, prefer to use

    apparmor: avoid crash when parsed profile name is empty
    
    [ Upstream commit 55a8210c9e7d21ff2644809699765796d4bfb200 ]
    
    When processing a packed profile in unpack_profile() described like

    a string ":samba-dcerpcd" is unpacked as a fully-qualified name and then
    passed to aa_splitn_fqname().
    
    aa_splitn_fqname() treats ":samba-dcerpcd" as only containing a namespace.
    Thus it returns NULL for tmpname, meanwhile tmpns is non-NULL. Later

    It seems such behaviour of aa_splitn_fqname() is expected and checked in
    other places where it is called (e.g. aa_remove_profiles). Well, there
    is an explicit comment "a ns name without a following profile is allowed"
    inside.
    
    AFAICS, nothing can prevent unpacked "name" to be in form like
    ":samba-dcerpcd" - it is passed from userspace.
    
    Deny the whole profile set replacement in such case and inform user with
    EPROTO and an explaining message.

    [ Upstream commit 0849a5441358cef02586fb2d60f707c0db195628 ]
    
    in nvmet_tcp_handle_h2c_data_pdu(), if the host sends a data_offset
    different from rbytes_done, the driver ends up calling nvmet_req_complete()
    passing a status error.
    The problem is that at this point cmd->req is not yet initialized,
    the kernel will crash after dereferencing a NULL pointer.
    
    Fix the bug by replacing the call to nvmet_req_complete() with
    nvmet_tcp_fatal_error().

    spmi: mtk-pmif: Serialize PMIF status check and command submission
    
    [ Upstream commit f200fff8d019f2754f91f5d715652e3e3fdf3604 ]
    
    Before writing the read or write command to the SPMI arbiter through the
    PMIF interface, the current status of the channel is checked to ensure
    it is idle. However, since the status only changes from idle when the
    command is written, it is possible for two concurrent calls to determine
    that the channel is idle and simultaneously send their commands. At this
    point the PMIF interface hangs, with the status register no longer being
    updated, and thus causing all subsequent operations to time out.
    
    This was observed on the mt8195-cherry-tomato-r2 machine, particularly
    after commit 46600ab142f8 ("regulator: Set PROBE_PREFER_ASYNCHRONOUS for
    drivers between 5.10 and 5.15") was applied, since then the two MT6315
    devices present on the SPMI bus would probe assynchronously and
    sometimes (during probe or at a later point) read the bus
    simultaneously, breaking the PMIF interface and consequently slowing
    down the whole system.
    
    To fix the issue at its root cause, introduce locking around the channel
    status check and the command write, so that both become an atomic
    operation, preventing race conditions between two (or more) SPMI bus
    read/write operations. A spinlock is used since this is a fast bus, as
    indicated by the usage of the atomic variant of readl_poll, and
    '.fast_io = true' being used in the mt6315 driver, so spinlocks are
    already used for the regmap access.

    usb: cdc-acm: return correct error code on unsupported break
    
    [ Upstream commit 66aad7d8d3ec5a3a8ec2023841bcec2ded5f65c9 ]
    
    In ACM support for sending breaks to devices is optional.
    If a device says that it doenot support sending breaks,
    the host must respect that.
    Given the number of optional features providing tty operations
    for each combination is not practical and errors need to be
    returned dynamically if unsupported features are requested.
    
    In case a device does not support break, we want the tty layer
    to treat that like it treats drivers that statically cannot
    support sending a break. It ignores the inability and does nothing.
    This patch uses EOPNOTSUPP to indicate that.

    tty: early return from send_break() on TTY_DRIVER_HARDWARE_BREAK
    
    [ Upstream commit 66619686d187b4a6395316b7f39881e945dce4bc ]
    
    If the driver sets TTY_DRIVER_HARDWARE_BREAK, we leave ops->break_ctl()
    to the driver and return from send_break(). But we do it using a local
    variable and keep the code flowing through the end of the function.
    Instead, do 'return' immediately with the ops->break_ctl()'s return
    value.
    
    This way, we don't have to stuff the 'else' branch of the 'if' with the
    software break handling. And we can re-indent the function too.

    values as given when reading in_voltage_scale. Fix it by computing the
    available scales during probe and properly pass the list when
    .read_available() is called.
    
    While at it, change to use .read_available() from iio_info. Also note
    that to properly fix this, adi-axi-adc.c has to be changed accordingly.

    iio: adc: ad9467: fix reset gpio handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 76f028539cf360f750efd8cde560edda298e4c6b ]
    
    The reset gpio was being handled with inverted polarity. This means that
    as far as gpiolib is concerned we were actually leaving the pin asserted
    (in theory, this would mean reset). However, inverting the polarity in
    devicetree made things work. Fix it by doing it the proper way and how
    gpiolib expects it to be done.
    
    While at it, moved the handling to it's own function and dropped
    'reset_gpio' from the 'struct ad9467_state' as we only need it during
    probe. On top of that, refactored things so that we now request the gpio
    asserted (i.e in reset) and then de-assert it. Also note that we now use
    gpiod_set_value_cansleep() instead of gpiod_direction_output() as we
    already request the pin as output.

    serial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock
    
    [ Upstream commit 78d60dae9a0c9f09aa3d6477c94047df2fe6f7b0 ]
    
    When using the serial port as RS485 port, the tx statemachine is used to
    control the RTS pin to drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin. When the
    TTY port is closed in the middle of a transmission (for instance during
    userland application crash), imx_uart_shutdown disables the interface
    and disables the Transmission Complete interrupt. afer that,
    imx_uart_stop_tx bails on an incomplete transmission, to be retriggered
    by the TC interrupt. This interrupt is disabled and therefore the tx
    statemachine never transitions out of SEND. The statemachine is in
    deadlock now, and the TX_EN remains low, making the interface useless.
    
    imx_uart_stop_tx now checks for incomplete transmission AND whether TC
    interrupts are enabled before bailing to be retriggered. This makes sure
    the state machine handling is reached, and is properly set to
    WAIT_AFTER_SEND.

    base/node.c: initialize the accessor list before registering
    
    [ Upstream commit 48b5928e18dc27e05cab3dc4c78cd8a15baaf1e5 ]
    
    The current code registers the node as available in the node array
    before initializing the accessor list.  This makes it so that
    anything which might access the accessor list as a result of
    allocations will cause an undefined memory access.
    
    In one example, an extension to access hmat data during interleave
    caused this undefined access as a result of a bulk allocation
    that occurs during node initialization but before the accessor
    list is initialized.
    
    Initialize the accessor list before making the node generally
    available to the global system.

    potential to keep enough of the UART around to trigger a use-after-free.

    [ Upstream commit b8b2711336f03ece539de61479d6ffc44fb603d3 ]
    
    When resetting the linear mapping permissions, we must make sure that we
    clear the X bit so that do not end up with WX mappings (since we set
    PAGE_KERNEL).

    riscv: Fix set_memory_XX() and set_direct_map_XX() by splitting huge linear mappings
    
    [ Upstream commit 311cd2f6e25380cff0abc2884dc6a3d33bc9b5c3 ]
    
    When STRICT_KERNEL_RWX is set, any change of permissions on any kernel
    mapping (vmalloc/modules/kernel text...etc) should be applied on its
    linear mapping alias. The problem is that the riscv kernel uses huge
    mappings for the linear mapping and walk_page_range_novma() does not
    split those huge mappings.
    
    So this patchset implements such split in order to apply fine-grained
    permissions on the linear mapping.
    
    Below is the difference before and after (the first PUD mapping is split
    into PTE/PMD mappings):

    riscv: Fix module_alloc() that did not reset the linear mapping permissions
    
    [ Upstream commit 749b94b08005929bbc636df21a23322733166e35 ]
    
    After unloading a module, we must reset the linear mapping permissions,
    see the example below:

    0xffffaf809d6e1000-0xffffaf809d6e7000    0x000000011d6e1000        24K PTE .   ..     ..   D A G . X . R V
    
    After unloading a module:
    
    0xffffaf809d65d000-0xffffaf809d6e1000    0x000000011d65d000       528K PTE .   ..     ..   D A G . . W R V

    The last mapping is not reset and we end up with WX mappings in the linear
    mapping.
    
    So add VM_FLUSH_RESET_PERMS to our module_alloc() definition.

    mips: Fix incorrect max_low_pfn adjustment
    
    [ Upstream commit 0f5cc249ff73552d3bd864e62f85841dafaa107d ]
    
    max_low_pfn variable is incorrectly adjusted if the kernel is built with
    high memory support and the later is detected in a running system, so the
    memory which actually can be directly mapped is getting into the highmem
    zone. See the ZONE_NORMAL range on my MIPS32r5 system:
    
    > Zone ranges:
    >   DMA      [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000ffffff]
    >   Normal   [mem 0x0000000001000000-0x0000000007ffffff]
    >   HighMem  [mem 0x0000000008000000-0x000000020fffffff]
    
    while the zones are supposed to look as follows:
    
    > Zone ranges:
    >   DMA      [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000ffffff]
    >   Normal   [mem 0x0000000001000000-0x000000001fffffff]
    >   HighMem  [mem 0x0000000020000000-0x000000020fffffff]
    
    Even though the physical memory within the range [0x08000000;0x20000000]
    belongs to MMIO on our system, we don't really want it to be considered as
    high memory since on MIPS32 that range still can be directly mapped.
    
    Note there might be other problems caused by the max_low_pfn variable
    misconfiguration. For instance high_memory variable is initialize with
    virtual address corresponding to the max_low_pfn PFN, and by design it
    must define the upper bound on direct map memory, then end of the normal
    zone. That in its turn potentially may cause problems in accessing the
    memory by means of the /dev/mem and /dev/kmem devices.
    
    Let's fix the discovered misconfiguration then. It turns out the commit
    a94e4f24ec83 ("MIPS: init: Drop boot_mem_map") didn't introduce the
    max_low_pfn adjustment quite correct. If the kernel is built with high
    memory support and the system is equipped with high memory, the
    max_low_pfn variable will need to be initialized with PFN of the most
    upper directly reachable memory address so the zone normal would be
    correctly setup. On MIPS that PFN corresponds to PFN_DOWN(HIGHMEM_START).
    If the system is built with no high memory support and one is detected in
    the running system, we'll just need to adjust the max_pfn variable to
    discard the found high memory from the system and leave the max_low_pfn as
    is, since the later will be less than PFN_DOWN(HIGHMEM_START) anyway by

    mips: dmi: Fix early remap on MIPS32
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d0a3748a2cb38f9da1f08d357688ebd982eb788 ]
    
    dmi_early_remap() has been defined as ioremap_cache() which on MIPS32 gets
    to be converted to the VM-based mapping. DMI early remapping is performed
    at the setup_arch() stage with no VM available. So calling the
    dmi_early_remap() for MIPS32 causes the system to crash at the early boot
    time. Fix that by converting dmi_early_remap() to the uncached remapping
    which is always available on both 32 and 64-bits MIPS systems.
    
    Note this change shall not cause any regressions on the current DMI
    support implementation because on the early boot-up stage neither MIPS32
    nor MIPS64 has the cacheable ioremapping support anyway.

    commit 6d710b769c1f5f0d55c9ad9bb49b7dce009ec103 upstream.
    
    The original comment is confusing because it implies that variants other
    than the SC16IS762 supports other SPI modes beside SPI_MODE_0.
    
    Extract from datasheet:
        The SC16IS762 differs from the SC16IS752 in that it supports SPI clock
        speeds up to 15 Mbit/s instead of the 4 Mbit/s supported by the
        SC16IS752... In all other aspects, the SC16IS762 is functionally and
        electrically the same as the SC16IS752.
    
    The same is also true of the SC16IS760 variant versus the SC16IS740 and
    SC16IS750 variants.
    
    For all variants, only SPI mode 0 is supported.
    
    Change comment and abort probing if the specified SPI mode is not
    SPI_MODE_0.

    HID: wacom: Correct behavior when processing some confidence == false touches
    
    commit 502296030ec6b0329e00f9fb15018e170cc63037 upstream.
    
    There appear to be a few different ways that Wacom devices can deal with
    confidence:
    
      1. If the device looses confidence in a touch, it will first clear
         the tipswitch flag in one report, and then clear the confidence
         flag in a second report. This behavior is used by e.g. DTH-2452.
    
      2. If the device looses confidence in a touch, it will clear both
         the tipswitch and confidence flags within the same report. This
         behavior is used by some AES devices.
    
      3. If the device looses confidence in a touch, it will clear *only*
         the confidence bit. The tipswitch bit will remain set so long as
         the touch is tracked. This behavior may be used in future devices.
    
    The driver does not currently handle situation 3 properly. Touches that
    loose confidence will remain "in prox" and essentially frozen in place
    until the tipswitch bit is finally cleared. Not only does this result
    in userspace seeing a stuck touch, but it also prevents pen arbitration
    from working properly (the pen won't send events until all touches are
    up, but we don't currently process events from non-confident touches).
    
    This commit centralizes the checking of the confidence bit in the
    wacom_wac_finger_slot() function and has 'prox' depend on it. In the
    case where situation 3 is encountered, the treat the touch as though
    it was removed, allowing both userspace and the pen arbitration to
    act normally.

    Previous version of ad7091r event handler received the ADC state pointer

    However, no driver data have ever been set, which led to null pointer

    Pass the iio device to the event handler and retrieve the ADC state struct
    from it so we avoid the null pointer dereference and save the driver from
    filling the driver data field.

    KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Avoid potential UAF in LPI translation cache
    
    commit ad362fe07fecf0aba839ff2cc59a3617bd42c33f upstream.
    
    There is a potential UAF scenario in the case of an LPI translation
    cache hit racing with an operation that invalidates the cache, such
    as a DISCARD ITS command. The root of the problem is that
    vgic_its_check_cache() does not elevate the refcount on the vgic_irq
    before dropping the lock that serializes refcount changes.
    
    Have vgic_its_check_cache() raise the refcount on the returned vgic_irq
    and add the corresponding decrement after queueing the interrupt.

    KVM: arm64: vgic-v4: Restore pending state on host userspace write
    
    commit 7b95382f965133ef61ce44aaabc518c16eb46909 upstream.
    
    When the VMM writes to ISPENDR0 to set the state pending state of
    an SGI, we fail to convey this to the HW if this SGI is already
    backed by a GICv4.1 vSGI.
    
    This is a bit of a corner case, as this would only occur if the
    vgic state is changed on an already running VM, but this can
    apparently happen across a guest reset driven by the VMM.
    
    Fix this by always writing out the pending_latch value to the
    HW, and reseting it to false.

    The interrupt status can be cleared even if the MSI status remains pending.

    commit 2217fffcd63f86776c985d42e76daa43a56abdf1 upstream.
    
    Commit 6f5e193bfb55 ("PCI: dwc: Fix dw_pcie_ep_raise_msix_irq() to get
    correct MSI-X table address") modified dw_pcie_ep_raise_msix_irq() to
    support iATUs which require a specific alignment.
    
    However, this support cannot have been properly tested.
    
    The whole point is for the iATU to map an address that is aligned,
    using dw_pcie_ep_map_addr(), and then let the writel() write to
    ep->msi_mem + aligned_offset.
    
    Thus, modify the address that is mapped such that it is aligned.
    With this change, dw_pcie_ep_raise_msix_irq() matches the logic in
    dw_pcie_ep_raise_msi_irq().

    The decoder_populate_targets() helper walks all of the targets in a port
    and makes sure they can be looked up in @target_map. Where @target_map
    is a lookup table from target position to target id (corresponding to a
    cxl_dport instance). However @target_map is only responsible for
    conveying the active dport instances as indicated by interleave_ways.
    
    When nr_targets > interleave_ways it results in
    decoder_populate_targets() walking off the end of the valid entries in
    @target_map. Given target_map is initialized to 0 it results in the
    dport lookup failing if position 0 is not mapped to a dport with an id
    of 0:
    
      cxl_port port3: Failed to populate active decoder targets
      cxl_port port3: Failed to add decoder
      cxl_port port3: Failed to add decoder3.0
      cxl_bus_probe: cxl_port port3: probe: -6
    
    This bug also highlights that when the decoder's ->targets[] array is
    written in cxl_port_setup_targets() it is missing a hold of the
    targets_lock to synchronize against sysfs readers of the target list. A
    fix for that is saved for a later patch.

    Revert "net: rtnetlink: Enslave device before bringing it up"
    
    commit ec4ffd100ffb396eca13ebe7d18938ea80f399c3 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit a4abfa627c3865c37e036bccb681619a50d3d93c.
    
    The patch broke:
    > ip link set dummy0 up
    > ip link set dummy0 master bond0 down
    
    This last command is useful to be able to enslave an interface with only
    one netlink message.
    
    After discussion, there is no good reason to support:
    > ip link set dummy0 down
    > ip link set dummy0 master bond0 up
    because the bond interface already set the slave up when it is up.

    wifi: mwifiex: configure BSSID consistently when starting AP
    
    commit f0dd488e11e71ac095df7638d892209c629d9af2 upstream.
    
    AP BSSID configuration is missing at AP start.  Without this fix, FW returns
    STA interface MAC address after first init.  When hostapd restarts, it gets MAC
    address from netdev before driver sets STA MAC to netdev again. Now MAC address
    between hostapd and net interface are different causes STA cannot connect to
    AP.  After that MAC address of uap0 mlan0 become the same. And issue disappears
    after following hostapd restart (another issue is AP/STA MAC address become the
    same).
    
    This patch fixes the issue cleanly.

    wifi: rtlwifi: Convert LNKCTL change to PCIe cap RMW accessors
    
    commit 5894d0089cbc146063dcc0239a78ede0a8142efb upstream.
    
    The rtlwifi driver comes with custom code to write into PCIe Link
    Control register. RMW access for the Link Control register requires
    locking that is already provided by the standard PCIe capability
    accessors.
    
    Convert the custom RMW code writing into LNKCTL register to standard
    RMW capability accessors. The accesses are changed to cover the full
    LNKCTL register instead of touching just a single byte of the register.

    wifi: rtlwifi: Remove bogus and dangerous ASPM disable/enable code
    
    commit b3943b3c2971444364e03224cfc828c5789deada upstream.
    
    Ever since introduction in the commit 0c8173385e54 ("rtl8192ce: Add new
    driver") the rtlwifi code has, according to comments, attempted to
    disable/enable ASPM of the upstream bridge by writing into its LNKCTL
    register. However, the code has never been correct because it performs
    the writes to the device instead of the upstream bridge.
    
    Worse yet, the offset where the PCIe capabilities reside is derived
    from the offset of the upstream bridge. As a result, the write will use
    an offset on the device that does not relate to the LNKCTL register
    making the ASPM disable/enable code outright dangerous.
    
    Because of those problems, there is no indication that the driver needs
    disable/enable ASPM on the upstream bridge. As the Capabilities offset
    is not correctly calculated for the write to target device's LNKCTL
    register, the code is not disabling/enabling device's ASPM either.
    Therefore, just remove the upstream bridge related ASPM disable/enable
    code entirely.
    
    The upstream bridge related ASPM code was the only user of the struct
    mp_adapter members num4bytes, pcibridge_pciehdr_offset, and
    pcibridge_linkctrlreg so those are removed as well.
    
    Note: This change does not remove the code related to changing the
    device's ASPM on purpose (which is independent of this flawed code
    related to upstream bridge's ASPM).

    wifi: mt76: fix broken precal loading from MTD for mt7915
    
    commit e874a79250b39447765ac13272b67ac36ccf2a75 upstream.
    
    Commit 495184ac91bb ("mt76: mt7915: add support for applying
    pre-calibration data") was fundamentally broken and never worked.
    
    The idea (before NVMEM support) was to expand the MTD function and pass
    an additional offset. For normal EEPROM load the offset would always be
    0. For the purpose of precal loading, an offset was passed that was
    internally the size of EEPROM, since precal data is right after the
    EEPROM.
    
    Problem is that the offset value passed is never handled and is actually
    overwrite by
    
            offset = be32_to_cpup(list);
            ret = mtd_read(mtd, offset, len, &retlen, eep);
    
    resulting in the passed offset value always ingnored. (and even passing
    garbage data as precal as the start of the EEPROM is getting read)
    
    Fix this by adding to the current offset value, the offset from DT to
    correctly read the piece of data at the requested location.

    iommu/dma: Trace bounce buffer usage when mapping buffers
    
    commit a63c357b9fd56ad5fe64616f5b22835252c6a76a upstream.
    
    When commit 82612d66d51d ("iommu: Allow the dma-iommu api to
    use bounce buffers") was introduced, it did not add the logic
    for tracing the bounce buffer usage from iommu_dma_map_page().
    
    All of the users of swiotlb_tbl_map_single() trace their bounce
    buffer usage, except iommu_dma_map_page(). This makes it difficult
    to track SWIOTLB usage from that function. Thus, trace bounce buffer
    usage from iommu_dma_map_page().

    iommu/arm-smmu-qcom: Add missing GMU entry to match table
    
    commit afc95681c3068956fed1241a1ff1612c066c75ac upstream.
    
    In some cases the firmware expects cbndx 1 to be assigned to the GMU,
    so we also want the default domain for the GMU to be an identy domain.
    This way it does not get a context bank assigned.  Without this, both
    of_dma_configure() and drm/msm's iommu_domain_attach() will trigger
    allocating and configuring a context bank.  So GMU ends up attached to
    both cbndx 1 and later cbndx 2.  This arrangement seemingly confounds
    and surprises the firmware if the GPU later triggers a translation
    fault, resulting (on sc8280xp / lenovo x13s, at least) in the SMMU
    getting wedged and the GPU stuck without memory access.

    LoongArch: Fix and simplify fcsr initialization on execve()
    
    commit c2396651309eba291c15e32db8fbe44c738b5921 upstream.
    
    There has been a lingering bug in LoongArch Linux systems causing some
    GCC tests to intermittently fail (see Closes link).  I've made a minimal
    reproducer:
    
        zsh% cat measure.s
        .align 4
        .globl _start
        _start:
            movfcsr2gr  $a0, $fcsr0
            bstrpick.w  $a0, $a0, 16, 16
            beqz        $a0, .ok
            break       0
        .ok:
            li.w        $a7, 93
            syscall     0
        zsh% cc mesaure.s -o measure -nostdlib
        zsh% echo $((1.0/3))
        0.33333333333333331
        zsh% while ./measure; do ; done
    
    This while loop should not stop as POSIX is clear that execve must set
    fenv to the default, where FCSR should be zero.  But in fact it will
    just stop after running for a while (normally less than 30 seconds).
    Note that "$((1.0/3))" is needed to reproduce this issue because it
    raises FE_INVALID and makes fcsr0 non-zero.
    
    The problem is we are currently relying on SET_PERSONALITY2() to reset
    current->thread.fpu.fcsr.  But SET_PERSONALITY2() is executed before
    start_thread which calls lose_fpu(0).  We can see if kernel preempt is
    enabled, we may switch to another thread after SET_PERSONALITY2() but
    before lose_fpu(0).  Then bad thing happens: during the thread switch
    the value of the fcsr0 register is stored into current->thread.fpu.fcsr,
    making it dirty again.
    
    The issue can be fixed by setting current->thread.fpu.fcsr after
    lose_fpu(0) because lose_fpu() clears TIF_USEDFPU, then the thread
    switch won't touch current->thread.fpu.fcsr.
    
    The only other architecture setting FCSR in SET_PERSONALITY2() is MIPS.
    I've ran a similar test on MIPS with mainline kernel and it turns out
    MIPS is buggy, too.  Anyway MIPS do this for supporting different FP
    flavors (NaN encodings, etc.) which do not exist on LoongArch.  So for
    LoongArch, we can simply remove the current->thread.fpu.fcsr setting
    from SET_PERSONALITY2() and do it in start_thread(), after lose_fpu(0).
    
    The while loop failing with the mainline kernel has survived one hour
    after this change on LoongArch.

    Bluetooth: Fix atomicity violation in {min,max}_key_size_set
    
    commit da9065caa594d19b26e1a030fd0cc27bd365d685 upstream.
    
    In min_key_size_set():
        if (val > hdev->le_max_key_size || val < SMP_MIN_ENC_KEY_SIZE)
            return -EINVAL;
        hci_dev_lock(hdev);
        hdev->le_min_key_size = val;
        hci_dev_unlock(hdev);
    
    In max_key_size_set():
        if (val > SMP_MAX_ENC_KEY_SIZE || val < hdev->le_min_key_size)
            return -EINVAL;
        hci_dev_lock(hdev);
        hdev->le_max_key_size = val;
        hci_dev_unlock(hdev);
    
    The atomicity violation occurs due to concurrent execution of set_min and
    set_max funcs.Consider a scenario where setmin writes a new, valid 'min'
    value, and concurrently, setmax writes a value that is greater than the
    old 'min' but smaller than the new 'min'. In this case, setmax might check
    against the old 'min' value (before acquiring the lock) but write its
    value after the 'min' has been updated by setmin. This leads to a
    situation where the 'max' value ends up being smaller than the 'min'
    value, which is an inconsistency.
    
    This possible bug is found by an experimental static analysis tool
    developed by our team, BassCheck[1]. This tool analyzes the locking APIs
    to extract function pairs that can be concurrently executed, and then
    analyzes the instructions in the paired functions to identify possible
    concurrency bugs including data races and atomicity violations. The above
    possible bug is reported when our tool analyzes the source code of
    Linux 5.17.
    
    To resolve this issue, it is suggested to encompass the validity checks
    within the locked sections in both set_min and set_max funcs. The
    modification ensures that the validation of 'val' against the
    current min/max values is atomic, thus maintaining the integrity of the
    settings. With this patch applied, our tool no longer reports the bug,
    with the kernel configuration allyesconfig for x86_64. Due to the lack of
    associated hardware, we cannot test the patch in runtime testing, and just
    verify it according to the code logic.

    rootfs: Fix support for rootfstype= when root= is given
    
    commit 21528c69a0d8483f7c6345b1a0bc8d8975e9a172 upstream.
    
    Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.rst states:
    
      If CONFIG_TMPFS is enabled, rootfs will use tmpfs instead of ramfs by
      default.  To force ramfs, add "rootfstype=ramfs" to the kernel command
      line.
    
    This currently does not work when root= is provided since then
    saved_root_name contains a string and rootfstype= is ignored. Therefore,
    ramfs is currently always chosen when root= is provided.
    
    The current behavior for rootfs's filesystem is:
    
       root=       | rootfstype= | chosen rootfs filesystem
       ------------+-------------+--------------------------
       unspecified | unspecified | tmpfs
       unspecified | tmpfs       | tmpfs
       unspecified | ramfs       | ramfs
        provided   | ignored     | ramfs
    
    rootfstype= should be respected regardless whether root= is given,
    as shown below:
    
       root=       | rootfstype= | chosen rootfs filesystem
       ------------+-------------+--------------------------
       unspecified | unspecified | tmpfs  (as before)
       unspecified | tmpfs       | tmpfs  (as before)
       unspecified | ramfs       | ramfs  (as before)
        provided   | unspecified | ramfs  (compatibility with before)
        provided   | tmpfs       | tmpfs  (new)
        provided   | ramfs       | ramfs  (new)
    
    This table represents the new behavior.

    pwm: jz4740: Don't use dev_err_probe() in .request()
    
    commit 9320fc509b87b4d795fb37112931e2f4f8b5c55f upstream.
    
    dev_err_probe() is only supposed to be used in probe functions. While it
    probably doesn't hurt, both the EPROBE_DEFER handling and calling
    device_set_deferred_probe_reason() are conceptually wrong in the request
    callback. So replace the call by dev_err() and a separate return
    statement.
    
    This effectively reverts commit c0bfe9606e03 ("pwm: jz4740: Simplify

    block: add check that partition length needs to be aligned with block size
    
    commit 6f64f866aa1ae6975c95d805ed51d7e9433a0016 upstream.
    
    Before calling add partition or resize partition, there is no check
    on whether the length is aligned with the logical block size.
    If the logical block size of the disk is larger than 512 bytes,
    then the partition size maybe not the multiple of the logical block size,
    and when the last sector is read, bio_truncate() will adjust the bio size,
    resulting in an IO error if the size of the read command is smaller than
    the logical block size.If integrity data is supported, this will also
    result in a null pointer dereference when calling bio_integrity_free.

    The callers of vfs_iter_write() are required to hold file_start_write().
    file_start_write() is a no-op for the S_ISBLK() case, but it is really
    needed when the backing file is a regular file.
    
    We are going to move file_{start,end}_write() into vfs_iter_write(), but
    we need to fix this first, so that the fix could be backported to stable
    kernels.

    fbdev: flush deferred IO before closing
    
    commit 33cd6ea9c0673517cdb06ad5c915c6f22e9615fc upstream.
    
    When framebuffer gets closed, the queued deferred IO gets cancelled. This
    can cause some last display data to vanish. This is problematic for users
    who send a still image to the framebuffer, then close the file: the image
    may never appear.
    
    To ensure none of display data get lost, flush the queued deferred IO
    first before closing.
    
    Another possible solution is to delete the cancel_delayed_work_sync()
    instead. The difference is that the display may appear some time after
    closing. However, the clearing of page mapping after this needs to be
    removed too, because the page mapping is used by the deferred work. It is
    not completely obvious whether it is okay to not clear the page mapping.
    For a patch intended for stable trees, go with the simple and obvious
    solution.

    fbdev: flush deferred work in fb_deferred_io_fsync()
    
    commit 15e4c1f462279b4e128f27de48133e0debe9e0df upstream.
    
    The driver's fsync() is supposed to flush any pending operation to
    hardware. It is implemented in this driver by cancelling the queued
    deferred IO first, then schedule it for "immediate execution" by calling
    schedule_delayed_work() again with delay=0. However, setting delay=0
    only means the work is scheduled immediately, it does not mean the work
    is executed immediately. There is no guarantee that the work is finished
    after schedule_delayed_work() returns. After this driver's fsync()
    returns, there can still be pending work. Furthermore, if close() is
    called by users immediately after fsync(), the pending work gets
    cancelled and fsync() may do nothing.
    
    To ensure that the deferred IO completes, use flush_delayed_work()
    instead. Write operations to this driver either write to the device
    directly, or invoke schedule_delayed_work(); so by flushing the
    workqueue, it can be guaranteed that all previous writes make it to the
    device.

    If IOSQE_ASYNC is set and we fail importing an iovec for a readv or

    eventual failure CQE posted can potentially have a random res value
    rather than the expected -EINVAL.

    drm/vmwgfx: Keep a gem reference to user bos in surfaces
    
    commit 91398b413d03660fd5828f7b4abc64e884b98069 upstream.
    
    Surfaces can be backed (i.e. stored in) memory objects (mob's) which
    are created and managed by the userspace as GEM buffers. Surfaces
    grab only a ttm reference which means that the gem object can
    be deleted underneath us, especially in cases where prime buffer
    export is used.
    
    Make sure that all userspace surfaces which are backed by gem objects
    hold a gem reference to make sure they're not deleted before vmw
    surfaces are done with them, which fixes:

    drm/vmwgfx: Fix possible invalid drm gem put calls
    
    commit f9e96bf1905479f18e83a3a4c314a8dfa56ede2c upstream.
    
    vmw_bo_unreference sets the input buffer to null on exit, resulting in
    null ptr deref's on the subsequent drm gem put calls.
    
    This went unnoticed because only very old userspace would be exercising
    those paths but it wouldn't be hard to hit on old distros with brand
    new kernels.
    
    Introduce a new function that abstracts unrefing of user bo's to make
    the code cleaner and more explicit.

    serial: omap: do not override settings for RS485 support
    
    commit 51f93776b84dee23e44a7be880736669a01cec2b upstream.
    
    The drivers RS485 support is deactivated if there is no RTS GPIO available.
    This is done by nullifying the ports rs485_supported struct. After that
    however the settings in serial_omap_rs485_supported are assigned to the
    same structure unconditionally, which results in an unintended reactivation
    of RS485 support.
    
    Fix this by moving the assignment to the beginning of
    serial_omap_probe_rs485() and thus before uart_get_rs485_mode() gets
    called.
    
    Also replace the assignment of rs485_config() to have the complete RS485
    setup in one function.

    serial: 8250_exar: Set missing rs485_supported flag
    
    commit 0c2a5f471ce58bca8f8ab5fcb911aff91eaaa5eb upstream.
    
    The UART supports an auto-RTS mode in which the RTS pin is automatically
    activated during transmission. So mark this mode as being supported even
    if RTS is not controlled by the driver but the UART.
    
    Also the serial core expects now at least one of both modes rts-on-send or
    rts-after-send to be supported. This is since during sanitization
    unsupported flags are deleted from a RS485 configuration set by userspace.
    However if the configuration ends up with both flags unset, the core prints
    a warning since it considers such a configuration invalid (see
    uart_sanitize_serial_rs485()).

    serial: imx: Ensure that imx_uart_rs485_config() is called with enabled clock
    
    commit 7c45eaa813476bd195ac1227a64b52f9cf2e2030 upstream.
    
    There are register accesses in the function imx_uart_rs485_config(). The
    clock must be enabled for these accesses. This was ensured by calling it
    via the function uart_rs485_config() in the probe() function within the
    range where the clock is enabled. With the commit 7c7f9bc986e6 ("serial:
    Deassert Transmit Enable on probe in driver-specific way") it was removed
    from the probe() function and is now only called through the function
    uart_add_one_port() which is located at the end of the probe() function.
    But the clock is already switched off in this area. To ensure that the
    clock is enabled during register access, move the disabling of the clock
    to the very end of the probe() function. To avoid leaking enabled clocks
    on error also add an error path for exiting with disabling the clock.

    serial: core, imx: do not set RS485 enabled if it is not supported
    
    commit 74eab89b26ac433ad857292f4707b43c1a8f0209 upstream.
    
    If the imx driver cannot support RS485 it nullifies the ports
    rs485_supported structure. But it still calls uart_get_rs485_mode() which
    may set the RS485_ENABLED flag nevertheless.
    
    This may lead to an attempt to configure RS485 even if it is not supported
    when the flag is evaluated in uart_configure_port() at port startup.
    
    Avoid this by bailing out of uart_get_rs485_mode() if the RS485_ENABLED
    flag is not supported by the caller.
    
    With this fix a check for RTS availability is now obsolete in the imx
    driver, since it can not evaluate to true any more. So remove this check.
    
    Furthermore the explicit nullifcation of rs485_supported is not needed,
    since the memory has already been set to zeros at allocation. So remove
    this, too.

    In these cases userspace may be able to activate RS485 via TIOCSRS485
    nevertheless, since in uart_set_rs485_config() an existing rs485_config()
    function indicates that RS485 is supported.
    
    Make sure that this is not longer possible by checking the uarts
    rs485_supported.flags instead and bailing out if SER_RS485_ENABLED is not
    set.
    
    Furthermore instead of returning an empty structure return -ENOTTY if the
    RS485 configuration is requested via TIOCGRS485 but RS485 is not supported.
    This has a small impact on userspace visibility but it is consistent with
    the -ENOTTY error for TIOCGRS485.

    serial: core: fix sanitizing check for RTS settings
    
    commit 4afeced55baa391490b61ed9164867e2927353ed upstream.
    
    Among other things uart_sanitize_serial_rs485() tests the sanity of the RTS
    settings in a RS485 configuration that has been passed by userspace.
    If RTS-on-send and RTS-after-send are both set or unset the configuration
    is adjusted and RTS-after-send is disabled and RTS-on-send enabled.
    
    This however makes only sense if both RTS modes are actually supported by
    the driver.
    
    With commit be2e2cb1d281 ("serial: Sanitize rs485_struct") the code does
    take the driver support into account but only checks if one of both RTS
    modes are supported. This may lead to the errorneous result of RTS-on-send
    being set even if only RTS-after-send is supported.
    
    Fix this by changing the implemented logic: First clear all unsupported
    flags in the RS485 configuration, then adjust an invalid RTS setting by
    taking into account which RTS mode is supported.

    usb: mon: Fix atomicity violation in mon_bin_vma_fault
    
    commit 2dd23cc4d0e6aa55cf9fb3b05f2f4165b01de81c upstream.
    
    In mon_bin_vma_fault():
        offset = vmf->pgoff << PAGE_SHIFT;
        if (offset >= rp->b_size)
            return VM_FAULT_SIGBUS;
        chunk_idx = offset / CHUNK_SIZE;
        pageptr = rp->b_vec[chunk_idx].pg;
    The code is executed without holding any lock.
    
    In mon_bin_vma_close():
        spin_lock_irqsave(&rp->b_lock, flags);
        rp->mmap_active--;
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&rp->b_lock, flags);
    
    In mon_bin_ioctl():
        spin_lock_irqsave(&rp->b_lock, flags);
        if (rp->mmap_active) {
            ...
        } else {
            ...
            kfree(rp->b_vec);
            rp->b_vec  = vec;
            rp->b_size = size;
            ...
        }
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&rp->b_lock, flags);
    
    Concurrent execution of mon_bin_vma_fault() with mon_bin_vma_close() and
    mon_bin_ioctl() could lead to atomicity violations. mon_bin_vma_fault()
    accesses rp->b_size and rp->b_vec without locking, risking array
    out-of-bounds access or use-after-free bugs due to possible modifications
    in mon_bin_ioctl().
    
    This possible bug is found by an experimental static analysis tool
    developed by our team, BassCheck[1]. This tool analyzes the locking APIs
    to extract function pairs that can be concurrently executed, and then
    analyzes the instructions in the paired functions to identify possible
    concurrency bugs including data races and atomicity violations. The above
    possible bug is reported when our tool analyzes the source code of
    Linux 6.2.
    
    To address this issue, it is proposed to add a spin lock pair in
    mon_bin_vma_fault() to ensure atomicity. With this patch applied, our tool
    never reports the possible bug, with the kernel configuration allyesconfig
    for x86_64. Due to the lack of associated hardware, we cannot test the
    patch in runtime testing, and just verify it according to the code logic.

    usb: typec: class: fix typec_altmode_put_partner to put plugs
    
    commit 5962ded777d689cd8bf04454273e32228d7fb71f upstream.
    
    When typec_altmode_put_partner is called by a plug altmode upon release,
    the port altmode the plug belongs to will not remove its reference to the
    plug. The check to see if the altmode being released is a plug evaluates
    against the released altmode's partner instead of the calling altmode, so
    change adev in typec_altmode_put_partner to properly refer to the altmode
    being released.
    
    Because typec_altmode_set_partner calls get_device() on the port altmode,
    add partner_adev that points to the port altmode in typec_put_partner to
    call put_device() on. typec_altmode_set_partner is not called for port
    altmodes, so add a check in typec_altmode_release to prevent
    typec_altmode_put_partner() calls on port altmode release.

    usb: cdns3: Fix uvc fail when DMA cross 4k boundery since sg enabled
    
    commit 40c304109e866a7dc123661a5c8ca72f6b5e14e0 upstream.
    
    Supposed DMA cross 4k bounder problem should be fixed at DEV_VER_V2, but
    still met problem when do ISO transfer if sg enabled.
    
    Data pattern likes below when sg enabled, package size is 1k and mult is 2
            [UVC Header(8B) ] [data(3k - 8)] ...
    
    The received data at offset 0xd000 will get 0xc000 data, len 0x70. Error
    happen position as below pattern:
            0xd000: wrong
            0xe000: wrong
            0xf000: correct
            0x10000: wrong
            0x11000: wrong
            0x12000: correct
            ...
    
    To avoid DMA cross 4k bounder at ISO transfer, reduce burst len according
    to start DMA address's alignment.

    usb: cdns3: fix iso transfer error when mult is not zero
    
    commit 92f02efa1d86d7dcaef7f38a5fe3396c4e88a93c upstream.
    
    ISO basic transfer is
            ITP(SOF) Package_0 Package_1 ... Package_n
    
    CDNS3 DMA start dma transfer from memmory to internal FIFO when get SOF,
    controller will transfer data to usb bus from internal FIFO when get IN
    token.
    
    According USB spec defination:
            Maximum number of packets = (bMaxBurst + 1) * (Mult + 1)
    
    Internal memory should be the same as (bMaxBurst + 1) * (Mult + 1). DMA
    don't fetch data advance when ISO transfer, so only reserve
    (bMaxBurst + 1) * (Mult + 1) internal memory for ISO transfer.
    
    Need save Mult and bMaxBurst information and set it into EP_CFG register,
    otherwise only 1 package is sent by controller, other package will be
    lost.

    usb: cdns3: fix uvc failure work since sg support enabled
    
    commit 1b8be5ecff26201bafb0a554c74e91571299fb94 upstream.
    
    When IP version >= DEV_VER_V2, gadget:sg_supported is true. So uvc gadget
    function driver will use sg to equeue data, first is 8bytes header, the
    second is 1016bytes data.
    
        cdns3_prepare_trb: ep2in: trb 0000000000ac755f, dma buf: 0xbf455000, size: 8, burst: 128 ctrl: 0x00000415 (C=1, T=0, ISP, CHAIN, Normal)
        cdns3_prepare_trb: ep2in: trb 00000000a574e693, dma buf: 0xc0200fe0, size: 1016, burst: 128 ctrl: 0x00000405 (C=1, T=0, ISP, Normal)
    
    But cdns3_ep_run_transfer() can't correctly handle this case, which only
    support one TRB for ISO transfer.
    
    The controller requires duplicate the TD for each SOF if priv_ep->interval
    is not 1. DMA will read data from DDR to internal FIFO when get SOF. Send
    data to bus when receive IN token. DMA always refill FIFO when get SOF
    regardless host send IN token or not. If host send IN token later, some
    frames data will be lost.
    
    Fixed it by below major steps:
    
    1. Calculate numembers of TRB base on sg_nums and priv_ep->interval.
    2. Remove CHAIN flags for each end TRB of TD when duplicate TD.
    3. The controller requires LINK TRB must be first TRB of TD. When check
    there are not enough TRBs lefts, just fill LINK TRB for left TRBs.
    
    .... CHAIN_TRB DATA_TRB, CHAIN_TRB DATA_TRB,  LINK_TRB ... LINK_TRB
                                                               ^End of TRB List

    usb: chipidea: wait controller resume finished for wakeup irq
    
    commit 128d849074d05545becf86e713715ce7676fc074 upstream.
    
    After the chipidea driver introduce extcon for id and vbus, it's able
    to wakeup from another irq source, in case the system with extcon ID
    cable, wakeup from usb ID cable and device removal, the usb device
    disconnect irq may come firstly before the extcon notifier while system
    resume, so we will get 2 "wakeup" irq, one for usb device disconnect;
    and one for extcon ID cable change(real wakeup event), current driver
    treat them as 2 successive wakeup irq so can't handle it correctly, then
    finally the usb irq can't be enabled. This patch adds a check to bypass
    further usb events before controller resume finished to fix it.

    Don't omit soft-reset. During initialization, the driver may need to
    perform a soft reset to ensure the phy is ready when the controller
    updates the GCTL.PRTCAPDIR or other settings by issuing phy soft-reset.
    Many platforms often have access to DCTL register for soft-reset despite
    being host-only. If there are actual reported issues from the platforms
    that don't expose DCTL registers, then we will need to revisit (perhaps
    to teach dwc3 to perform xhci's soft-reset USBCMD.HCRST).

    By this time if pending_list is not empty, it will get the next request

    commit ff2b89de471da942a4d853443688113a44fd35ed upstream.
    
    When CONFIG_USB_OTG is not set, mxs_phy_is_otg_host() will always return
    false. This behaviour is wrong. Since phy.last_event will always be set
    for either host or device mode. Therefore, CONFIG_USB_OTG condition
    can be removed.

    tick-sched: Fix idle and iowait sleeptime accounting vs CPU hotplug
    
    commit 71fee48fb772ac4f6cfa63dbebc5629de8b4cc09 upstream.
    
    When offlining and onlining CPUs the overall reported idle and iowait
    times as reported by /proc/stat jump backward and forward:
    
    cpu  132 0 176 225249 47 6 6 21 0 0
    cpu0 80 0 115 112575 33 3 4 18 0 0
    cpu1 52 0 60 112673 13 3 1 2 0 0
    
    cpu  133 0 177 226681 47 6 6 21 0 0
    cpu0 80 0 116 113387 33 3 4 18 0 0
    
    cpu  133 0 178 114431 33 6 6 21 0 0 <---- jump backward
    cpu0 80 0 116 114247 33 3 4 18 0 0
    cpu1 52 0 61 183 0 3 1 2 0 0        <---- idle + iowait start with 0
    
    cpu  133 0 178 228956 47 6 6 21 0 0 <---- jump forward
    cpu0 81 0 117 114929 33 3 4 18 0 0
    
    Reason for this is that get_idle_time() in fs/proc/stat.c has different
    sources for both values depending on if a CPU is online or offline:
    
    - if a CPU is online the values may be taken from its per cpu
      tick_cpu_sched structure
    
    - if a CPU is offline the values are taken from its per cpu cpustat
      structure
    
    The problem is that the per cpu tick_cpu_sched structure is set to zero on
    CPU offline. See tick_cancel_sched_timer() in kernel/time/tick-sched.c.
    
    Therefore when a CPU is brought offline and online afterwards both its idle
    and iowait sleeptime will be zero, causing a jump backward in total system
    idle and iowait sleeptime. In a similar way if a CPU is then brought
    offline again the total idle and iowait sleeptimes will jump forward.
    
    It looks like this behavior was introduced with commit 4b0c0f294f60
    ("tick: Cleanup NOHZ per cpu data on cpu down").
    
    This was only noticed now on s390, since we switched to generic idle time
    reporting with commit be76ea614460 ("s390/idle: remove arch_cpu_idle_time()
    and corresponding code").
    
    Fix this by preserving the values of idle_sleeptime and iowait_sleeptime
    members of the per-cpu tick_sched structure on CPU hotplug.

    powerpc/64s: Increase default stack size to 32KB
    
    commit 18f14afe281648e31ed35c9ad2fcb724c4838ad9 upstream.
    
    There are reports of kernels crashing due to stack overflow while
    running OpenShift (Kubernetes). The primary contributor to the stack
    usage seems to be openvswitch, which is used by OVN-Kubernetes (based on
    OVN (Open Virtual Network)), but NFS also contributes in some stack
    traces.
    
    There may be some opportunities to reduce stack usage in the openvswitch
    code, but doing so potentially require tradeoffs vs performance, and
    also requires testing across architectures.
    
    Looking at stack usage across the kernel (using -fstack-usage), shows
    that ppc64le stack frames are on average 50-100% larger than the
    equivalent function built for x86-64. Which is not surprising given the
    minimum stack frame size is 32 bytes on ppc64le vs 16 bytes on x86-64.
    
    So increase the default stack size to 32KB for the modern 64-bit Book3S
    platforms, ie. pseries (virtualised) and powernv (bare metal). That
    leaves the older systems like G5s, and the AmigaOne (pasemi) with a 16KB
    stack which should be sufficient on those machines.

    binder: fix race between mmput() and do_exit()
    
    commit 9a9ab0d963621d9d12199df9817e66982582d5a5 upstream.
    
    Task A calls binder_update_page_range() to allocate and insert pages on
    a remote address space from Task B. For this, Task A pins the remote mm
    via mmget_not_zero() first. This can race with Task B do_exit() and the
    final mmput() refcount decrement will come from Task A.
    
      Task A            | Task B
      ------------------+------------------
      mmget_not_zero()  |
                        |  do_exit()
                        |    exit_mm()
                        |      mmput()
      mmput()           |
        exit_mmap()     |
          remove_vma()  |
            fput()      |
    
    In this case, the work of ____fput() from Task B is queued up in Task A
    as TWA_RESUME. So in theory, Task A returns to userspace and the cleanup
    work gets executed. However, Task A instead sleep, waiting for a reply
    from Task B that never comes (it's dead).
    
    This means the binder_deferred_release() is blocked until an unrelated
    binder event forces Task A to go back to userspace. All the associated
    death notifications will also be delayed until then.
    
    In order to fix this use mmput_async() that will schedule the work in
    the corresponding mm->async_put_work WQ instead of Task A.

    xen-netback: don't produce zero-size SKB frags
    
    commit c7ec4f2d684e17d69bbdd7c4324db0ef5daac26a upstream.
    
    While frontends may submit zero-size requests (wasting a precious slot),
    core networking code as of at least 3ece782693c4b ("sock: skb_copy_ubufs
    support for compound pages") can't deal with SKBs when they have all
    zero-size fragments. Respond to empty requests right when populating
    fragments; all further processing is fragment based and hence won't
    encounter these empty requests anymore.
    
    In a way this should have been that way from the beginning: When no data
    is to be transferred for a particular request, there's not even a point
    in validating the respective grant ref. That's no different from e.g.
    passing NULL into memcpy() when at the same time the size is 0.
    
    This is XSA-448 / CVE-2023-46838.

    binder: fix unused alloc->free_async_space
    
    commit c6d05e0762ab276102246d24affd1e116a46aa0c upstream.
    
    Each transaction is associated with a 'struct binder_buffer' that stores
    the metadata about its buffer area. Since commit 74310e06be4d ("android:
    binder: Move buffer out of area shared with user space") this struct is
    no longer embedded within the buffer itself but is instead allocated on
    the heap to prevent userspace access to this driver-exclusive info.
    
    Unfortunately, the space of this struct is still being accounted for in
    the total buffer size calculation, specifically for async transactions.
    This results in an additional 104 bytes added to every async buffer
    request, and this area is never used.
    
    This wasted space can be substantial. If we consider the maximum mmap
    buffer space of SZ_4M, the driver will reserve half of it for async
    transactions, or 0x200000. This area should, in theory, accommodate up
    to 262,144 buffers of the minimum 8-byte size. However, after adding
    the extra 'sizeof(struct binder_buffer)', the total number of buffers
    drops to only 18,724, which is a sad 7.14% of the actual capacity.
    
    This patch fixes the buffer size calculation to enable the utilization
    of the entire async buffer space. This is expected to reduce the number
    of -ENOSPC errors that are seen on the field.

    fbdev: imxfb: fix left margin setting
    
    [ Upstream commit 5758844105f7dd9a0a04990cd92499a1a593dd36 ]
    
    The previous setting did not take into account the CSTN mode.
    For the H_WAIT_2 bitfield (bits 0-7) of the LCDC Horizontal Configuration
    Register (LCDCR), the IMX25RM manual states that:
    
    In TFT mode, it specifies the number of SCLK periods between the end of
    HSYNC and the beginning of OE signal, and the total delay time equals
    (H_WAIT_2 + 3) of SCLK periods.
    In CSTN mode, it specifies the number of SCLK periods between the end of
    HSYNC and the first display data in each line, and the total delay time
    equals (H_WAIT_2 + 2) of SCLK periods.
    
    The patch handles both cases.

    of: Fix double free in of_parse_phandle_with_args_map
    
    [ Upstream commit 4dde83569832f9377362e50f7748463340c5db6b ]
    
    In of_parse_phandle_with_args_map() the inner loop that
    iterates through the map entries calls of_node_put(new)
    to free the reference acquired by the previous iteration
    of the inner loop. This assumes that the value of "new" is
    NULL on the first iteration of the inner loop.
    
    Make sure that this is true in all iterations of the outer
    loop by setting "new" to NULL after its value is assigned to "cur".
    
    Extend the unittest to detect the double free and add an additional
    test case that actually triggers this path.

    IB/iser: Prevent invalidating wrong MR
    
    [ Upstream commit 2f1888281e67205bd80d3e8f54dbd519a9653f26 ]
    
    The iser_reg_resources structure has two pointers to MR but only one
    mr_valid field. The implementation assumes that we use only *sig_mr when
    pi_enable is true. Otherwise, we use only *mr. However, it is only
    sometimes correct. Read commands without protection information occur even
    when pi_enble is true. For example, the following SCSI commands have a
    Data-In buffer but never have protection information: READ CAPACITY (16),
    INQUIRY, MODE SENSE(6), MAINTENANCE IN. So, we use
    *sig_mr for some SCSI commands and *mr for the other SCSI commands.
    
    In most cases, it works fine because the remote invalidation is applied.
    However, there are two cases when the remote invalidation is not
    applicable.
     1. Small write commands when all data is sent as an immediate.
     2. The target does not support the remote invalidation feature.
    
    The lazy invalidation is used if the remote invalidation is impossible.
    Since, at the lazy invalidation, we always invalidate the MR we want to
    use, the wrong MR may be invalidated.
    
    To fix the issue, we need a field per MR that indicates the MR needs
    invalidation. Since the ib_mr structure already has such a field, let's
    use ib_mr.need_inval instead of iser_reg_resources.mr_valid.

    drm/mediatek: dp: Add phy_mtk_dp module as pre-dependency
    
    [ Upstream commit c8048dd0b07df68724805254b9e994d99e9a7af4 ]
    
    The mtk_dp driver registers a phy device which is handled by the
    phy_mtk_dp driver and assumes that the phy probe will complete
    synchronously, proceeding to make use of functionality exposed by that
    driver right away. This assumption however is false when the phy driver
    is built as a module, causing the mtk_dp driver to fail probe in this
    case.
    
    Add the phy_mtk_dp module as a pre-dependency to the mtk_dp module to
    ensure the phy module has been loaded before the dp, so that the phy
    probe happens synchrounously and the mtk_dp driver can probe
    successfully even with the phy driver built as a module.

    [ Upstream commit f33f5b1fd1be5f5106d16f831309648cb0f1c31d ]
    
    Users report about the unexpected behavior for setting timeouts above
    15 sec on Raspberry Pi. According to watchdog-api.rst the ioctl
    WDIOC_SETTIMEOUT shouldn't fail because of hardware limitations.
    But looking at the code shows that max_timeout based on the
    register value PM_WDOG_TIME_SET, which is the maximum.
    
    Since 664a39236e71 ("watchdog: Introduce hardware maximum heartbeat
    in watchdog core") the watchdog core is able to handle this problem.
    
    This fix has been tested with watchdog-test from selftests.

    watchdog/hpwdt: Only claim UNKNOWN NMI if from iLO
    
    [ Upstream commit dced0b3e51dd2af3730efe14dd86b5e3173f0a65 ]
    
    Avoid unnecessary crashes by claiming only NMIs that are due to
    ERROR signalling or generated by the hpwdt hardware device.
    
    The code does this, but only for iLO5.
    
    The intent was to preserve legacy, Gen9 and earlier, semantics of
    using hpwdt for error containtment as hardware/firmware would signal
    fatal IO errors as an NMI with the expectation of hpwdt crashing
    the system.  Howerver, these IO errors should be received by hpwdt
    as an NMI_IO_CHECK.  So the test is overly permissive and should
    not be limited to only ilo5.
    
    We need to enable this protection for future iLOs not matching the
    current PCI IDs.

    watchdog: set cdev owner before adding
    
    [ Upstream commit 38d75297745f04206db9c29bdd75557f0344c7cc ]
    
    When the new watchdog character device is registered, it becomes
    available for opening. This creates a race where userspace may open the
    device before the character device's owner is set. This results in an
    imbalance in module_get calls as the cdev_get in cdev_open will not
    increment the reference count on the watchdog driver module.
    
    This causes problems when the watchdog character device is released as
    the module loader's reference will also be released. This makes it
    impossible to open the watchdog device later on as it now appears that
    the module is being unloaded. The open will fail with -ENXIO from
    chrdev_open.
    
    The legacy watchdog device will fail with -EBUSY from the try_module_get
    in watchdog_open because it's module owner is the watchdog core module
    so it can still be opened but it will fail to get a refcount on the
    underlying watchdog device driver.

    drivers: clk: zynqmp: calculate closest mux rate
    
    [ Upstream commit b782921ddd7f84f524723090377903f399fdbbcb ]
    
    Currently zynqmp clock driver is not calculating closest mux rate and
    because of that Linux is not setting proper frequency for CPU and
    not able to set given frequency for dynamic frequency scaling.
    
    E.g., In current logic initial acpu clock parent and frequency as below
    apll1                  0    0    0  2199999978    0     0  50000      Y
        acpu0_mux          0    0    0  2199999978    0     0  50000      Y
            acpu0_idiv1    0    0    0  2199999978    0     0  50000      Y
                acpu0      0    0    0  2199999978    0     0  50000      Y
    
    After changing acpu frequency to 549999994 Hz using CPU freq scaling its
    selecting incorrect parent which is not closest frequency.
    rpll_to_xpd            0    0    0  1599999984    0     0  50000      Y
        acpu0_mux          0    0    0  1599999984    0     0  50000      Y
            acpu0_div1     0    0    0   533333328    0     0  50000      Y
                acpu0      0    0    0   533333328    0     0  50000      Y
    
    Parent should remain same since 549999994 = 2199999978 / 4.
    
    So use __clk_mux_determine_rate_closest() generic function to calculate
    closest rate for mux clock. After this change its selecting correct
    parent and correct clock rate.

    [ Upstream commit 71f130c9193f613d497f7245365ed05ffdb0a401 ]
    
    When the driver was ported upstream, PLL test_ctl_hi1 register value
    was omitted. Add it to ensure the PLLs are fully configured.

    drm/amd/pm: fix a double-free in amdgpu_parse_extended_power_table
    
    [ Upstream commit a6582701178a47c4d0cb2188c965c59c0c0647c8 ]
    
    The amdgpu_free_extended_power_table is called in every error-handling
    paths of amdgpu_parse_extended_power_table. However, after the following
    call chain of returning:
    
    amdgpu_parse_extended_power_table
      |-> kv_dpm_init / si_dpm_init
          (the only two caller of amdgpu_parse_extended_power_table)
            |-> kv_dpm_sw_init / si_dpm_sw_init
                (the only caller of kv_dpm_init / si_dpm_init, accordingly)
                  |-> kv_dpm_fini / si_dpm_fini
                      (goto dpm_failed in xx_dpm_sw_init)
                        |-> amdgpu_free_extended_power_table
    
    As above, the amdgpu_free_extended_power_table is called twice in this
    returning chain and thus a double-free is triggered. Similarily, the
    last kfree in amdgpu_parse_extended_power_table also cause a double free
    with amdgpu_free_extended_power_table in kv_dpm_fini.

    The adev->pm.dpm.ps is used in the for loop of kv_dpm_fini after its

    [ Upstream commit da235d2fac212d0add570e755feb1167a830bc99 ]
    
    The hardware manual of both RZ/G2L and RZ/G3S specifies that the reset
    monitor registers need to be interrogated when the reset signals are
    toggled (chapters "Procedures for Supplying and Stopping Reset Signals"
    and "Procedure for Activating Modules").  Without this, there is a
    chance that different modules (e.g. Ethernet) are not ready after their
    reset signal is toggled, leading to failures (on probe or resume from
    deep sleep states).
    
    The same indications are available for RZ/V2M for TYPE-B reset controls.

    drm/panel: st7701: Fix AVCL calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit 799825aa87200ade1ba21db853d1c2ff720dcfe0 ]
    
    The AVCL register, according to the datasheet, comes in increments
    of -0.2v between -4.4v (represented by 0x0) to -5.0v (represented
    by 0x3). The current calculation is done by adding the defined
    AVCL value in mV to -4400 and then dividing by 200 to get the register
    value. Unfortunately if I subtract -4400 from -4400 I get -8800, which
    divided by 200 gives me -44. If I instead subtract -4400 from -4400
    I get 0, which divided by 200 gives me 0. Based on the datasheet this
    is the expected register value.

    drm/panfrost: Ignore core_mask for poweroff and disable PWRTRANS irq
    
    [ Upstream commit a4f5892914ca7709ea6d191f0edace93a5935966 ]
    
    Some SoCs may be equipped with a GPU containing two core groups
    and this is exactly the case of Samsung's Exynos 5422 featuring
    an ARM Mali-T628 MP6 GPU: the support for this GPU in Panfrost
    is partial, as this driver currently supports using only one
    core group and that's reflected on all parts of it, including
    the power on (and power off, previously to this patch) function.
    
    The issue with this is that even though executing the soft reset
    operation should power off all cores unconditionally, on at least
    one platform we're seeing a crash that seems to be happening due
    to an interrupt firing which may be because we are calling power
    transition only on the first core group, leaving the second one
    unchanged, or because ISR execution was pending before entering
    the panfrost_gpu_power_off() function and executed after powering
    off the GPU cores, or all of the above.
    
    Finally, solve this by:
     - Avoid to enable the power transition interrupt on reset; and
     - Ignoring the core_mask and ask the GPU to poweroff both core groups

    [ Upstream commit c6721b3c6423d8a348ae885a0f4c85e14f9bf85c ]
    
    Flush queued events when disabling the crtc. This avoids timeouts when
    we come back and wait for dependencies (like the previous frame's
    flip_done).

    ASoC: cs35l34: Fix GPIO name and drop legacy include
    
    [ Upstream commit a6122b0b4211d132934ef99e7b737910e6d54d2f ]
    
    This driver includes the legacy GPIO APIs <linux/gpio.h> and
    <linux/of_gpio.h> but does not use any symbols from any of
    them.
    
    Drop the includes.
    
    Further the driver is requesting "reset-gpios" rather than
    just "reset" from the GPIO framework. This is wrong because
    the gpiolib core will add "-gpios" before processing the
    request from e.g. device tree. Drop the suffix.
    
    The last problem means that the optional RESET GPIO has
    never been properly retrieved and used even if it existed,
    but nobody noticed.

    drm/tidss: Fix dss reset
    
    [ Upstream commit bc288a927815efcf9d7f4a54d4d89c5df478c635 ]
    
    The probe function calls dispc_softreset() before runtime PM is enabled
    and without enabling any of the DSS clocks. This happens to work by
    luck, and we need to make sure the DSS HW is active and the fclk is
    enabled.
    
    To fix the above, add a new function, dispc_init_hw(), which does:
    
    - pm_runtime_set_active()
    - clk_prepare_enable(fclk)
    - dispc_softreset().
    
    This ensures that the reset can be successfully accomplished.
    
    Note that we use pm_runtime_set_active(), not the normal
    pm_runtime_get(). The reason for this is that at this point we haven't
    enabled the runtime PM yet and also we don't want the normal resume
    callback to be called: the dispc resume callback does some initial HW
    setup, and it expects that the HW was off (no video ports are
    streaming). If the bootloader has enabled the DSS and has set up a
    boot time splash-screen, the DSS would be enabled and streaming which
    might lead to issues with the normal resume callback.

    We do a DSS reset in the middle of the dispc_init(). While that happens
    to work now, we should really make sure that e..g the fclk, which is
    acquired only later in the function, is enabled when doing a reset. This
    will be handled in a later patch, but for now, let's move the
    dispc_softreset() call to the end of dispc_init(), which is a sensible
    place for it anyway.

    drm/bridge: tpd12s015: Drop buggy __exit annotation for remove function
    
    [ Upstream commit ce3e112e7ae854249d8755906acc5f27e1542114 ]
    
    With tpd12s015_remove() marked with __exit this function is discarded
    when the driver is compiled as a built-in. The result is that when the
    driver unbinds there is no cleanup done which results in resource
    leakage or worse.

    drm/nouveau/fence:: fix warning directly dereferencing a rcu pointer
    
    [ Upstream commit 5f35a624c1e30b5bae5023b3c256e94e0ad4f806 ]
    
    Fix a sparse warning with this message
    "warning:dereference of noderef expression". In this context it means we
    are dereferencing a __rcu tagged pointer directly.
    
    We should not be directly dereferencing a rcu pointer. To get a normal
    (non __rcu tagged pointer) from a __rcu tagged pointer we are using the
    function unrcu_pointer(...). The non __rcu tagged pointer then can be
    dereferenced just like a normal pointer.
    
    I tested with qemu with this command
    qemu-system-x86_64 \
            -m 2G \

    drm/panel-elida-kd35t133: hold panel in reset for unprepare
    
    [ Upstream commit 03c5b2a5f6c39fe4e090346536cf1c14ee18b61e ]
    
    For devices like the Anbernic RG351M and RG351P the panel is wired to
    an always on regulator. When the device suspends and wakes up, there
    are some slight artifacts on the screen that go away over time. If
    instead we hold the panel in reset status after it is unprepared,
    this does not happen.

    drm/panfrost: Really power off GPU cores in panfrost_gpu_power_off()
    
    [ Upstream commit 22aa1a209018dc2eca78745f7666db63637cd5dc ]
    
    The layout of the registers {TILER,SHADER,L2}_PWROFF_LO, used to request
    powering off cores, is the same as the {TILER,SHADER,L2}_PWRON_LO ones:
    this means that in order to request poweroff of cores, we are supposed
    to write a bitmask of cores that should be powered off!
    This means that the panfrost_gpu_power_off() function has always been
    doing nothing.
    
    Fix powering off the GPU by writing a bitmask of the cores to poweroff
    to the relevant PWROFF_LO registers and then check that the transition
    (from ON to OFF) has finished by polling the relevant PWRTRANS_LO
    registers.
    
    While at it, in order to avoid code duplication, move the core mask
    logic from panfrost_gpu_power_on() to a new panfrost_get_core_mask()
    function, used in both poweron and poweroff.

    ip6_tunnel: fix NEXTHDR_FRAGMENT handling in ip6_tnl_parse_tlv_enc_lim()
    
    [ Upstream commit d375b98e0248980681e5e56b712026174d617198 ]
    
    syzbot pointed out [1] that NEXTHDR_FRAGMENT handling is broken.
    
    Reading frag_off can only be done if we pulled enough bytes
    to skb->head. Currently we might access garbage.

    mlxbf_gige: Enable the GigE port in mlxbf_gige_open
    
    [ Upstream commit a460f4a684511e007bbf1700758a41f05d9981e6 ]
    
    At the moment, the GigE port is enabled in the mlxbf_gige_probe
    function. If the mlxbf_gige_open is not executed, this could cause
    pause frames to increase in the case where there is high backgroud
    traffic. This results in clogging the port.
    So move enabling the OOB port to mlxbf_gige_open.

    mlxbf_gige: Fix intermittent no ip issue
    
    [ Upstream commit ef210ef85d5cb543ce34a57803ed856d0c8c08c2 ]
    
    Although the link is up, there is no ip assigned on setups with high background
    traffic. Nothing is transmitted nor received. The RX error count keeps on
    increasing. After several minutes, the RX error count stagnates and the
    GigE interface finally gets an ip.
    
    The issue is that mlxbf_gige_rx_init() is called before phy_start().
    As soon as the RX DMA is enabled in mlxbf_gige_rx_init(), the RX CI reaches the max
    of 128, and becomes equal to RX PI. RX CI doesn't decrease since the code hasn't
    ran phy_start yet.
    Bring the PHY up before starting the RX.

    net/sched: act_ct: fix skb leak and crash on ooo frags
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f14b377d01d8357eba032b4cabc8c1149b458b6 ]
    
    act_ct adds skb->users before defragmentation. If frags arrive in order,
    the last frag's reference is reset in:
    
      inet_frag_reasm_prepare
        skb_morph
    
    which is not straightforward.
    
    However when frags arrive out of order, nobody unref the last frag, and
    all frags are leaked. The situation is even worse, as initiating packet
    capture can lead to a crash[0] when skb has been cloned and shared at the
    same time.
    
    Fix the issue by removing skb_get() before defragmentation. act_ct
    returns TC_ACT_CONSUMED when defrag failed or in progress.

    [ Upstream commit 4746b36b1abe11ca32987b2d21e1e770deab17cc ]
    
    For some reason sctp_poll() generates EPOLLERR if sk->sk_error_queue
    is not empty but recvmsg() can not drain the error queue yet.
    
    This is needed to better support timestamping.
    
    I had to export inet_recv_error(), since sctp
    can be compiled as a module.

    bpf: sockmap, fix proto update hook to avoid dup calls
    
    [ Upstream commit 16b2f264983dc264c1560cc0170e760dec1bf54f ]
    
    When sockets are added to a sockmap or sockhash we allocate and init a
    psock. Then update the proto ops with sock_map_init_proto the flow is
    
      sock_hash_update_common
        sock_map_link
          psock = sock_map_psock_get_checked() <-returns existing psock
          sock_map_init_proto(sk, psock)       <- updates sk_proto
    
    If the socket is already in a map this results in the sock_map_init_proto
    being called multiple times on the same socket. We do this because when
    a socket is added to multiple maps this might result in a new set of BPF
    programs being attached to the socket requiring an updated ops struct.
    
    This creates a rule where it must be safe to call psock_update_sk_prot
    multiple times. When we added a fix for UAF through unix sockets in patch
    4dd9a38a753fc we broke this rule by adding a sock_hold in that path
    to ensure the sock is not released. The result is if a af_unix stream sock
    is placed in multiple maps it results in a memory leak because we call
    sock_hold multiple times with only a single sock_put on it.

    null_blk: don't cap max_hw_sectors to BLK_DEF_MAX_SECTORS
    
    [ Upstream commit 9a9525de865410047fa962867b4fcd33943b206f ]
    
    null_blk has some rather odd capping of the max_hw_sectors value to
    BLK_DEF_MAX_SECTORS, which doesn't make sense - max_hw_sector is the
    hardware limit, and BLK_DEF_MAX_SECTORS despite the confusing name is the
    default cap for the max_sectors field used for normal file system I/O.
    
    Remove all the capping, and simply leave it to the block layer or
    user to take up or not all of that for file system I/O.

    netfilter: nf_tables: mark newset as dead on transaction abort
    
    [ Upstream commit 08e4c8c5919fd405a4d709b4ba43d836894a26eb ]
    
    If a transaction is aborted, we should mark the to-be-released NEWSET dead,
    just like commit path does for DEL and DESTROYSET commands.
    
    In both cases all remaining elements will be released via
    set->ops->destroy().
    
    The existing abort code does NOT post the actual release to the work queue.
    Also the entire __nf_tables_abort() function is wrapped in gc_seq
    begin/end pair.
    
    Therefore, async gc worker will never try to release the pending set
    elements, as gc sequence is always stale.
    
    It might be possible to speed up transaction aborts via work queue too,
    this would result in a race and a possible use-after-free.
    
    So fix this before it becomes an issue.

    soc: qcom: llcc: Fix dis_cap_alloc and retain_on_pc configuration
    
    [ Upstream commit eed6e57e9f3e2beac37563eb6a0129549daa330e ]
    
    Commit c14e64b46944 ("soc: qcom: llcc: Support chipsets that can
     write to llcc") add the support for chipset where capacity based
    allocation and retention through power collapse can be programmed
    based on content of SCT table mentioned in the llcc driver where
    the target like sdm845 where the entire programming related to it
    is controlled in firmware. However, the commit introduces a bug
    where capacity/retention register get overwritten each time it
    gets programmed for each slice and that results in misconfiguration
    of the register based on SCT table and that is not expected
    behaviour instead it should be read modify write to retain the
    configuration of other slices.
    
    This issue is totally caught from code review and programming test
    and not through any power/perf numbers so, it is not known what
    impact this could make if we don't have this change however,
    this feature are for these targets and they should have been
    programmed accordingly as per their configuration mentioned in
    SCT table like others bits information.
    
    This change brings one difference where it keeps capacity/retention
    bits of the slices that are not mentioned in SCT table in unknown
    state where as earlier it was initialized to zero.

    Add one more condition for sending credit update during dequeue from

    SO_RCVLOWAT value of the socket. This is actual for non-default value
    of SO_RCVLOWAT (e.g. not 1) - idea is to "kick" peer to continue data
    transmission, because we need at least SO_RCVLOWAT bytes in our rx
    queue to wake up user for reading data (in corner case it is also
    possible to stuck both tx and rx sides, this is why 'Fixes' is used).

    [ Upstream commit bb7403655b3c3eb245d0ee330047cd3e20b3c4af ]
    
    In order to support IP_PKTINFO on those packets, we need to call
    ipv4_pktinfo_prepare.
    
    When sending mrouted/pimd daemons a cache report IGMP msg, it is
    unnecessary to set dst on the newly created skb.
    It used to be necessary on older versions until
    commit d826eb14ecef ("ipv4: PKTINFO doesnt need dst reference") which
    changed the way IP_PKTINFO struct is been retrieved.
    
    Changes from v1:
    1. Undo changes in ipv4_pktinfo_prepare function. use it directly

    This is not correct, as a kernel or bootloader compatible with the non-SCMI

    bpf: Fix verification of indirect var-off stack access
    
    [ Upstream commit a833a17aeac73b33f79433d7cee68d5cafd71e4f ]
    
    This patch fixes a bug around the verification of possibly-zero-sized
    stack accesses. When the access was done through a var-offset stack
    pointer, check_stack_access_within_bounds was incorrectly computing the
    maximum-offset of a zero-sized read to be the same as the register's min
    offset. Instead, we have to take in account the register's maximum
    possible value. The patch also simplifies how the max offset is checked;
    the check is now simpler than for min offset.
    
    The bug was allowing accesses to erroneously pass the
    check_stack_access_within_bounds() checks, only to later crash in
    check_stack_range_initialized() when all the possibly-affected stack
    slots are iterated (this time with a correct max offset).
    check_stack_range_initialized() is relying on
    check_stack_access_within_bounds() for its accesses to the
    stack-tracking vector to be within bounds; in the case of zero-sized
    accesses, we were essentially only verifying that the lowest possible
    slot was within bounds. We would crash when the max-offset of the stack
    pointer was >= 0 (which shouldn't pass verification, and hopefully is
    not something anyone's code attempts to do in practice).
    
    Thanks Hao for reporting!

    The ieee80211_queue_work function queues work into the mac80211
    local->workqueue, which is widely used for mac80211 internal
    work processes. In the mt76 driver, both the mt76-sido-status and
    mt76-sdio-net threads enqueue workers to the workqueue with this
    function. However, in some cases, when two workers are enqueued
    to the workqueue almost simultaneously, the second worker may not
    be scheduled immediately and may get stuck for a while.
    This can cause timing issues. To avoid these timing
    conflicts caused by worker scheduling, replace the worker
    with an independent thread.

    arm64: dts: qcom: sc7280: Fix up GPU SIDs
    
    [ Upstream commit 94085049fdad7a36fe14dd55e72e712fe55d6bca ]
    
    GPU_SMMU SID 1 is meant for Adreno LPAC (Low Priority Async Compute).
    On platforms that support it (in firmware), it is necessary to
    describe that link, or Adreno register access will hang the board.
    
    The current settings are functionally identical, *but* due to what is
    likely hardcoded security policies, the secure firmware rejects them,
    resulting in the board hanging. To avoid that, alter the settings such
    that SID 0 and 1 are described separately.

    slot_type[BPF_REG_SIZE - 1] (plus potentially few more below it,

    spilled register we need to consult slot_type[7], not slot_type[0].
    
    To avoid the need to remember and double-check this in the future, just
    use is_spilled_reg() helper.

    bpf: Defer the free of inner map when necessary
    
    [ Upstream commit 876673364161da50eed6b472d746ef88242b2368 ]
    
    When updating or deleting an inner map in map array or map htab, the map
    may still be accessed by non-sleepable program or sleepable program.
    However bpf_map_fd_put_ptr() decreases the ref-counter of the inner map
    directly through bpf_map_put(), if the ref-counter is the last one
    (which is true for most cases), the inner map will be freed by
    ops->map_free() in a kworker. But for now, most .map_free() callbacks
    don't use synchronize_rcu() or its variants to wait for the elapse of a
    RCU grace period, so after the invocation of ops->map_free completes,
    the bpf program which is accessing the inner map may incur
    use-after-free problem.
    
    Fix the free of inner map by invoking bpf_map_free_deferred() after both
    one RCU grace period and one tasks trace RCU grace period if the inner
    map has been removed from the outer map before. The deferment is
    accomplished by using call_rcu() or call_rcu_tasks_trace() when
    releasing the last ref-counter of bpf map. The newly-added rcu_head
    field in bpf_map shares the same storage space with work field to
    reduce the size of bpf_map.

    bpf: Add map and need_defer parameters to .map_fd_put_ptr()
    
    [ Upstream commit 20c20bd11a0702ce4dc9300c3da58acf551d9725 ]
    
    map is the pointer of outer map, and need_defer needs some explanation.
    need_defer tells the implementation to defer the reference release of
    the passed element and ensure that the element is still alive before
    the bpf program, which may manipulate it, exits.
    
    The following three cases will invoke map_fd_put_ptr() and different
    need_defer values will be passed to these callers:
    
    1) release the reference of the old element in the map during map update
       or map deletion. The release must be deferred, otherwise the bpf
       program may incur use-after-free problem, so need_defer needs to be
       true.
    2) release the reference of the to-be-added element in the error path of
       map update. The to-be-added element is not visible to any bpf
       program, so it is OK to pass false for need_defer parameter.
    3) release the references of all elements in the map during map release.
       Any bpf program which has access to the map must have been exited and
       released, so need_defer=false will be OK.
    
    These two parameters will be used by the following patches to fix the
    potential use-after-free problem for map-in-map.

    and per-cpu statistics on update/delete operations.

    As an accident of implementation, an RCU Tasks Trace grace period also
    acts as an RCU grace period.  However, this could change at any time.
    This commit therefore creates an rcu_trace_implies_rcu_gp() that currently
    returns true to codify this accident.  Code relying on this accident
    must call this function to verify that this accident is still happening.

    arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Make watchdog bark interrupt edge triggered
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ac90b4cf107a3999b30844d7899e0331686b33b ]
    
    On sc7180 when the watchdog timer fires your logs get filled with:
      watchdog0: pretimeout event
      watchdog0: pretimeout event
      watchdog0: pretimeout event
      ...
      watchdog0: pretimeout event
    
    If you're using console-ramoops to debug crashes the above gets quite
    annoying since it blows away any other log messages that might have
    been there.
    
    The issue is that the "bark" interrupt (AKA the "pretimeout"
    interrupt) remains high until the watchdog is pet. Since we've got
    things configured as "level" triggered we'll keep getting interrupted
    over and over.
    
    Let's switch to edge triggered. Now we'll get one interrupt when the
    "bark" interrupt goes off and won't get another one until the "bark"
    interrupt is cleared and asserts again.
    
    This matches how many older Qualcomm SoCs have things configured.

    [ Upstream commit b57160859263c083c49482b0d083a586b1517f78 ]
    
    DSS irq trigger type is set to IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING in the DT file, but
    the TRM says it is level triggered.
    
    For some reason triggering on rising edge results in double the amount
    of expected interrupts, e.g. for normal page flipping test the number of
    interrupts per second is 2 * fps. It is as if the IRQ triggers on both
    edges. There are no other side effects to this issue than slightly
    increased CPU & power consumption due to the extra interrupt.
    
    Switching to IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH is correct and fixes the issue, so
    let's do that.

    In some meson boards, secure monitor device has children, for example,
    power secure controller. By default, secure monitor isn't the bus in terms

    net/ncsi: Fix netlink major/minor version numbers
    
    [ Upstream commit 3084b58bfd0b9e4b5e034f31f31b42977db35f12 ]
    
    The netlink interface for major and minor version numbers doesn't actually
    return the major and minor version numbers.
    
    It reports a u32 that contains the (major, minor, update, alpha1)
    components as the major version number, and then alpha2 as the minor
    version number.
    
    For whatever reason, the u32 byte order was reversed (ntohl): maybe it was
    assumed that the encoded value was a single big-endian u32, and alpha2 was
    the minor version.
    
    The correct way to get the supported NC-SI version from the network
    controller is to parse the Get Version ID response as described in 8.4.44
    of the NC-SI spec[1].
    
        Get Version ID Response Packet Format
    
                  Bits
                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
         Bytes  | 31..24 | 23..16 | 15..8  | 7..0   |
        +-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
        | 0..15 | NC-SI Header                      |
        +-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
        | 16..19| Response code   | Reason code     |
        +-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
        |20..23 | Major  | Minor  | Update | Alpha1 |
        +-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
        |24..27 |         reserved         | Alpha2 |
        +-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
        |            .... other stuff ....          |
    
    The major, minor, and update fields are all binary-coded decimal (BCD)
    encoded [2]. The spec provides examples below the Get Version ID response
    format in section 8.4.44.1, but for practical purposes, this is an example
    from a live network card:

    This should be parsed as "1.1.0".
    
    "f" in the upper-nibble means to ignore it, contributing zero.
    
    If both nibbles are "f", I think the whole field is supposed to be ignored.
    Major and minor are "required", meaning they're not supposed to be "ff",
    but the update field is "optional" so I think it can be ff. I think the
    simplest thing to do is just set the major and minor to zero instead of
    juggling some conditional logic or something.
    
    bcd2bin() from "include/linux/bcd.h" seems to assume both nibbles are 0-9,
    so I've provided a custom BCD decoding function.
    
    Alpha1 and alpha2 are ISO/IEC 8859-1 encoded, which just means ASCII
    characters as far as I can tell, although the full encoding table for
    non-alphabetic characters is slightly different (I think).
    
    I imagine the alpha fields are just supposed to be alphabetic characters,
    but I haven't seen any network cards actually report a non-zero value for
    either.
    
    If people wrote software against this netlink behavior, and were parsing
    the major and minor versions themselves from the u32, then this would
    definitely break their code.

    wifi: ath11k: Defer on rproc_get failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 2a3ec40b98b46c339adb57313d3b933ee5e7a8e8 ]
    
    If we already have gotten the rproc_handle (meaning the "qcom,rproc"
    property is defined in the devicetree), it's a valid state that the
    remoteproc module hasn't probed yet so we should defer probing instead
    of just failing to probe.
    
    This resolves a race condition when the ath11k driver probes and fails
    before the wpss remoteproc driver has probed, like the following:
    
      [    6.232360] ath11k 17a10040.wifi: failed to get rproc
      [    6.232366] ath11k 17a10040.wifi: failed to get rproc: -22
      [    6.232478] ath11k: probe of 17a10040.wifi failed with error -22
           ...
      [    6.252415] remoteproc remoteproc2: 8a00000.remoteproc is available
      [    6.252776] remoteproc remoteproc2: powering up 8a00000.remoteproc
      [    6.252781] remoteproc remoteproc2: Booting fw image qcom/qcm6490/fairphone5/wpss.mdt, size 7188
    
    So, defer the probe if we hit that so we can retry later once the wpss
    remoteproc is available.

    bpf: Add crosstask check to __bpf_get_stack
    
    [ Upstream commit b8e3a87a627b575896e448021e5c2f8a3bc19931 ]
    
    Currently get_perf_callchain only supports user stack walking for
    the current task. Passing the correct *crosstask* param will return
    0 frames if the task passed to __bpf_get_stack isn't the current
    one instead of a single incorrect frame/address. This change
    passes the correct *crosstask* param but also does a preemptive
    check in __bpf_get_stack if the task is current and returns
    -EOPNOTSUPP if it is not.
    
    This issue was found using bpf_get_task_stack inside a BPF
    iterator ("iter/task"), which iterates over all tasks.
    bpf_get_task_stack works fine for fetching kernel stacks
    but because get_perf_callchain relies on the caller to know
    if the requested *task* is the current one (via *crosstask*)
    it was failing in a confusing way.
    
    It might be possible to get user stacks for all tasks utilizing
    something like access_process_vm but that requires the bpf
    program calling bpf_get_task_stack to be sleepable and would
    therefore be a breaking change.

    [ Upstream commit a3c6f4f4d249cecaf2f34471aadbfb4f4ef57298 ]
    
    When testing sahara sha256 speed performance with tcrypt (mode=404) on
    imx53-qsrb board, multiple "Invalid numbers of src SG." errors are
    reported. This was traced to sahara_walk_and_recalc() resizing req->src
    and causing the subsequent dma_map_sg() call to fail.
    
    Now that the previous commit fixed sahara_sha_hw_links_create() to take
    into account the actual request size, rather than relying on sg->length
    values, the resize operation is no longer necessary.
    
    Therefore, remove sahara_walk_and_recalc() and simplify associated logic.

    Both MicroLZMA and DEFLATE algorithms can use short-lived pages on

    However, those short-lived pages are actually added to

    [ Upstream commit 86222a8fc16ec517de8da2604d904c9df3a08e5d ]
    
    In persistent_ram_init_ecc(), on 64-bit arches DIV_ROUND_UP() will return
    64-bit value since persistent_ram_zone::buffer_size has type size_t which
    is derived from the 64-bit *unsigned long*, while the ecc_blocks variable
    this value gets assigned to has (always 32-bit) *int* type.  Even if that
    value fits into *int* type, an overflow is still possible when calculating
    the size_t typed ecc_total variable further below since there's no cast to
    any 64-bit type before multiplication.  Declaring the ecc_blocks variable
    as *size_t* should fix this mess...

    In previous capability register implementation, qm irq related values

            [...]
    
    The reason for this call trace is that when the MSE is disabled, the value
    of capability registers in the BAR space become invalid. This will make the
    subsequent unregister process get the wrong irq vector through capability
    registers and get the wrong irq number by pci_irq_vector().
    
    So add a capability table structure to pre-store the valid value of the irq
    information capability register in qm init process, avoid obtaining invalid
    capability register value after the MSE is disabled.

    - switching between encryption and decryption with the same key is not
      possible, as the hdr flags are only updated when a new setkey() is
      performed
    
    With this change, the key is always sent along with the cryptdata when

    crypto: safexcel - Add error handling for dma_map_sg() calls
    
    [ Upstream commit 87e02063d07708cac5bfe9fd3a6a242898758ac8 ]
    
    Macro dma_map_sg() may return 0 on error. This patch enables
    checks in case of the macro failure and ensures unmapping of
    previously mapped buffers with dma_unmap_sg().
    
    Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with static
    analysis tool SVACE.

    When dma_map_single() fails, wa->address is supposed to be freed
    by the callers of ccp_init_dm_workarea() through ccp_dm_free().
    However, many of the call spots don't expect to have to call
    ccp_dm_free() on failure of ccp_init_dm_workarea(), which may
    lead to a memleak. Let's free wa->address in ccp_init_dm_workarea()
    when dma_map_single() fails.

    mtd: Fix gluebi NULL pointer dereference caused by ftl notifier
    
    [ Upstream commit a43bdc376deab5fff1ceb93dca55bcab8dbdc1d6 ]
    
    If both ftl.ko and gluebi.ko are loaded, the notifier of ftl
    triggers NULL pointer dereference when trying to access
    ‘gluebi->desc’ in gluebi_read().

                                    gluebi->desc - NULL
    
    Detailed reproduction information available at the Link [1],
    
    In the normal case, obtain gluebi->desc in the gluebi_get_device(),
    and access gluebi->desc in the gluebi_read(). However,
    gluebi_get_device() is not executed in advance in the
    ftl_add_mtd() process, which leads to NULL pointer dereference.
    
    The solution for the gluebi module is to run jffs2 on the UBI
    volume without considering working with ftl or mtdblock [2].
    Therefore, this problem can be avoided by preventing gluebi from
    creating the mtdblock device after creating mtd partition of the
    type MTD_UBIVOLUME.

    efivarfs: force RO when remounting if SetVariable is not supported
    
    [ Upstream commit 0e8d2444168dd519fea501599d150e62718ed2fe ]
    
    If SetVariable at runtime is not supported by the firmware we never assign
    a callback for that function. At the same time mount the efivarfs as
    RO so no one can call that.  However, we never check the permission flags
    when someone remounts the filesystem as RW. As a result this leads to a
    crash looking like this:

    calipso: fix memory leak in netlbl_calipso_add_pass()
    
    [ Upstream commit ec4e9d630a64df500641892f4e259e8149594a99 ]
    
    If IPv6 support is disabled at boot (ipv6.disable=1),
    the calipso_init() -> netlbl_calipso_ops_register() function isn't called,
    and the netlbl_calipso_ops_get() function always returns NULL.
    In this case, the netlbl_calipso_add_pass() function allocates memory
    for the doi_def variable but doesn't free it with the calipso_doi_free().
    
    BUG: memory leak

    [ Upstream commit b8f3a396a7ee43e6079176cc0fb8de2b95a23681 ]
    
    It is preferred to use typed property access functions (i.e.
    of_property_read_<type> functions) rather than low-level
    of_get_property/of_find_property functions for reading properties. As
    part of this, convert of_get_property/of_find_property calls to the
    recently added of_property_present() helper when we just want to test
    for presence of a property and nothing more.

    leading to a memory leak that was caught by kmemleak.  Do xa_alloc() before
    devm_add_action_or_reset() so that the list may be cleaned up with
    xa_erase() in the release function.

    Add fields to struct intel_vsec_device, so that core module (which
    creates aux bus devices) can pass private data to the client drivers.
    
    For example there is one vsec device instance per CPU package. On a
    multi package system, this private data can be used to pass the package
    ID. This package id can be used by client drivers to change power
    settings for a specific CPU package by targeting MMIO space of the
    correct PCI device.

    [ Upstream commit 251a41116aebdbb7ff00fbc635b1c1a0f08119e6 ]
    
    Remove static for intel_vsec_add_aux() and export this interface so that
    it can be used by other vsec related modules.
    
    This driver creates aux devices by parsing PCI-VSEC, which allows
    individual drivers to load on those devices. Those driver may further
    create more devices on aux bus by parsing the PCI MMIO region.
    
    For example, TPMI (Topology Aware Register and PM Capsule Interface)
    creates device nodes for power management features by parsing MMIO region.
    
    When TPMI driver creates devices, it can reuse existing function
    intel_vsec_add_aux() to create aux devices with TPMI device as the parent.

    selftests/powerpc: Fix error handling in FPU/VMX preemption tests
    
    [ Upstream commit 9dbd5927408c4a0707de73ae9dd9306b184e8fee ]
    
    The FPU & VMX preemption tests do not check for errors returned by the
    low-level asm routines, preempt_fpu() / preempt_vsx() respectively.
    That means any register corruption detected by the asm routines does not
    result in a test failure.
    
    Fix it by returning the return value of the asm routines from the
    pthread child routines.

    powerpc/pseries/memhp: Fix access beyond end of drmem array
    
    [ Upstream commit bd68ffce69f6cf8ddd3a3c32549d1d2275e49fc5 ]
    
    dlpar_memory_remove_by_index() may access beyond the bounds of the
    drmem lmb array when the LMB lookup fails to match an entry with the
    given DRC index. When the search fails, the cursor is left pointing to
    &drmem_info->lmbs[drmem_info->n_lmbs], which is one element past the
    last valid entry in the array. The debug message at the end of the
    function then dereferences this pointer:
    
            pr_debug("Failed to hot-remove memory at %llx\n",
                     lmb->base_addr);

    EDAC/thunderx: Fix possible out-of-bounds string access
    
    [ Upstream commit 475c58e1a471e9b873e3e39958c64a2d278275c8 ]
    
    Enabling -Wstringop-overflow globally exposes a warning for a common bug
    in the usage of strncat():
    
      drivers/edac/thunderx_edac.c: In function 'thunderx_ocx_com_threaded_isr':
      drivers/edac/thunderx_edac.c:1136:17: error: 'strncat' specified bound 1024 equals destination size [-Werror=stringop-overflow=]
       1136 |                 strncat(msg, other, OCX_MESSAGE_SIZE);
            |                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       ...
    
    Apparently the author of this driver expected strncat() to behave the
    way that strlcat() does, which uses the size of the destination buffer
    as its third argument rather than the length of the source buffer. The
    result is that there is no check on the size of the allocated buffer.
    
    Change it to strlcat().

    x86/mce/inject: Clear test status value
    
    [ Upstream commit 6175b407756b22e7fdc771181b7d832ebdedef5c ]
    
    AMD systems generally allow MCA "simulation" where MCA registers can be
    written with valid data and the full MCA handling flow can be tested by
    software.
    
    However, the platform on Scalable MCA systems, can prevent software from
    writing data to the MCA registers. There is no architectural way to
    determine this configuration. Therefore, the MCE injection module will
    check for this behavior by writing and reading back a test status value.
    This is done during module init, and the check can run on any CPU with
    any valid MCA bank.
    
    If MCA_STATUS writes are ignored by the platform, then there are no side
    effects on the hardware state.
    
    If the writes are not ignored, then the test status value will remain in
    the hardware MCA_STATUS register. It is likely that the value will not
    be overwritten by hardware or software, since the tested CPU and bank
    are arbitrary. Therefore, the user may see a spurious, synthetic MCA
    error reported whenever MCA is polled for this CPU.
    
    Clear the test value immediately after writing it. It is very unlikely
    that a valid MCA error is logged by hardware during the test. Errors
    that cause an #MC won't be affected.

    x86/lib: Fix overflow when counting digits
    
    [ Upstream commit a24d61c609813963aacc9f6ec8343f4fcaac7243 ]
    
    tl;dr: The num_digits() function has a theoretical overflow issue.
    But it doesn't affect any actual in-tree users.  Fix it by using
    a larger type for one of the local variables.
    
    Long version:
    
    There is an overflow in variable m in function num_digits when val
    is >= 1410065408 which leads to the digit calculation loop to
    iterate more times than required. This results in either more
    digits being counted or in some cases (for example where val is
    1932683193) the value of m eventually overflows to zero and the
    while loop spins forever).
    
    Currently the function num_digits is currently only being used for
    small values of val in the SMP boot stage for digit counting on the
    number of cpus and NUMA nodes, so the overflow is never encountered.
    However it is useful to fix the overflow issue in case the function
    is used for other purposes in the future. (The issue was discovered
    while investigating the digit counting performance in various
    kernel helper functions rather than any real-world use-case).
    
    The simplest fix is to make m a long long, the overhead in
    multiplication speed for a long long is very minor for small values
    of val less than 10000 on modern processors. The alternative
    fix is to replace the multiplication with a constant division
    by 10 loop (this compiles down to an multiplication and shift)
    without needing to make m a long long, but this is slightly slower
    than the fix in this commit when measured on a range of x86
    processors).
