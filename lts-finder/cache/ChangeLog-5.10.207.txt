    scsi: core: Always send batch on reset or error handling command
    
    commit 066c5b46b6eaf2f13f80c19500dbb3b84baabb33 upstream.
    
    In commit 8930a6c20791 ("scsi: core: add support for request batching") the
    block layer bd->last flag was mapped to SCMD_LAST and used as an indicator
    to send the batch for the drivers that implement this feature. However, the
    error handling code was not updated accordingly.
    
    scsi_send_eh_cmnd() is used to send error handling commands and request
    sense. The problem is that request sense comes as a single command that
    gets into the batch queue and times out. As a result the device goes
    offline after several failed resets. This was observed on virtio_scsi
    during a device resize operation.
    
    [  496.316946] sd 0:0:4:0: [sdd] tag#117 scsi_eh_0: requesting sense
    [  506.786356] sd 0:0:4:0: [sdd] tag#117 scsi_send_eh_cmnd timeleft: 0
    [  506.787981] sd 0:0:4:0: [sdd] tag#117 abort
    
    To fix this always set SCMD_LAST flag in scsi_send_eh_cmnd() and
    scsi_reset_ioctl().
