    drop_monitor: Require 'CAP_SYS_ADMIN' when joining "events" group
    
    commit e03781879a0d524ce3126678d50a80484a513c4b upstream.
    
    The "NET_DM" generic netlink family notifies drop locations over the
    "events" multicast group. This is problematic since by default generic
    netlink allows non-root users to listen to these notifications.
    
    Fix by adding a new field to the generic netlink multicast group
    structure that when set prevents non-root users or root without the
    'CAP_SYS_ADMIN' capability (in the user namespace owning the network
    namespace) from joining the group. Set this field for the "events"
    group. Use 'CAP_SYS_ADMIN' rather than 'CAP_NET_ADMIN' because of the
    nature of the information that is shared over this group.
    
    Note that the capability check in this case will always be performed
    against the initial user namespace since the family is not netns aware
    and only operates in the initial network namespace.
    
    A new field is added to the structure rather than using the "flags"
    field because the existing field uses uAPI flags and it is inappropriate
    to add a new uAPI flag for an internal kernel check. In net-next we can
    rework the "flags" field to use internal flags and fold the new field
    into it. But for now, in order to reduce the amount of changes, add a
    new field.
    
    Since the information can only be consumed by root, mark the control
    plane operations that start and stop the tracing as root-only using the
    'GENL_ADMIN_PERM' flag.

    psample: Require 'CAP_NET_ADMIN' when joining "packets" group
    
    commit 44ec98ea5ea9cfecd31a5c4cc124703cb5442832 upstream.
    
    The "psample" generic netlink family notifies sampled packets over the

    netlink allows non-root users to listen to these notifications.

    genetlink: add CAP_NET_ADMIN test for multicast bind
    
    This is a partial backport of upstream commit 4d54cc32112d ("mptcp:
    avoid lock_fast usage in accept path"). It is only a partial backport
    because the patch in the link below was erroneously squash-merged into
    upstream commit 4d54cc32112d ("mptcp: avoid lock_fast usage in accept
    path"). Below is the original patch description from Florian Westphal:
    
    "
    genetlink sets NL_CFG_F_NONROOT_RECV for its netlink socket so anyone can
    subscribe to multicast messages.
    
    rtnetlink doesn't allow this unconditionally,  rtnetlink_bind() restricts
    bind requests to CAP_NET_ADMIN for a few groups.
    
    This allows to set GENL_UNS_ADMIN_PERM flag on genl mcast groups to
    mandate CAP_NET_ADMIN.
    
    This will be used by the upcoming mptcp netlink event facility which
    exposes the token (mptcp connection identifier) to userspace.

    netlink: don't call ->netlink_bind with table lock held
    
    From: Florian Westphal <fw@strlen.de>
    
    commit f2764bd4f6a8dffaec3e220728385d9756b3c2cb upstream.
    
    When I added support to allow generic netlink multicast groups to be
    restricted to subscribers with CAP_NET_ADMIN I was unaware that a
    genl_bind implementation already existed in the past.
    
    It was reverted due to ABBA deadlock:
    
    1. ->netlink_bind gets called with the table lock held.
    2. genetlink bind callback is invoked, it grabs the genl lock.
    
    But when a new genl subsystem is (un)registered, these two locks are
    taken in reverse order.
    
    One solution would be to revert again and add a comment in genl
    referring 1e82a62fec613, "genetlink: remove genl_bind").
    
    This would need a second change in mptcp to not expose the raw token
    value anymore, e.g.  by hashing the token with a secret key so userspace
    can still associate subflow events with the correct mptcp connection.
    
    However, Paolo Abeni reminded me to double-check why the netlink table is
    locked in the first place.
    
    I can't find one.  netlink_bind() is already called without this lock
    when userspace joins a group via NETLINK_ADD_MEMBERSHIP setsockopt.
    Same holds for the netlink_unbind operation.
    
    Digging through the history, commit f773608026ee1
    ("netlink: access nlk groups safely in netlink bind and getname")
    expanded the lock scope.
    
    commit 3a20773beeeeade ("net: netlink: cap max groups which will be considered in netlink_bind()")
    ... removed the nlk->ngroups access that the lock scope
    extension was all about.
    
    Reduce the lock scope again and always call ->netlink_bind without
    the table lock.
    
    The Fixes tag should be vs. the patch mentioned in the link below,
    but that one got squash-merged into the patch that came earlier in the
    series.

    nilfs2: fix missing error check for sb_set_blocksize call
    
    commit d61d0ab573649789bf9eb909c89a1a193b2e3d10 upstream.
    
    When mounting a filesystem image with a block size larger than the page
    size, nilfs2 repeatedly outputs long error messages with stack traces to
    the kernel log, such as the following:
    
     getblk(): invalid block size 8192 requested
     logical block size: 512
     ...
     Call Trace:
      dump_stack_lvl+0x92/0xd4
      dump_stack+0xd/0x10
      bdev_getblk+0x33a/0x354
      __breadahead+0x11/0x80
      nilfs_search_super_root+0xe2/0x704 [nilfs2]
      load_nilfs+0x72/0x504 [nilfs2]
      nilfs_mount+0x30f/0x518 [nilfs2]
      legacy_get_tree+0x1b/0x40
      vfs_get_tree+0x18/0xc4
      path_mount+0x786/0xa88
      __ia32_sys_mount+0x147/0x1a8
      __do_fast_syscall_32+0x56/0xc8
      do_fast_syscall_32+0x29/0x58
      do_SYSENTER_32+0x15/0x18
      entry_SYSENTER_32+0x98/0xf1
     ...
    
    This overloads the system logger.  And to make matters worse, it sometimes
    crashes the kernel with a memory access violation.
    
    This is because the return value of the sb_set_blocksize() call, which
    should be checked for errors, is not checked.
    
    The latter issue is due to out-of-buffer memory being accessed based on a
    large block size that caused sb_set_blocksize() to fail for buffers read
    with the initial minimum block size that remained unupdated in the
    super_block structure.
    
    Since nilfs2 mkfs tool does not accept block sizes larger than the system
    page size, this has been overlooked.  However, it is possible to create
    this situation by intentionally modifying the tool or by passing a
    filesystem image created on a system with a large page size to a system
    with a smaller page size and mounting it.
    
    Fix this issue by inserting the expected error handling for the call to
    sb_set_blocksize().

    serial: sc16is7xx: address RX timeout interrupt errata
    
    commit 08ce9a1b72e38cf44c300a44ac5858533eb3c860 upstream.
    
    This device has a silicon bug that makes it report a timeout interrupt
    but no data in the FIFO.
    
    The datasheet states the following in the errata section 18.1.4:
    
      "If the host reads the receive FIFO at the same time as a
      time-out interrupt condition happens, the host might read 0xCC
      (time-out) in the Interrupt Indication Register (IIR), but bit 0
      of the Line Status Register (LSR) is not set (means there is no
      data in the receive FIFO)."
    
    The errata description seems to indicate it concerns only polled mode of
    operation when reading bit 0 of the LSR register. However, tests have
    shown and NXP has confirmed that the RXLVL register also yields 0 when
    the bug is triggered, and hence the IRQ driven implementation in this
    driver is equally affected.
    
    This bug has hit us on production units and when it does, sc16is7xx_irq()
    would spin forever because sc16is7xx_port_irq() keeps seeing an
    interrupt in the IIR register that is not cleared because the driver
    does not call into sc16is7xx_handle_rx() unless the RXLVL register
    reports at least one byte in the FIFO.
    
    Fix this by always reading one byte from the FIFO when this condition
    is detected in order to clear the interrupt. This approach was
    confirmed to be correct by NXP through their support channels.

    packet: Move reference count in packet_sock to atomic_long_t
    
    commit db3fadacaf0c817b222090290d06ca2a338422d0 upstream.
    
    In some potential instances the reference count on struct packet_sock
    could be saturated and cause overflows which gets the kernel a bit
    confused. To prevent this, move to a 64-bit atomic reference count on
    64-bit architectures to prevent the possibility of this type to overflow.
    
    Because we can not handle saturation, using refcount_t is not possible
    in this place. Maybe someday in the future if it changes it could be
    used. Also, instead of using plain atomic64_t, use atomic_long_t instead.
    32-bit machines tend to be memory-limited (i.e. anything that increases
    a reference uses so much memory that you can't actually get to 2**32
    references). 32-bit architectures also tend to have serious problems
    with 64-bit atomics. Hence, atomic_long_t is the more natural solution.

    tracing: Fix a possible race when disabling buffered events
    
    commit c0591b1cccf708a47bc465c62436d669a4213323 upstream.
    
    Function trace_buffered_event_disable() is responsible for freeing pages
    backing buffered events and this process can run concurrently with
    trace_event_buffer_lock_reserve().
    
    The following race is currently possible:
    
    * Function trace_buffered_event_disable() is called on CPU 0. It
      increments trace_buffered_event_cnt on each CPU and waits via
      synchronize_rcu() for each user of trace_buffered_event to complete.
    
    * After synchronize_rcu() is finished, function
      trace_buffered_event_disable() has the exclusive access to
      trace_buffered_event. All counters trace_buffered_event_cnt are at 1
      and all pointers trace_buffered_event are still valid.
    
    * At this point, on a different CPU 1, the execution reaches
      trace_event_buffer_lock_reserve(). The function calls
      preempt_disable_notrace() and only now enters an RCU read-side
      critical section. The function proceeds and reads a still valid
      pointer from trace_buffered_event[CPU1] into the local variable
      "entry". However, it doesn't yet read trace_buffered_event_cnt[CPU1]
      which happens later.
    
    * Function trace_buffered_event_disable() continues. It frees
      trace_buffered_event[CPU1] and decrements
      trace_buffered_event_cnt[CPU1] back to 0.
    
    * Function trace_event_buffer_lock_reserve() continues. It reads and
      increments trace_buffered_event_cnt[CPU1] from 0 to 1. This makes it
      believe that it can use the "entry" that it already obtained but the
      pointer is now invalid and any access results in a use-after-free.
    
    Fix the problem by making a second synchronize_rcu() call after all
    trace_buffered_event values are set to NULL. This waits on all potential
    users in trace_event_buffer_lock_reserve() that still read a previous
    pointer from trace_buffered_event.

    For instance, it can be triggered by running these two commands in
    parallel:
    
     $ while true; do
        echo hist:key=id.syscall:val=hitcount > \
          /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/raw_syscalls/sys_enter/trigger;
      done
     $ stress-ng --sysinfo $(nproc)
    
    The warning indicates that the current ring_buffer_per_cpu is not in the
    committing state. It happens because the active ring_buffer_event
    doesn't actually come from the ring_buffer_per_cpu but is allocated from
    trace_buffered_event.
    
    The bug is in function trace_buffered_event_disable() where the
    following normally happens:
    
    * The code invokes disable_trace_buffered_event() via
      smp_call_function_many() and follows it by synchronize_rcu(). This
      increments the per-CPU variable trace_buffered_event_cnt on each
      target CPU and grants trace_buffered_event_disable() the exclusive
      access to the per-CPU variable trace_buffered_event.
    
    * Maintenance is performed on trace_buffered_event, all per-CPU event
      buffers get freed.
    
    * The code invokes enable_trace_buffered_event() via
      smp_call_function_many(). This decrements trace_buffered_event_cnt and
      releases the access to trace_buffered_event.
    
    A problem is that smp_call_function_many() runs a given function on all
    target CPUs except on the current one. The following can then occur:
    
    * Task X executing trace_buffered_event_disable() runs on CPU 0.
    
    * The control reaches synchronize_rcu() and the task gets rescheduled on
      another CPU 1.
    
    * The RCU synchronization finishes. At this point,
      trace_buffered_event_disable() has the exclusive access to all
      trace_buffered_event variables except trace_buffered_event[CPU0]
      because trace_buffered_event_cnt[CPU0] is never incremented and if the
      buffer is currently unused, remains set to 0.
    
    * A different task Y is scheduled on CPU 0 and hits a trace event. The
      code in trace_event_buffer_lock_reserve() sees that
      trace_buffered_event_cnt[CPU0] is set to 0 and decides the use the
      buffer provided by trace_buffered_event[CPU0].
    
    * Task X continues its execution in trace_buffered_event_disable(). The
      code incorrectly frees the event buffer pointed by
      trace_buffered_event[CPU0] and resets the variable to NULL.
    
    * Task Y writes event data to the now freed buffer and later detects the
      created inconsistency.
    
    The issue is observable since commit dea499781a11 ("tracing: Fix warning
    in trace_buffered_event_disable()") which moved the call of
    trace_buffered_event_disable() in __ftrace_event_enable_disable()
    earlier, prior to invoking call->class->reg(.. TRACE_REG_UNREGISTER ..).
    The underlying problem in trace_buffered_event_disable() is however
    present since the original implementation in commit 0fc1b09ff1ff
    ("tracing: Use temp buffer when filtering events").
    
    Fix the problem by replacing the two smp_call_function_many() calls with
    on_each_cpu_mask() which invokes a given callback on all CPUs.

    tracing: Always update snapshot buffer size
    
    commit 7be76461f302ec05cbd62b90b2a05c64299ca01f upstream.
    
    It use to be that only the top level instance had a snapshot buffer (for
    latency tracers like wakeup and irqsoff). The update of the ring buffer
    size would check if the instance was the top level and if so, it would
    also update the snapshot buffer as it needs to be the same as the main
    buffer.
    
    Now that lower level instances also has a snapshot buffer, they too need
    to update their snapshot buffer sizes when the main buffer is changed,
    otherwise the following can be triggered:
    
     # cd /sys/kernel/tracing
     # echo 1500 > buffer_size_kb
     # mkdir instances/foo
     # echo irqsoff > instances/foo/current_tracer
     # echo 1000 > instances/foo/buffer_size_kb
    
    Produces:
    
     WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 856 at kernel/trace/trace.c:1938 update_max_tr_single.part.0+0x27d/0x320

            }
    
            WARN_ON_ONCE(ret && ret != -EAGAIN && ret != -EBUSY);  <== here
    
    That's because ring_buffer_swap_cpu() has:
    
            int ret = -EINVAL;
    
            [..]
    
            /* At least make sure the two buffers are somewhat the same */
            if (cpu_buffer_a->nr_pages != cpu_buffer_b->nr_pages)

            [..]
     out:

     }
    
    Instead, update all instances' snapshot buffer sizes when their main
    buffer size is updated.

    nilfs2: prevent WARNING in nilfs_sufile_set_segment_usage()
    
    commit 675abf8df1353e0e3bde314993e0796c524cfbf0 upstream.
    
    If nilfs2 reads a disk image with corrupted segment usage metadata, and
    its segment usage information is marked as an error for the segment at the
    write location, nilfs_sufile_set_segment_usage() can trigger WARN_ONs
    during log writing.
    
    Segments newly allocated for writing with nilfs_sufile_alloc() will not
    have this error flag set, but this unexpected situation will occur if the
    segment indexed by either nilfs->ns_segnum or nilfs->ns_nextnum (active
    segment) was marked in error.
    
    Fix this issue by inserting a sanity check to treat it as a file system
    corruption.
    
    Since error returns are not allowed during the execution phase where
    nilfs_sufile_set_segment_usage() is used, this inserts the sanity check
    into nilfs_sufile_mark_dirty() which pre-reads the buffer containing the
    segment usage record to be updated and sets it up in a dirty state for
    writing.
    
    In addition, nilfs_sufile_set_segment_usage() is also called when
    canceling log writing and undoing segment usage update, so in order to
    avoid issuing the same kernel warning in that case, in case of
    cancellation, avoid checking the error flag in
    nilfs_sufile_set_segment_usage().

    tracing: Fix a warning when allocating buffered events fails
    
    [ Upstream commit 34209fe83ef8404353f91ab4ea4035dbc9922d04 ]
    
    Function trace_buffered_event_disable() produces an unexpected warning
    when the previous call to trace_buffered_event_enable() fails to
    allocate pages for buffered events.
    
    The situation can occur as follows:
    
    * The counter trace_buffered_event_ref is at 0.
    
    * The soft mode gets enabled for some event and
      trace_buffered_event_enable() is called. The function increments
      trace_buffered_event_ref to 1 and starts allocating event pages.
    
    * The allocation fails for some page and trace_buffered_event_disable()
      is called for cleanup.
    
    * Function trace_buffered_event_disable() decrements
      trace_buffered_event_ref back to 0, recognizes that it was the last
      use of buffered events and frees all allocated pages.
    
    * The control goes back to trace_buffered_event_enable() which returns.
      The caller of trace_buffered_event_enable() has no information that
      the function actually failed.
    
    * Some time later, the soft mode is disabled for the same event.
      Function trace_buffered_event_disable() is called. It warns on
      "WARN_ON_ONCE(!trace_buffered_event_ref)" and returns.
    
    Buffered events are just an optimization and can handle failures. Make
    trace_buffered_event_enable() exit on the first failure and left any
    cleanup later to when trace_buffered_event_disable() is called.

    hwmon: (acpi_power_meter) Fix 4.29 MW bug
    
    [ Upstream commit 1fefca6c57fb928d2131ff365270cbf863d89c88 ]
    
    The ACPI specification says:
    
    "If an error occurs while obtaining the meter reading or if the value
    is not available then an Integer with all bits set is returned"
    
    Since the "integer" is 32 bits in case of the ACPI power meter,
    userspace will get a power reading of 2^32 * 1000 miliwatts (~4.29 MW)
    in case of such an error. This was discovered due to a lm_sensors
    bugreport (https://github.com/lm-sensors/lm-sensors/issues/460).
    Fix this by returning -ENODATA instead.

    tcp: do not accept ACK of bytes we never sent
    
    [ Upstream commit 3d501dd326fb1c73f1b8206d4c6e1d7b15c07e27 ]
    
    This patch is based on a detailed report and ideas from Yepeng Pan
    and Christian Rossow.
    
    ACK seq validation is currently following RFC 5961 5.2 guidelines:
    
       The ACK value is considered acceptable only if
       it is in the range of ((SND.UNA - MAX.SND.WND) <= SEG.ACK <=
       SND.NXT).  All incoming segments whose ACK value doesn't satisfy the
       above condition MUST be discarded and an ACK sent back.  It needs to
       be noted that RFC 793 on page 72 (fifth check) says: "If the ACK is a
       duplicate (SEG.ACK < SND.UNA), it can be ignored.  If the ACK
       acknowledges something not yet sent (SEG.ACK > SND.NXT) then send an
       ACK, drop the segment, and return".  The "ignored" above implies that
       the processing of the incoming data segment continues, which means
       the ACK value is treated as acceptable.  This mitigation makes the
       ACK check more stringent since any ACK < SND.UNA wouldn't be
       accepted, instead only ACKs that are in the range ((SND.UNA -
       MAX.SND.WND) <= SEG.ACK <= SND.NXT) get through.
    
    This can be refined for new (and possibly spoofed) flows,
    by not accepting ACK for bytes that were never sent.
    
    This greatly improves TCP security at a little cost.
    
    I added a Fixes: tag to make sure this patch will reach stable trees,
    even if the 'blamed' patch was adhering to the RFC.
    
    tp->bytes_acked was added in linux-4.2
    
    Following packetdrill test (courtesy of Yepeng Pan) shows
    the issue at hand:
    
    0 socket(..., SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP) = 3
    +0 setsockopt(3, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, [1], 4) = 0
    +0 bind(3, ..., ...) = 0
    +0 listen(3, 1024) = 0
    
    // ---------------- Handshake ------------------- //
    
    // when window scale is set to 14 the window size can be extended to
    // 65535 * (2^14) = 1073725440. Linux would accept an ACK packet
    // with ack number in (Server_ISN+1-1073725440. Server_ISN+1)
    // ,though this ack number acknowledges some data never

    +0 accept(3, ..., ...) = 4
    
    // For the established connection, we send an ACK packet,
    // the ack packet uses ack number 1 - 1073725300 + 2^32,
    // where 2^32 is used to wrap around.
    // Note: we used 1073725300 instead of 1073725440 to avoid possible
