    remoteproc: stm32: fix incorrect optional pointers
    
    commit fb2bdd32b231b70e6a3f1054528692f604db25d8 upstream.
    
    Compile-testing without CONFIG_OF shows that the of_match_ptr() macro
    was used incorrectly here:
    
    drivers/remoteproc/stm32_rproc.c:662:34: warning: unused variable 'stm32_rproc_match' [-Wunused-const-variable]
    
    As in almost every driver, the solution is simply to remove the
    use of this macro. The same thing happened with the deprecated
    SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS(), but the corresponding warning was already shut
    up with __maybe_unused annotations, so fix those as well by using the
    correct DEFINE_SIMPLE_DEV_PM_OPS() macros and removing the extraneous
    __maybe_unused modifiers. For completeness, also add a pm_ptr() to let
    the PM ops be eliminated completely when CONFIG_PM is turned off.

    x86/efistub: Don't clear BSS twice in mixed mode
    
    [ Upstream commit df7ecce842b846a04d087ba85fdb79a90e26a1b0 ]
    
    Clearing BSS should only be done once, at the very beginning.
    efi_pe_entry() is the entrypoint from the firmware, which may not clear
    BSS and so it is done explicitly. However, efi_pe_entry() is also used
    as an entrypoint by the mixed mode startup code, in which case BSS will
    already have been cleared, and doing it again at this point will corrupt
    global variables holding the firmware's GDT/IDT and segment selectors.
    
    So make the memset() conditional on whether the EFI stub is running in
    native mode.

    x86/efistub: Clear decompressor BSS in native EFI entrypoint
    
    [ Upstream commit b3810c5a2cc4a6665f7a65bed5393c75ce3f3aa2 ]
    
    The EFI stub on x86 no longer invokes the decompressor as a subsequent
    boot stage, but calls into the decompression code directly while running
    in the context of the EFI boot services.
    
    This means that when using the native EFI entrypoint (as opposed to the
    EFI handover protocol, which clears BSS explicitly), the firmware PE
    image loader is being relied upon to ensure that BSS is zeroed before
    the EFI stub is entered from the firmware.
    
    As Radek's report proves, this is a bad idea. Not all loaders do this
    correctly, which means some global variables that should be statically
    initialized to 0x0 may have junk in them.
    
    So clear BSS explicitly when entering via efi_pe_entry(). Note that
    zeroing BSS from C code is not generally safe, but in this case, the
    following assignment and dereference of a global pointer variable
    ensures that the memset() cannot be deferred or reordered.

    dm-integrity: align the outgoing bio in integrity_recheck
    
    [ Upstream commit b4d78cfeb30476239cf08f4f40afc095c173d6e3 ]
    
    It is possible to set up dm-integrity with smaller sector size than
    the logical sector size of the underlying device. In this situation,
    dm-integrity guarantees that the outgoing bios have the same alignment as
    incoming bios (so, if you create a filesystem with 4k block size,
    dm-integrity would send 4k-aligned bios to the underlying device).
    
    This guarantee was broken when integrity_recheck was implemented.
    integrity_recheck sends bio that is aligned to ic->sectors_per_block. So
    if we set up integrity with 512-byte sector size on a device with logical
    block size 4k, we would be sending unaligned bio. This triggered a bug in
    one of our internal tests.
    
    This commit fixes it by determining the actual alignment of the
    incoming bio and then makes sure that the outgoing bio in
    integrity_recheck has the same alignment.

    The tests send 100 pings in 0.1 second intervals and force a timeout of
    11 seconds, which is borderline (especially on debug kernels), resulting
    in random failures in netdev CI [1].
    
    Fix by increasing the timeout to 20 seconds. It should not prolong the

    net: dsa: mt7530: fix handling of all link-local frames
    
    [ Upstream commit 69ddba9d170bdaee1dc0eb4ced38d7e4bb7b92af ]
    
    Currently, the MT753X switches treat frames with :01-0D and :0F MAC DAs as
    regular multicast frames, therefore flooding them to user ports.
    
    On page 205, section "8.6.3 Frame filtering" of the active standard, IEEE
    Std 802.1Q™-2022, it is stated that frames with 01:80:C2:00:00:00-0F as MAC
    DA must only be propagated to C-VLAN and MAC Bridge components. That means
    VLAN-aware and VLAN-unaware bridges. On the switch designs with CPU ports,
    these frames are supposed to be processed by the CPU (software). So we make
    the switch only forward them to the CPU port. And if received from a CPU
    port, forward to a single port. The software is responsible of making the
    switch conform to the latter by setting a single port as destination port
    on the special tag.
    
    This switch intellectual property cannot conform to this part of the
    standard fully. Whilst the REV_UN frame tag covers the remaining :04-0D and
    :0F MAC DAs, it also includes :22-FF which the scope of propagation is not
    supposed to be restricted for these MAC DAs.
    
    Set frames with :01-03 MAC DAs to be trapped to the CPU port(s). Add a
    comment for the remaining MAC DAs.
    
    Note that the ingress port must have a PVID assigned to it for the switch
    to forward untagged frames. A PVID is set by default on VLAN-aware and
    VLAN-unaware ports. However, when the network interface that pertains to
    the ingress port is attached to a vlan_filtering enabled bridge, the user
    can remove the PVID assignment from it which would prevent the link-local
    frames from being trapped to the CPU port. I am yet to see a way to forward
    link-local frames while preventing other untagged frames from being
    forwarded too.

    net: dsa: mt7530: fix link-local frames that ingress vlan filtering ports
    
    [ Upstream commit e8bf353577f382c7066c661fed41b2adc0fc7c40 ]
    
    Whether VLAN-aware or not, on every VID VLAN table entry that has the CPU
    port as a member of it, frames are set to egress the CPU port with the VLAN
    tag stacked. This is so that VLAN tags can be appended after hardware
    special tag (called DSA tag in the context of Linux drivers).
    
    For user ports on a VLAN-unaware bridge, frame ingressing the user port
    egresses CPU port with only the special tag.
    
    For user ports on a VLAN-aware bridge, frame ingressing the user port
    egresses CPU port with the special tag and the VLAN tag.
    
    This causes issues with link-local frames, specifically BPDUs, because the
    software expects to receive them VLAN-untagged.
    
    There are two options to make link-local frames egress untagged. Setting
    CONSISTENT or UNTAGGED on the EG_TAG bits on the relevant register.
    CONSISTENT means frames egress exactly as they ingress. That means
    egressing with the VLAN tag they had at ingress or egressing untagged if
    they ingressed untagged. Although link-local frames are not supposed to be
    transmitted VLAN-tagged, if they are done so, when egressing through a CPU
    port, the special tag field will be broken.

    To prevent confusing the software, force the frame to egress UNTAGGED
    instead of CONSISTENT. This way, frames can't possibly be received TAGGED
    by software which would have the special tag field broken.
    
    VLAN Tag Egress Procedure
    
       For all frames, one of these options set the earliest in this order will
       apply to the frame:
    
       - EG_TAG in certain registers for certain frames.
         This will apply to frame with matching MAC DA or EtherType.
    
       - EG_TAG in the address table.
         This will apply to frame at its incoming port.
    
       - EG_TAG in the PVC register.
         This will apply to frame at its incoming port.
    
       - EG_CON and [EG_TAG per port] in the VLAN table.
         This will apply to frame at its outgoing port.
    
       - EG_TAG in the PCR register.
         This will apply to frame at its outgoing port.
    
       EG_TAG in certain registers for certain frames:
    
       PPPoE Discovery_ARP/RARP: PPP_EG_TAG and ARP_EG_TAG in the APC register.
       IGMP_MLD: IGMP_EG_TAG and MLD_EG_TAG in the IMC register.
       BPDU and PAE: BPDU_EG_TAG and PAE_EG_TAG in the BPC register.
       REV_01 and REV_02: R01_EG_TAG and R02_EG_TAG in the RGAC1 register.
       REV_03 and REV_0E: R03_EG_TAG and R0E_EG_TAG in the RGAC2 register.
       REV_10 and REV_20: R10_EG_TAG and R20_EG_TAG in the RGAC3 register.
       REV_21 and REV_UN: R21_EG_TAG and RUN_EG_TAG in the RGAC4 register.
    
    With this change, it can be observed that a bridge interface with stp_state
    and vlan_filtering enabled will properly block ports now.

    net: report RCU QS on threaded NAPI repolling
    
    [ Upstream commit d6dbbb11247c71203785a2c9da474c36f4b19eae ]
    
    NAPI threads can keep polling packets under load. Currently it is only
    calling cond_resched() before repolling, but it is not sufficient to
    clear out the holdout of RCU tasks, which prevent BPF tracing programs
    from detaching for long period. This can be reproduced easily with
    following set up:
    
    ip netns add test1
    ip netns add test2
    
    ip -n test1 link add veth1 type veth peer name veth2 netns test2
    
    ip -n test1 link set veth1 up
    ip -n test1 link set lo up
    ip -n test2 link set veth2 up
    ip -n test2 link set lo up
    
    ip -n test1 addr add 192.168.1.2/31 dev veth1
    ip -n test1 addr add 1.1.1.1/32 dev lo
    ip -n test2 addr add 192.168.1.3/31 dev veth2
    ip -n test2 addr add 2.2.2.2/31 dev lo
    
    ip -n test1 route add default via 192.168.1.3
    ip -n test2 route add default via 192.168.1.2
    
    for i in `seq 10 210`; do
     for j in `seq 10 210`; do
        ip netns exec test2 iptables -I INPUT -s 3.3.$i.$j -p udp --dport 5201
     done
    done
    
    ip netns exec test2 ethtool -K veth2 gro on
    ip netns exec test2 bash -c 'echo 1 > /sys/class/net/veth2/threaded'
    ip netns exec test1 ethtool -K veth1 tso off
    
    Then run an iperf3 client/server and a bpftrace script can trigger it:
    
    ip netns exec test2 iperf3 -s -B 2.2.2.2 >/dev/null&
    ip netns exec test1 iperf3 -c 2.2.2.2 -B 1.1.1.1 -u -l 1500 -b 3g -t 100 >/dev/null&
    bpftrace -e 'kfunc:__napi_poll{@=count();} interval:s:1{exit();}'
    
    Report RCU quiescent states periodically will resolve the issue.

    rcu: add a helper to report consolidated flavor QS
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a77557d48cff187a169c2aec01c0dd78a5e7e50 ]
    
    When under heavy load, network processing can run CPU-bound for many
    tens of seconds. Even in preemptible kernels (non-RT kernel), this can
    block RCU Tasks grace periods, which can cause trace-event removal to
    take more than a minute, which is unacceptably long.
    
    This commit therefore creates a new helper function that passes through
    both RCU and RCU-Tasks quiescent states every 100 milliseconds. This
    hard-coded value suffices for current workloads.

    net: octeontx2: Use alloc_ordered_workqueue() to create ordered workqueues
    
    [ Upstream commit 289f97467480266f9bd8cac7f1e05a478d523f79 ]
    
    BACKGROUND
    ==========
    
    When multiple work items are queued to a workqueue, their execution order
    doesn't match the queueing order. They may get executed in any order and
    simultaneously. When fully serialized execution - one by one in the queueing
    order - is needed, an ordered workqueue should be used which can be created
    with alloc_ordered_workqueue().
    
    However, alloc_ordered_workqueue() was a later addition. Before it, an
    ordered workqueue could be obtained by creating an UNBOUND workqueue with
    @max_active==1. This originally was an implementation side-effect which was
    broken by 4c16bd327c74 ("workqueue: restore WQ_UNBOUND/max_active==1 to be
    ordered"). Because there were users that depended on the ordered execution,
    5c0338c68706 ("workqueue: restore WQ_UNBOUND/max_active==1 to be ordered")
    made workqueue allocation path to implicitly promote UNBOUND workqueues w/
    @max_active==1 to ordered workqueues.
    
    While this has worked okay, overloading the UNBOUND allocation interface
    this way creates other issues. It's difficult to tell whether a given
    workqueue actually needs to be ordered and users that legitimately want a
    min concurrency level wq unexpectedly gets an ordered one instead. With
    planned UNBOUND workqueue updates to improve execution locality and more
    prevalence of chiplet designs which can benefit from such improvements, this
    isn't a state we wanna be in forever.
    
    This patch series audits all callsites that create an UNBOUND workqueue w/
    @max_active==1 and converts them to alloc_ordered_workqueue() as necessary.
    
    WHAT TO LOOK FOR
    ================
    
    The conversions are from
    
      alloc_workqueue(WQ_UNBOUND | flags, 1, args..)
    
    to
    
      alloc_ordered_workqueue(flags, args...)
    
    which don't cause any functional changes. If you know that fully ordered
    execution is not ncessary, please let me know. I'll drop the conversion and
    instead add a comment noting the fact to reduce confusion while conversion
    is in progress.
    
    If you aren't fully sure, it's completely fine to let the conversion
    through. The behavior will stay exactly the same and we can always
    reconsider later.
    
    As there are follow-up workqueue core changes, I'd really appreciate if the
    patch can be routed through the workqueue tree w/ your acks. Thanks.

    octeontx2: Detect the mbox up or down message via register
    
    [ Upstream commit a88e0f936ba9a301c78f6eacfd38737d003c130b ]
    
    A single line of interrupt is used to receive up notifications
    and down reply messages from AF to PF (similarly from PF to its VF).
    PF acts as bridge and forwards VF messages to AF and sends respsones
    back from AF to VF. When an async event like link event is received
    by up message when PF is in middle of forwarding VF message then
    mailbox errors occur because PF state machine is corrupted.
    Since VF is a separate driver or VF driver can be in a VM it is
    not possible to serialize from the start of communication at VF.
    Hence to differentiate between type of messages at PF this patch makes
    sender to set mbox data register with distinct values for up and down
    messages. Sender also checks whether previous interrupt is received
    before triggering current interrupt by waiting for mailbox data register
    to become zero.

    net/bnx2x: Prevent access to a freed page in page_pool
    
    [ Upstream commit d27e2da94a42655861ca4baea30c8cd65546f25d ]
    
    Fix race condition leading to system crash during EEH error handling
    
    During EEH error recovery, the bnx2x driver's transmit timeout logic
    could cause a race condition when handling reset tasks. The
    bnx2x_tx_timeout() schedules reset tasks via bnx2x_sp_rtnl_task(),
    which ultimately leads to bnx2x_nic_unload(). In bnx2x_nic_unload()
    SGEs are freed using bnx2x_free_rx_sge_range(). However, this could
    overlap with the EEH driver's attempt to reset the device using
    bnx2x_io_slot_reset(), which also tries to free SGEs. This race
    condition can result in system crashes due to accessing freed memory
    locations in bnx2x_free_rx_sge()
    
    799  static inline void bnx2x_free_rx_sge(struct bnx2x *bp,

    dm-integrity: fix a memory leak when rechecking the data
    
    [ Upstream commit 55e565c42dce81a4e49c13262d5bc4eb4c2e588a ]
    
    Memory for the "checksums" pointer will leak if the data is rechecked
    after checksum failure (because the associated kfree won't happen due
    to 'goto skip_io').
    
    Fix this by freeing the checksums memory before recheck, and just use
    the "checksum_onstack" memory for storing checksum during recheck.

    net: phy: fix phy_read_poll_timeout argument type in genphy_loopback
    
    [ Upstream commit 32fa4366cc4da1c97b725a0066adf43c6b298f37 ]
    
    read_poll_timeout inside phy_read_poll_timeout can set val negative
    in some cases (for example, __mdiobus_read inside phy_read can return
    -EOPNOTSUPP).
    
    Supposedly, commit 4ec732951702 ("net: phylib: fix phy_read*_poll_timeout()")
    should fix problems with wrong-signed vals, but I do not see how
    as val is sent to phy_read as is and __val = phy_read (not val)
    is checked for sign.
    
    Change val type for signed to allow better error handling as done in other
    phy_read_poll_timeout callers. This will not fix any error handling
    by itself, but allows, for example, to modify cond with appropriate
    sign check or check resulting val separately.

    ipv4: raw: Fix sending packets from raw sockets via IPsec tunnels
    
    [ Upstream commit c9b3b81716c5b92132a6c1d4ac3c48a7b44082ab ]
    
    Since the referenced commit, the xfrm_inner_extract_output() function
    uses the protocol field to determine the address family.  So not setting
    it for IPv4 raw sockets meant that such packets couldn't be tunneled via
    IPsec anymore.

    rds: introduce acquire/release ordering in acquire/release_in_xmit()

    acquire/release_in_xmit() work as bit lock in rds_send_xmit(), so they
    are expected to ensure acquire/release memory ordering semantics.
    However, test_and_set_bit/clear_bit() don't imply such semantics, on
    top of this, following smp_mb__after_atomic() does not guarantee release
    ordering (memory barrier actually should be placed before clear_bit()).
    
    Instead, we use clear_bit_unlock/test_and_set_bit_lock() here.

    vdpa/mlx5: Allow CVQ size changes
    
    [ Upstream commit 749a4016839270163efc36ecddddd01de491a16b ]
    
    The MLX driver was not updating its control virtqueue size at set_vq_num
    and instead always initialized to MLX5_CVQ_MAX_ENT (16) at
    setup_cvq_vring.
    
    Qemu would try to set the size to 64 by default, however, because the
    CVQ size always was initialized to 16, an error would be thrown when
    sending >16 control messages (as used-ring entry 17 is initialized to 0).
    For example, starting a guest with x-svq=on and then executing the
    following command would produce the error below:
    
     # for i in {1..20}; do ifconfig eth0 hw ether XX:xx:XX:xx:XX:XX; done

    net: dsa: mt7530: prevent possible incorrect XTAL frequency selection
    
    [ Upstream commit f490c492e946d8ffbe65ad4efc66de3c5ede30a4 ]
    
    On MT7530, the HT_XTAL_FSEL field of the HWTRAP register stores a 2-bit
    value that represents the frequency of the crystal oscillator connected to
    the switch IC. The field is populated by the state of the ESW_P4_LED_0 and
    ESW_P4_LED_0 pins, which is done right after reset is deasserted.
    
      ESW_P4_LED_0    ESW_P3_LED_0    Frequency
      -----------------------------------------
      0               0               Reserved
      0               1               20MHz
      1               0               40MHz
      1               1               25MHz
    
    On MT7531, the XTAL25 bit of the STRAP register stores this. The LAN0LED0
    pin is used to populate the bit. 25MHz when the pin is high, 40MHz when
    it's low.
    
    These pins are also used with LEDs, therefore, their state can be set to
    something other than the bootstrapping configuration. For example, a link
    may be established on port 3 before the DSA subdriver takes control of the
    switch which would set ESW_P3_LED_0 to high.
    
    Currently on mt7530_setup() and mt7531_setup(), 1000 - 1100 usec delay is
    described between reset assertion and deassertion. Some switch ICs in real
    life conditions cannot always have these pins set back to the bootstrapping
    configuration before reset deassertion in this amount of delay. This causes
    wrong crystal frequency to be selected which puts the switch in a
    nonfunctional state after reset deassertion.
    
    The tests below are conducted on an MT7530 with a 40MHz crystal oscillator
    by Justin Swartz.
    
    With a cable from an active peer connected to port 3 before reset, an
    incorrect crystal frequency (0b11 = 25MHz) is selected:

    Increase the delay between reset_control_assert() and

    gpiod_set_value_cansleep(priv->reset, 1) to 5000 - 5100 usec. This amount
    ensures a higher possibility that the switch IC will have these pins back
    to the bootstrapping configuration before reset deassertion.

    net: veth: do not manipulate GRO when using XDP
    
    [ Upstream commit d7db7775ea2e31502d46427f5efd385afc4ff1eb ]
    
    Commit d3256efd8e8b ("veth: allow enabling NAPI even without XDP") tried to fix
    the fact that GRO was not possible without XDP, because veth did not use NAPI
    without XDP. However, it also introduced the behaviour that GRO is always
    enabled, when XDP is enabled.
    
    While it might be desired for most cases, it is confusing for the user at best
    as the GRO flag suddenly changes, when an XDP program is attached. It also
    introduces some complexities in state management as was partially addressed in
    commit fe9f801355f0 ("net: veth: clear GRO when clearing XDP even when down").
    
    But the biggest problem is that it is not possible to disable GRO at all, when
    an XDP program is attached, which might be needed for some use cases.
    
    Fix this by not touching the GRO flag on XDP enable/disable as the code already
    supports switching to NAPI if either GRO or XDP is requested.

    [ Upstream commit ea80e3ed09ab2c2b75724faf5484721753e92c31 ]
    
    A patch to resolve an issue was found in MediaTek's GPL-licensed SDK:
    In the mtk_ppe_stop() function, the PPE scan mode is not disabled before
    disabling the PPE. This can potentially lead to a hang during the process
    of disabling the PPE.
    
    Without this patch, the PPE may experience a hang during the reboot test.

    nvme: fix reconnection fail due to reserved tag allocation
    
    [ Upstream commit de105068fead55ed5c07ade75e9c8e7f86a00d1d ]
    
    We found a issue on production environment while using NVMe over RDMA,
    admin_q reconnect failed forever while remote target and network is ok.
    After dig into it, we found it may caused by a ABBA deadlock due to tag
    allocation. In my case, the tag was hold by a keep alive request
    waiting inside admin_q, as we quiesced admin_q while reset ctrl, so the
    request maked as idle and will not process before reset success. As
    fabric_q shares tagset with admin_q, while reconnect remote target, we
    need a tag for connect command, but the only one reserved tag was held
    by keep alive command which waiting inside admin_q. As a result, we
    failed to reconnect admin_q forever. In order to fix this issue, I
    think we should keep two reserved tags for admin queue.

    If the packet type ID field in the Ethernet header is either ETH_P_PRP or
    ETH_P_HSR, but it is not followed by an HSR tag, hsr_get_skb_sequence_nr()
    reads an invalid value as a sequence number. This causes the above issue.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by returning NULL if the Ethernet header is not
    followed by an HSR tag.

    tcp: Fix refcnt handling in __inet_hash_connect().
    
    [ Upstream commit 04d9d1fc428ac9f581d55118d67e0cb546701feb ]
    
    syzbot reported a warning in sk_nulls_del_node_init_rcu().
    
    The commit 66b60b0c8c4a ("dccp/tcp: Unhash sk from ehash for tb2 alloc
    failure after check_estalblished().") tried to fix an issue that an
    unconnected socket occupies an ehash entry when bhash2 allocation fails.
    
    In such a case, we need to revert changes done by check_established(),
    which does not hold refcnt when inserting socket into ehash.
    
    So, to revert the change, we need to __sk_nulls_add_node_rcu() instead
    of sk_nulls_add_node_rcu().
    
    Otherwise, sock_put() will cause refcnt underflow and leak the socket.

    soc: fsl: dpio: fix kcalloc() argument order
    
    [ Upstream commit 72ebb41b88f9d7c10c5e159e0507074af0a22fe2 ]
    
    A previous bugfix added a call to kcalloc(), which starting in gcc-14
    causes a harmless warning about the argument order:
    
    drivers/soc/fsl/dpio/dpio-service.c: In function 'dpaa2_io_service_enqueue_multiple_desc_fq':
    drivers/soc/fsl/dpio/dpio-service.c:526:29: error: 'kcalloc' sizes specified with 'sizeof' in the earlier argument and not in the later argument [-Werror=calloc-transposed-args]
      526 |         ed = kcalloc(sizeof(struct qbman_eq_desc), 32, GFP_KERNEL);
          |                             ^~~~~~
    drivers/soc/fsl/dpio/dpio-service.c:526:29: note: earlier argument should specify number of elements, later size of each element
    
    Since the two are only multiplied, the order does not change the
    behavior, so just fix it now to shut up the compiler warning.
    
    Dmity independently came up with the same fix.

    s390/vtime: fix average steal time calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit 367c50f78451d3bd7ad70bc5c89f9ba6dec46ca9 ]
    
    Current average steal timer calculation produces volatile and inflated
    values. The only user of this value is KVM so far and it uses that to
    decide whether or not to yield the vCPU which is seeing steal time.
    KVM compares average steal timer to a threshold and if the threshold
    is past then it does not allow CPU polling and yields it to host, else
    it keeps the CPU by polling.
    Since KVM's steal time threshold is very low by default (%10) it most
    likely is not effected much by the bloated average steal timer values
    because the operating region is pretty small. However there might be
    new users in the future who might rely on this number. Fix average
    steal timer calculation by changing the formula from:
    
            avg_steal_timer = avg_steal_timer / 2 + steal_timer;
    
    to the following:
    
            avg_steal_timer = (avg_steal_timer + steal_timer) / 2;
    
    This ensures that avg_steal_timer is actually a naive average of steal
    timer values. It now closely follows steal timer values but of course
    in a smoother manner.

    rds: tcp: Fix use-after-free of net in reqsk_timer_handler().
    
    [ Upstream commit 2a750d6a5b365265dbda33330a6188547ddb5c24 ]
    
    syzkaller reported a warning of netns tracker [0] followed by KASAN
    splat [1] and another ref tracker warning [1].
    
    syzkaller could not find a repro, but in the log, the only suspicious
    sequence was as follows:
    
      18:26:22 executing program 1:
      r0 = socket$inet6_mptcp(0xa, 0x1, 0x106)
      ...
      connect$inet6(r0, &(0x7f0000000080)={0xa, 0x4001, 0x0, @loopback}, 0x1c) (async)
    
    The notable thing here is 0x4001 in connect(), which is RDS_TCP_PORT.
    
    So, the scenario would be:
    
      1. unshare(CLONE_NEWNET) creates a per netns tcp listener in
          rds_tcp_listen_init().
      2. syz-executor connect()s to it and creates a reqsk.
      3. syz-executor exit()s immediately.
      4. netns is dismantled.  [0]
      5. reqsk timer is fired, and UAF happens while freeing reqsk.  [1]
      6. listener is freed after RCU grace period.  [2]
    
    Basically, reqsk assumes that the listener guarantees netns safety
    until all reqsk timers are expired by holding the listener's refcount.
    However, this was not the case for kernel sockets.
    
    Commit 740ea3c4a0b2 ("tcp: Clean up kernel listener's reqsk in
    inet_twsk_purge()") fixed this issue only for per-netns ehash.
    
    Let's apply the same fix for the global ehash.

    tcp: Fix NEW_SYN_RECV handling in inet_twsk_purge()
    
    [ Upstream commit 1c4e97dd2d3c9a3e84f7e26346aa39bc426d3249 ]
    
    inet_twsk_purge() uses rcu to find TIME_WAIT and NEW_SYN_RECV
    objects to purge.
    
    These objects use SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU semantic and need special
    care. We need to use refcount_inc_not_zero(&sk->sk_refcnt).
    
    Reuse the existing correct logic I wrote for TIME_WAIT,
    because both structures have common locations for
    sk_state, sk_family, and netns pointer.
    
    If after the refcount_inc_not_zero() the object fields longer match
    the keys, use sock_gen_put(sk) to release the refcount.
    
    Then we can call inet_twsk_deschedule_put() for TIME_WAIT,
    inet_csk_reqsk_queue_drop_and_put() for NEW_SYN_RECV sockets,
    with BH disabled.
    
    Then we need to restart the loop because we had drop rcu_read_lock().

    ASoC: rockchip: i2s-tdm: Fix inaccurate sampling rates
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e2ab4b18ebd46813fc3459207335af4d368e323 ]
    
    The sample rates set by the rockchip_i2s_tdm driver in master mode are
    inaccurate up to 5% in several cases, due to the driver logic to configure
    clocks and a nasty interaction with the Common Clock Framework.
    
    To understand what happens, here is the relevant section of the clock tree
    (slightly simplified), along with the names used in the driver:
    
           vpll0 _OR_ vpll1               "mclk_root"
              clk_i2s2_8ch_tx_src         "mclk_parent"
                 clk_i2s2_8ch_tx_mux
                    clk_i2s2_8ch_tx       "mclk" or "mclk_tx"
    
    This is what happens when playing back e.g. at 192 kHz using
    audio-graph-card (when recording the same applies, only s/tx/rx/):
    
     0. at probe, rockchip_i2s_tdm_set_sysclk() stores the passed frequency in
        i2s_tdm->mclk_tx_freq (*) which is 50176000, and that is never modified
        afterwards
    
     1. when playback is started, rockchip_i2s_tdm_hw_params() is called and
        does the following two calls
    
     2. rockchip_i2s_tdm_calibrate_mclk():
    
        2a. selects mclk_root0 (vpll0) as a parent for mclk_parent
            (mclk_tx_src), which is OK because the vpll0 rate is a good for
            192000 (and sumbultiple) rates
    
        2b. sets the mclk_root frequency based on ppm calibration computations
    
        2c. sets mclk_tx_src to 49152000 (= 256 * 192000), which is also OK as
            it is a multiple of the required bit clock
    
     3. rockchip_i2s_tdm_set_mclk()
    
        3a. calls clk_set_rate() to set the rate of mclk_tx (clk_i2s2_8ch_tx)
            to the value of i2s_tdm->mclk_tx_freq (*), i.e. 50176000 which is
            not a multiple of the sampling frequency -- this is not OK
    
            3a1. clk_set_rate() reacts by reparenting clk_i2s2_8ch_tx_src to
                 vpll1 -- this is not OK because the default vpll1 rate can be
                 divided to get 44.1 kHz and related rates, not 192 kHz
    
    The result is that the driver does a lot of ad-hoc decisions about clocks
    and ends up in using the wrong parent at an unoptimal rate.
    
    Step 0 is one part of the problem: unless the card driver calls set_sysclk
    at each stream start, whatever rate is set in mclk_tx_freq during boot will
    be taken and used until reboot. Moreover the driver does not care if its
    value is not a multiple of any audio frequency.
    
    Another part of the problem is that the whole reparenting and clock rate
    setting logic is conflicting with the CCF algorithms to achieve largely the
    same goal: selecting the best parent and setting the closest clock
    rate. And it turns out that only calling once clk_set_rate() on
    clk_i2s2_8ch_tx picks the correct vpll and sets the correct rate.
    
    The fix is based on removing the custom logic in the driver to select the
    parent and set the various clocks, and just let the Clock Framework do it
    all. As a side effect, the set_sysclk() op becomes useless because we now
    let the CCF compute the appropriate value for the sampling rate.  It also
    implies that the whole calibration logic is now dead code and so it is
    removed along with the "PCM Clock Compensation in PPM" kcontrol, which has
    always been broken anyway. The handling of the 4 optional clocks also
    becomes dead code and is removed.
    
    The actual rates have been tested playing 30 seconds of audio at various
    sampling rates before and after this change using sox:
    
        time play -r <sample_rate> -n synth 30 sine 950 gain -3
    
    The time reported in the table below is the 'real' value reported by the
    'time' command in the above command line.
    
         rate        before     after
       ---------     ------     ------
         8000 Hz     30.60s     30.63s
        11025 Hz     30.45s     30.51s
        16000 Hz     30.47s     30.50s
        22050 Hz     30.78s     30.41s
        32000 Hz     31.02s     30.43s
        44100 Hz     30.78s     30.41s
        48000 Hz     29.81s     30.45s
        88200 Hz     30.78s     30.41s
        96000 Hz     29.79s     30.42s
       176400 Hz     27.40s     30.41s
       192000 Hz     29.79s     30.42s
    
    While the tests are running the clock tree confirms that:
    
     * without the patch, vpll1 is always used and clk_i2s2_8ch_tx always
       produces 50176000 Hz, which cannot be divided for most audio rates
       except the slowest ones, generating inaccurate rates
     * with the patch:
       - for 192000 Hz vpll0 is used
       - for 176400 Hz vpll1 is used
       - clk_i2s2_8ch_tx always produces (256 * <rate>) Hz
    
    Tested on the RK3308 using the internal audio codec.

    rtc: mt6397: select IRQ_DOMAIN instead of depending on it
    
    [ Upstream commit 544c42f798e1651dcb04fb0395219bf0f1c2607e ]
    
    IRQ_DOMAIN is a hidden (not user visible) symbol. Users cannot set
    it directly thru "make *config", so drivers should select it instead
    of depending on it if they need it.
    Relying on it being set for a dependency is risky.
    
    Consistently using "select" or "depends on" can also help reduce
    Kconfig circular dependency issues.
    
    Therefore, change the use of "depends on" for IRQ_DOMAIN to
    "select" for RTC_DRV_MT6397.

    The if (c >= 20 && c <= 0x3f) test added in commit 7a99565f8732 is
    wrong.  20 is DC4 in ascii and it makes no sense to consider that as the
    bottom limit. Instead, it should be 0x20 as in the other test in
    the commit above. This is supposed to NOT change anything as we handle
    interesting 20-0x20 asciis far before this if.
    
    So for sakeness, change to 0x20 (which is SPACE).

    comedi: comedi_test: Prevent timers rescheduling during deletion
    
    commit f53641a6e849034a44bf80f50245a75d7a376025 upstream.
    
    The comedi_test devices have a couple of timers (ai_timer and ao_timer)
    that can be started to simulate hardware interrupts.  Their expiry
    functions normally reschedule the timer.  The driver code calls either
    del_timer_sync() or del_timer() to delete the timers from the queue, but
    does not currently prevent the timers from rescheduling themselves so
    synchronized deletion may be ineffective.
    
    Add a couple of boolean members (one for each timer: ai_timer_enable and
    ao_timer_enable) to the device private data structure to indicate
    whether the timers are allowed to reschedule themselves.  Set the member
    to true when adding the timer to the queue, and to false when deleting
    the timer from the queue in the waveform_ai_cancel() and
    waveform_ao_cancel() functions.
    
    The del_timer_sync() function is also called from the waveform_detach()
    function, but the timer enable members will already be set to false when
    that function is called, so no change is needed there.

    This is clear from the stack trace, we call nfs4_ff_layout_prepare_ds()

    clean it all up and our check is only for if (!mirror->mirror_ds).  This
    is inconsistent with the rest of the users of mirror_ds, which have
    
      if (IS_ERR_OR_NULL(mirror_ds))
    
    to keep from tripping over this exact scenario.  Fix this up in
    ff_layout_cancel_io() to make sure we don't panic when we get an error.
    I also spot checked all the other instances of checking mirror_ds and we
    appear to be doing the correct checks everywhere, only unconditionally
    dereferencing mirror_ds when we know it would be valid.

    [ Upstream commit ad8c91282c95f801c37812d59d2d9eba6899b384 ]
    
    When bringing a CPU online, some of the PMC and LBR related registers
    are reset. The same is done when a CPU is taken offline although that
    is unnecessary. This currently happens in the "cpu_dead" callback which
    is also incorrect as the callback runs on a control CPU instead of the
    one that is being taken offline. This also affects hibernation and
    suspend to RAM on some platforms as reported in the link below.

    f2fs: compress: fix reserve_cblocks counting error when out of space
    
    [ Upstream commit 2f6d721e14b69d6e1251f69fa238b48e8374e25f ]
    
    When a file only needs one direct_node, performing the following
    operations will cause the file to be unrepairable:
    
    unisoc # ./f2fs_io compress test.apk
    unisoc #df -h | grep dm-48
    /dev/block/dm-48 112G 112G 1.2M 100% /data
    
    unisoc # ./f2fs_io release_cblocks test.apk
    924
    unisoc # df -h | grep dm-48
    /dev/block/dm-48 112G 112G 4.8M 100% /data
    
    unisoc # dd if=/dev/random of=file4 bs=1M count=3
    3145728 bytes (3.0 M) copied, 0.025 s, 120 M/s
    unisoc # df -h | grep dm-48
    /dev/block/dm-48 112G 112G 1.8M 100% /data
    
    unisoc # ./f2fs_io reserve_cblocks test.apk
    F2FS_IOC_RESERVE_COMPRESS_BLOCKS failed: No space left on device
    
    adb reboot
    unisoc # df -h  | grep dm-48
    /dev/block/dm-48             112G 112G   11M 100% /data
    unisoc # ./f2fs_io reserve_cblocks test.apk
    0
    
    This is because the file has only one direct_node. After returning
    to -ENOSPC, reserved_blocks += ret will not be executed. As a result,
    the reserved_blocks at this time is still 0, which is not the real
    number of reserved blocks. Therefore, fsck cannot be set to repair
    the file.
    
    After this patch, the fsck flag will be set to fix this problem.
    
    unisoc # df -h | grep dm-48
    /dev/block/dm-48             112G 112G  1.8M 100% /data
    unisoc # ./f2fs_io reserve_cblocks test.apk

    watchdog: stm32_iwdg: initialize default timeout
    
    [ Upstream commit dbd7c0088b7f44aa0b9276ed3449df075a7b5b54 ]
    
    The driver never sets a default timeout value, therefore it is
    initialized to zero. When CONFIG_WATCHDOG_HANDLE_BOOT_ENABLED is
    enabled, the watchdog is started during probe. The kernel is supposed to
    automatically ping the watchdog from this point until userspace takes
    over, but this does not happen if the configured timeout is zero. A zero
    timeout causes watchdog_need_worker() to return false, so the heartbeat
    worker does not run and the system therefore resets soon after the
    driver is probed.
    
    This patch fixes this by setting an arbitrary non-zero default timeout.
    The default could be read from the hardware instead, but I didn't see
    any reason to add this complexity.
    
    This has been tested on an STM32F746.

    NFSv4.2: fix listxattr maximum XDR buffer size
    
    [ Upstream commit bcac8bff90a6ee1629f90669cdb9d28fb86049b0 ]
    
    Switch order of operations to avoid creating a short XDR buffer:
    e.g., buflen = 12, old xdrlen = 12, new xdrlen = 20.
    
    Having a short XDR buffer leads to lxa_maxcount be a few bytes
    less than what is needed to retrieve the whole list when using
    a buflen as returned by a call with size = 0:
        buflen = listxattr(path, NULL, 0);
        buf = malloc(buflen);
        buflen = listxattr(path, buf, buflen);
    
    For a file with one attribute (name = '123456'), the first call
    with size = 0 will return buflen = 12 ('user.123456\x00').
    The second call with size = 12, sends LISTXATTRS with
    lxa_maxcount = 12 + 8 (cookie) + 4 (array count) = 24. The
    XDR buffer needs 8 (cookie) + 4 (array count) + 4 (name count)
    + 6 (name len) + 2 (padding) + 4 (eof) = 28 which is 4 bytes
    shorter than the lxa_maxcount provided in the call.

    NFSv4.2: fix nfs4_listxattr kernel BUG at mm/usercopy.c:102
    
    [ Upstream commit 251a658bbfceafb4d58c76b77682c8bf7bcfad65 ]
    
    A call to listxattr() with a buffer size = 0 returns the actual
    size of the buffer needed for a subsequent call. When size > 0,
    nfs4_listxattr() does not return an error because either
    generic_listxattr() or nfs4_listxattr_nfs4_label() consumes
    exactly all the bytes then size is 0 when calling
    nfs4_listxattr_nfs4_user() which then triggers the following
    kernel BUG:

    Issue is reproduced when generic_listxattr() returns 'system.nfs4_acl',
    thus calling lisxattr() with size = 16 will trigger the bug.
    
    Add check on nfs4_listxattr() to return ERANGE error when it is
    called with size > 0 and the return value is greater than size.

    level, so that zstd_min_clevel() may return a negative number, then w/
    below mount option, .compress_level can be configed w/ a negative number,
    which is not allowed to f2fs, let's add check condition to avoid it.

    scsi: bfa: Fix function pointer type mismatch for hcb_qe->cbfn
    
    [ Upstream commit b69600231f751304db914c63b937f7098ed2895c ]
    
    Some callback functions used here take a boolean argument, others take a
    status argument. This breaks KCFI type checking, so clang now warns about
    the function pointer cast:
    
    drivers/scsi/bfa/bfad_bsg.c:2138:29: error: cast from 'void (*)(void *, enum bfa_status)' to 'bfa_cb_cbfn_t' (aka 'void (*)(void *, enum bfa_boolean)') converts to incompatible function type [-Werror,-Wcast-function-type-strict]
    
    Assuming the code is actually correct here and the callers always match the
    argument types of the callee, rework this to replace the explicit cast with
    a union of the two pointer types. This does not change the behavior of the
    code, so if something is actually broken here, a larger rework may be
    necessary.

    RDMA/device: Fix a race between mad_client and cm_client init
    
    [ Upstream commit 7a8bccd8b29c321ac181369b42b04fecf05f98e2 ]
    
    The mad_client will be initialized in enable_device_and_get(), while the
    devices_rwsem will be downgraded to a read semaphore. There is a window
    that leads to the failed initialization for cm_client, since it can not
    get matched mad port from ib_mad_port_list, and the matched mad port will
    be added to the list after that.

    RDMA/hns: Fix mis-modifying default congestion control algorithm
    
    [ Upstream commit d20a7cf9f714f0763efb56f0f2eeca1cb91315ed ]
    
    Commit 27c5fd271d8b ("RDMA/hns: The UD mode can only be configured
    with DCQCN") adds a check of congest control alorithm for UD. But
    that patch causes a problem: hr_dev->caps.congest_type is global,
    used by all QPs, so modifying this field to DCQCN for UD QPs causes
    other QPs unable to use any other algorithm except DCQCN.
    
    Revert the modification in commit 27c5fd271d8b ("RDMA/hns: The UD
    mode can only be configured with DCQCN"). Add a new field cong_type
    to struct hns_roce_qp and configure DCQCN for UD QPs.

    f2fs: fix to avoid potential panic during recovery
    
    [ Upstream commit 21ec68234826b1b54ab980a8df6e33c74cfbee58 ]
    
    During recovery, if FAULT_BLOCK is on, it is possible that
    f2fs_reserve_new_block() will return -ENOSPC during recovery,
    then it may trigger panic.
    
    Also, if fault injection rate is 1 and only FAULT_BLOCK fault
    type is on, it may encounter deadloop in loop of block reservation.
    
    Let's change as below to fix these issues:
    - remove bug_on() to avoid panic.
    - limit the loop count of block reservation to avoid potential
    deadloop.

    Upon rare occasions, KASAN reports a use-after-free Write
    in srpt_refresh_port().
    
    This seems to be because an event handler is registered before the
    srpt device is fully setup and a race condition upon error may leave a
    partially setup event handler in place.
    
    Instead, only register the event handler after srpt device initialization
    is complete.

    RDMA/irdma: Allow accurate reporting on QP max send/recv WR
    
    [ Upstream commit 3a8498720450174b8db450d3375a04dca81b3534 ]
    
    Currently the attribute cap.max_send_wr and cap.max_recv_wr
    sent from user-space during create QP are the provider computed
    SQ/RQ depth as opposed to raw values passed from application.
    This inhibits computation of an accurate value for max_send_wr
    and max_recv_wr for this QP in the kernel which matches the value
    returned in user create QP. Also these capabilities needs to be
    reported from the driver in query QP.
    
    Add support by extending the ABI to allow the raw cap.max_send_wr and
    cap.max_recv_wr to be passed from user-space, while keeping compatibility
    for the older scheme.
    
    The internal HW depth and shift needed for the WQs needs to be computed
    now for both kernel and user-mode QPs. Add new helpers to assist with this:
    irdma_uk_calc_depth_shift_sq, irdma_uk_calc_depth_shift_rq and
    irdma_uk_calc_depth_shift_wq.
    
    Consolidate all the user mode QP setup into a new function
    irdma_setup_umode_qp which keeps it with its counterpart
    irdma_setup_kmode_qp.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: fix ALC285 issues on HP Envy x360 laptops
    
    [ Upstream commit c062166995c9e57d5cd508b332898f79da319802 ]
    
    Realtek codec on HP Envy laptop series are heavily modified by vendor.
    Therefore, need intervention to make it work properly. The patch fixes:
    
    - B&O soundbar speakers (between lid and keyboard) activation
    - Enable LED on mute button
    - Add missing process coefficient which affects the output amplifier
    - Volume control synchronization between B&O soundbar and side speakers
    - Unmute headset output on several HP Envy models
    - Auto-enable headset mic when plugged
    
    This patch was tested on HP Envy x360 13-AR0107AU with Realtek ALC285
    
    The only unsolved problem is output amplifier of all built-in speakers
    is too weak, which causes volume of built-in speakers cannot be loud
    as vendor's proprietary driver due to missing _DSD parameter in the
    firmware. The solution is currently on research. Expected to has another
    patch in the future.
    
    Potential fix to related issues, need test before close those issues:

    bug will happen.

    clk: Fix clk_core_get NULL dereference
    
    [ Upstream commit e97fe4901e0f59a0bfd524578fe3768f8ca42428 ]
    
    It is possible for clk_core_get to dereference a NULL in the following
    sequence:
    
    clk_core_get()
        of_clk_get_hw_from_clkspec()
            __of_clk_get_hw_from_provider()
                __clk_get_hw()
    
    __clk_get_hw() can return NULL which is dereferenced by clk_core_get() at
    hw->core.
    
    Prior to commit dde4eff47c82 ("clk: Look for parents with clkdev based
    clk_lookups") the check IS_ERR_OR_NULL() was performed which would have
    caught the NULL.
    
    Reading the description of this function it talks about returning NULL but
    that cannot be so at the moment.
    
    Update the function to check for hw before dereferencing it and return NULL
    if hw is NULL.

    modules: wait do_free_init correctly
    
    [ Upstream commit 8f8cd6c0a43ed637e620bbe45a8d0e0c2f4d5130 ]
    
    The synchronization here is to ensure the ordering of freeing of a module
    init so that it happens before W+X checking.  It is worth noting it is not
    that the freeing was not happening, it is just that our sanity checkers
    raced against the permission checkers which assume init memory is already
    gone.
    
    Commit 1a7b7d922081 ("modules: Use vmalloc special flag") moved calling
    do_free_init() into a global workqueue instead of relying on it being
    called through call_rcu(..., do_free_init), which used to allowed us call
    do_free_init() asynchronously after the end of a subsequent grace period.
    The move to a global workqueue broke the gaurantees for code which needed
    to be sure the do_free_init() would complete with rcu_barrier().  To fix
    this callers which used to rely on rcu_barrier() must now instead use
    flush_work(&init_free_wq).
    
    Without this fix, we still could encounter false positive reports in W+X
    checking since the rcu_barrier() here can not ensure the ordering now.
    
    Even worse, the rcu_barrier() can introduce significant delay.  Eric
    Chanudet reported that the rcu_barrier introduces ~0.1s delay on a
    PREEMPT_RT kernel.

      [    0.402442] Run /sbin/init as init process
    
    With this fix, the above delay can be eliminated.

    powerpc/hv-gpci: Fix the H_GET_PERF_COUNTER_INFO hcall return value checks

    The above error is because of the hcall failure as required
    permission "Enable Performance Information Collection" is not set.
    Based on current code, single_gpci_request function did not check the
    error type incase hcall fails and by default returns EINVAL. But we can
    have other reasons for hcall failures like H_AUTHORITY/H_PARAMETER with
    detail_rc as GEN_BUF_TOO_SMALL, for which we need to act accordingly.
    
    Fix this issue by adding new checks in the single_gpci_request and
    h_gpci_event_init functions.

    drm/mediatek: Fix a null pointer crash in mtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flip
    
    [ Upstream commit c958e86e9cc1b48cac004a6e245154dfba8e163b ]
    
    It's possible that mtk_crtc->event is NULL in
    mtk_drm_crtc_finish_page_flip().
    
    pending_needs_vblank value is set by mtk_crtc->event, but in
    mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's is not guarded by the same
    lock in mtk_drm_finish_page_flip(), thus a race condition happens.
    
    Consider the following case:
    
    CPU1                              CPU2
    step 1:
    mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_begin()
    mtk_crtc->event is not null,
                                      step 1:
                                      mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush:
                                      mtk_drm_crtc_update_config(
                                          !!mtk_crtc->event)
    step 2:
    mtk_crtc_ddp_irq ->
    mtk_drm_finish_page_flip:
    lock
    mtk_crtc->event set to null,
    pending_needs_vblank set to false
    unlock
                                      pending_needs_vblank set to true,
    
                                      step 2:
                                      mtk_crtc_ddp_irq ->
                                      mtk_drm_finish_page_flip called again,
                                      pending_needs_vblank is still true
                                      //null pointer
    
    Instead of guarding the entire mtk_drm_crtc_atomic_flush(), it's more
    efficient to just check if mtk_crtc->event is null before use.

    gpio: nomadik: fix offset bug in nmk_pmx_set()
    
    [ Upstream commit 53cf6b72e074864b94ade97dcb6f30b5ac1a82dc ]
    
    Previously, the statement looked like:
    
        slpm[x] &= ~BIT(g->grp.pins[i]);
    
    Where:
     - slpm is a unsigned int pointer;
     - g->grp.pins[i] is a pin number. It can grow to more than 32.
    
    The expected shift amount is a pin bank offset.
    
    This bug does not occur on every group or pin: the altsetting must be
    NMK_GPIO_ALT_C and the pin must be 32 or above. It might have occured.
    For example, in pinctrl-nomadik-db8500.c, pin group i2c3_c_2 has the
    right altsetting and pins 229 and 230.

    the number slots or their width. However, these will impact the bit clock
    rate.
    
    Hitting the 100MHz limit is very unlikely for most use cases but it is
    possible.
    
    For example with 32 slots / 32 bits wide, the maximum rate is no longer
    384kHz but ~96kHz.
    
    Add the constraint accordingly if the component is not already active.
    If it is active, the rate is already constrained by the first stream rate.

    ASoC: meson: axg-tdm-interface: fix mclk setup without mclk-fs
    
    [ Upstream commit e3741a8d28a1137f8b19ae6f3d6e3be69a454a0a ]
    
    By default, when mclk-fs is not provided, the tdm-interface driver
    requests an MCLK that is 4x the bit clock, SCLK.
    
    However there is no justification for this:
    
    * If the codec needs MCLK for its operation, mclk-fs is expected to be set
      according to the codec requirements.
    * If the codec does not need MCLK the minimum is 2 * SCLK, because this is
      minimum the divider between SCLK and MCLK can do.
    
    Multiplying by 4 may cause problems because the PLL limit may be reached
    sooner than it should, so use 2x instead.

    drm/tidss: Fix sync-lost issue with two displays
    
    [ Upstream commit c079e2e113f2ec2803ba859bbb442a6ab82c96bd ]
    
    A sync lost issue can be observed with two displays, when moving a plane
    from one disabled display to an another disabled display, and then
    enabling the display to which the plane was moved to. The exact
    requirements for this to trigger are not clear.
    
    It looks like the issue is that the layers are left enabled in the first
    display's OVR registers. Even if the corresponding VP is disabled, it
    still causes an issue, as if the disabled VP and its OVR would still be
    in use, leading to the same VID being used by two OVRs. However, this is
    just speculation based on testing the DSS behavior.
    
    Experimentation shows that as a workaround, we can disable all the
    layers in the OVR when disabling a VP. There should be no downside to
    this, as the OVR is anyway effectively disabled if its VP is disabled,
    and it seems to solve the sync lost issue.
    
    However, there may be a bigger issue in play here, related to J721e
    erratum i2097 ("DSS: Disabling a Layer Connected to Overlay May Result
    in Synclost During the Next Frame"). Experimentation also shows that the
    OVR's CHANNELIN field has similar issue. So we may need to revisit this
    when we find out more about the core issue.

    drm/tidss: Fix initial plane zpos values
    
    [ Upstream commit 3ec948ccb2c4b99e8fbfdd950adbe92ea577b395 ]
    
    When the driver sets up the zpos property it sets the default zpos value
    to the HW id of the plane. That is fine as such, but as on many DSS
    versions the driver arranges the DRM planes in a different order than
    the HW planes (to keep the non-scalable planes first), this leads to odd
    initial zpos values. An example is J721e, where the initial zpos values
    for DRM planes are 1, 3, 0, 2.
    
    In theory the userspace should configure the zpos values properly when
    using multiple planes, and in that sense the initial zpos values
    shouldn't matter, but there's really no reason not to fix this and help
    the userspace apps which don't handle zpos perfectly. In particular,
    some versions of Weston seem to have issues dealing with the planes
    with the current default zpos values.
    
    So let's change the zpos values for the DRM planes to 0, 1, 2, 3.
    
    Another option would be to configure the planes marked as primary planes
    to zpos 0. On a two display system this would give us plane zpos values
    of 0, 0, 1, 2. The end result and behavior would be very similar in this
    option, and I'm not aware that this would actually help us in any way.
    So, to keep the code simple, I opted for the 0, 1, 2, 3 values.

    [ Upstream commit baf67aefbe7d7deafa59ca49612d163f8889934c ]
    
    Per PCIe r6.1, sec 2.2.6.2 and 7.5.3.4, a Requester may not use 8-bit Tags
    unless its Extended Tag Field Enable is set, but all Receivers/Completers
    must handle 8-bit Tags correctly regardless of their Extended Tag Field
    Enable.
    
    Some devices do not handle 8-bit Tags as Completers, so add a quirk for
    them.  If we find such a device, we disable Extended Tags for the entire
    hierarchy to make peer-to-peer DMA possible.
    
    The 3ware 9650SE seems to have issues with handling 8-bit tags. Mark it as
    broken.

    [ Upstream commit fae6f815505301b92d9113764f4d76d0bfe45607 ]
    
    The register bits definitions for RGB666 formats are wrong in multiple
    ways: first, in the DSI_PS_SEL bits region, the Packed 18-bits RGB666
    format is selected with bit 1, while the Loosely Packed one is bit 2,
    and second - the definition name "LOOSELY_PS_18BIT_RGB666" is wrong
    because the loosely packed format is 24 bits instead!
    
    Either way, functions mtk_dsi_ps_control_vact() and mtk_dsi_ps_control()
    do not even agree on the DSI_PS_SEL bit to set in DSI_PSCTRL: one sets
    loosely packed (24) on RGB666, the other sets packed (18), and the other
    way around for RGB666_PACKED.
    
    Fixing this entire stack of issues is done in one go:
     - Use the correct bit for the Loosely Packed RGB666 definition
     - Rename LOOSELY_PS_18BIT_RGB666 to LOOSELY_PS_24BIT_RGB666
     - Change ps_bpp_mode in mtk_dsi_ps_control_vact() to set:
        - Loosely Packed, 24-bits for MIPI_DSI_FMT_RGB666
        - Packed, 18-bits for MIPI_DSI_FMT_RGB666_PACKED

    Instead, just use size of whole buffer. There is no harm in doing this.

    [ Upstream commit 0ee952c2f484ee0059f7ce4951aaa3cb0eda96dd ]
    
    Currently mv col aux buffers are allocated as a pool. This is not
    optimal because pool size equals number of buffers before stream is
    started. Buffers can easily be allocated afterwards. In such cases,
    invalid pointer is assigned to the decoding frame and Cedrus might
    overwrite memory location which is allocated to different task.
    
    Solve this issue with allocating mv col buffer once capture buffer is
    actually used.

    NTB: fix possible name leak in ntb_register_device()
    
    [ Upstream commit aebfdfe39b9327a3077d0df8db3beb3160c9bdd0 ]
    
    If device_register() fails in ntb_register_device(), the device name
    allocated by dev_set_name() should be freed. As per the comment in
    device_register(), callers should use put_device() to give up the
    reference in the error path. So fix this by calling put_device() in the
    error path so that the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup().
    
    As a result of this, put_device() in the error path of
    ntb_register_device() is removed and the actual error is returned.

    ALSA: seq: fix function cast warnings

    clang-16 points out a control flow integrity (kcfi) issue when event
    callbacks get converted to incompatible types:
    
    sound/core/seq/seq_midi.c:135:30: error: cast from 'int (*)(struct snd_rawmidi_substream *, const char *, int)' to 'snd_seq_dump_func_t' (aka 'int (*)(void *, void *, int)') converts to incompatible function type [-Werror,-Wcast-function-type-strict]

    For addressing those errors, introduce wrapper functions that are used
    for callbacks and bridge to the actual function call with pointer
    cast.

    Currently INTF_CFG2_DATA_HCTL_EN is coupled with the enablement
    of widebus but this is incorrect because we should be enabling
    this bit independent of widebus except for cases where compression
    is enabled in one pixel per clock mode.

    INTF_CFG2_DATA_HCTL_EN for all other cases when supported by DPU.

    dquot_free_inode                        quota_off
                                              drop_dquot_ref
                                               remove_dquot_ref
                                               dquots = i_dquot(inode)
      dquots = i_dquot(inode)
      srcu_read_lock
      dquots[cnt]) != NULL (1)
                                                 dquots[type] = NULL (2)
      spin_lock(&dquots[cnt]->dq_dqb_lock) (3)
       ....
    
    If dquot_free_inode(or other routines) checks inode's quota pointers (1)
    before quota_off sets it to NULL(2) and use it (3) after that, NULL pointer
    dereference will be triggered.
    
    So let's fix it by using a temporary pointer to avoid this issue.

    quota: simplify drop_dquot_ref()
    
    [ Upstream commit 7bce48f0fec602b3b6c335963b26d9eefa417788 ]
    
    As Honza said, remove_inode_dquot_ref() currently does not release the
    last dquot reference but instead adds the dquot to tofree_head list. This
    is because dqput() can sleep while dropping of the last dquot reference
    (writing back the dquot and calling ->release_dquot()) and that must not
    happen under dq_list_lock. Now that dqput() queues the final dquot cleanup
    into a workqueue, remove_inode_dquot_ref() can call dqput() unconditionally
    and we can significantly simplify it.
    
    Here we open code the simplified code of remove_inode_dquot_ref() into
    remove_dquot_ref() and remove the function put_dquot_list() which is no
    longer used.

    Trying to toggle the resets in a rapid fashion can lead to the changes
    not actually arriving at the clock controller block when we expect them
    to. This was observed at least on SM8250.
    
    Read back the value after regmap_update_bits to ensure write completion.

    media: edia: dvbdev: fix a use-after-free
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c64f4cdf4e6cc5682c52523713af8c39c94e6d5 ]
    
    In dvb_register_device, *pdvbdev is set equal to dvbdev, which is freed
    in several error-handling paths. However, *pdvbdev is not set to NULL
    after dvbdev's deallocation, causing use-after-frees in many places,
    for example, in the following call chain:
    
    budget_register
      |-> dvb_dmxdev_init
            |-> dvb_register_device
      |-> dvb_dmxdev_release
            |-> dvb_unregister_device
                  |-> dvb_remove_device
                        |-> dvb_device_put
                              |-> kref_put
    
    When calling dvb_unregister_device, dmxdev->dvbdev (i.e. *pdvbdev in
    dvb_register_device) could point to memory that had been freed in
    dvb_register_device. Thereafter, this pointer is transferred to
    kref_put and triggering a use-after-free.

    clk: samsung: exynos850: Propagate SPI IPCLK rate change
    
    [ Upstream commit 67c15187d4910ee353374676d4dddf09d8cb227e ]
    
    When SPI transfer is being prepared, the spi-s3c64xx driver will call
    clk_set_rate() to change the rate of SPI source clock (IPCLK). But IPCLK
    is a gate (leaf) clock, so it must propagate the rate change up the
    clock tree, so that corresponding DIV clocks can actually change their
    divider values. Add CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT flag to corresponding clocks for
    all SPI instances in Exynos850 (spi_0, spi_1 and spi_2) to make it
    possible. This change involves next clocks:
    
    usi_spi_0:

    With input clock of 400 MHz, this scheme provides next IPCLK rate range,
    for each SPI block:
    
        SPI0:   781 kHz ... 400 MHz
        SPI1/2: 1.6 MHz ... 400 MHz
    
    Accounting for internal /4 divider in SPI blocks, and because the max
    SPI frequency is limited at 50 MHz, it gives us next SPI SCK rates:
    
        SPI0:   200 kHz ... 49.9 MHz
        SPI1/2: 400 kHz ... 49.9 MHz
    
    Which should cover all possible applications of SPI bus. Of course,
    setting SPI frequency to values as low as 500 kHz will also affect the
    common bus dividers (dout_apm_bus or dout_peri_ip), which in turn
    effectively lowers the rates for all leaf bus clocks derived from those
    dividers, like HSI2C and I3C clocks. But at least it gives the board
    designer a choice, whether to keep all clocks (SPI/HSI2C/I3C) at high
    frequencies, or make all those clocks have lower frequencies. Not
    propagating the rate change to those common dividers would limit this
    choice to "only high frequencies are allowed for SPI/HSI2C/I3C" option,
    making the common dividers useless. This decision follows the "Worse is
    better" approach, relying on the users/engineers to know the system
    internals when working with such low-level features, instead of trying
    to account for all possible use-cases.

    drm/rockchip: inno_hdmi: Fix video timing
    
    [ Upstream commit 47a145c03484d33e65d773169d5ca1b9fe2a492e ]
    
    The controller wants the difference between *total and *sync_start in the
    HDMI_VIDEO_EXT_*DELAY registers. Otherwise the signal is very unstable for
    certain non-VIC modes. See downstream commit [0].

    [ Upstream commit 0800880f4eb789b7d299db40f2e86e056bd33a4e ]
    
    The pm_runtime_enable function increases the power disable depth,
    which means that we must perform a matching decrement on the error
    handling path to maintain balance within the given context.
    Additionally, we need to address the same issue for pm_runtime_get_sync.
    We fix this by invoking pm_runtime_disable and pm_runtime_put_sync

    dm: call the resume method on internal suspend
    
    [ Upstream commit 65e8fbde64520001abf1c8d0e573561b4746ef38 ]
    
    There is this reported crash when experimenting with the lvm2 testsuite.
    The list corruption is caused by the fact that the postsuspend and resume
    methods were not paired correctly; there were two consecutive calls to the
    origin_postsuspend function. The second call attempts to remove the
    "hash_list" entry from a list, while it was already removed by the first
    call.
    
    Fix __dm_internal_resume so that it calls the preresume and resume
    methods of the table's targets.
    
    If a preresume method of some target fails, we are in a tricky situation.
    We can't return an error because dm_internal_resume isn't supposed to
    return errors. We can't return success, because then the "resume" and
    "postsuspend" methods would not be paired correctly. So, we set the
    DMF_SUSPENDED flag and we fake normal suspend - it may confuse userspace
    tools, but it won't cause a kernel crash.

    Use 2MB * num_possible_nodes() as the size for allocations done through
    the prog pack allocator. On most architectures, PMD_SIZE will be equal

    net: kcm: fix incorrect parameter validation in the kcm_getsockopt) function

    The 'len' variable can't be negative when assigned the result of
    'min_t' because all 'min_t' parameters are cast to unsigned int,
    and then the minimum one is chosen.
    
    To fix the logic, check 'len' as read from 'optlen',
    where the types of relevant variables are (signed) int.

    [ Upstream commit 4469c0c5b14a0919f5965c7ceac96b523eb57b79 ]
    
    The phy_get_internal_delay function could try to access to an empty
    array in the case that the driver is calling phy_get_internal_delay
    without defining delay_values and rx-internal-delay-ps or
    tx-internal-delay-ps is defined to 0 in the device-tree.
    This will lead to "unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at
    virtual address 0". To avoid this kernel oops, the test should be delay
    >= 0. As there is already delay < 0 test just before, the test could
    only be size == 0.

    ipv6: fib6_rules: flush route cache when rule is changed
    
    [ Upstream commit c4386ab4f6c600f75fdfd21143f89bac3e625d0d ]
    
    When rule policy is changed, ipv6 socket cache is not refreshed.
    The sock's skb still uses a outdated route cache and was sent to
    a wrong interface.
    
    To avoid this error we should update fib node's version when
    rule is changed. Then skb's route will be reroute checked as
    route cache version is already different with fib node version.
    The route cache is refreshed to match the latest rule.

    iommu/vt-d: Retrieve IOMMU perfmon capability information
    
    [ Upstream commit a6a5006dad572a53b5df3f47e1471d207ae9ba49 ]
    
    The performance monitoring infrastructure, perfmon, is to support
    collection of information about key events occurring during operation of
    the remapping hardware, to aid performance tuning and debug. Each
    remapping hardware unit has capability registers that indicate support
    for performance monitoring features and enumerate the capabilities.
    
    Add alloc_iommu_pmu() to retrieve IOMMU perfmon capability information
    for each iommu unit. The information is stored in the iommu->pmu data
    structure. Capability registers are read-only, so it's safe to prefetch
    and store them in the pmu structure. This could avoid unnecessary VMEXIT
    when this code is running in the virtualization environment.
    
    Add free_iommu_pmu() to free the saved capability information when
    freeing the iommu unit.
    
    Add a kernel config option for the IOMMU perfmon feature. Unless a user
    explicitly uses the perf tool to monitor the IOMMU perfmon event, there
    isn't any impact for the existing IOMMU. Enable it by default.

    bpf: Fix stackmap overflow check on 32-bit arches
    
    [ Upstream commit 7a4b21250bf79eef26543d35bd390448646c536b ]
    
    The stackmap code relies on roundup_pow_of_two() to compute the number
    of hash buckets, and contains an overflow check by checking if the
    resulting value is 0. However, on 32-bit arches, the roundup code itself
    can overflow by doing a 32-bit left-shift of an unsigned long value,
    which is undefined behaviour, so it is not guaranteed to truncate
    neatly. This was triggered by syzbot on the DEVMAP_HASH type, which
    contains the same check, copied from the hashtab code.
    
    The commit in the fixes tag actually attempted to fix this, but the fix
    did not account for the UB, so the fix only works on CPUs where an
    overflow does result in a neat truncation to zero, which is not
    guaranteed. Checking the value before rounding does not have this
    problem.

    bpf: Fix DEVMAP_HASH overflow check on 32-bit arches
    
    [ Upstream commit 281d464a34f540de166cee74b723e97ac2515ec3 ]
    
    The devmap code allocates a number hash buckets equal to the next power
    of two of the max_entries value provided when creating the map. When
    rounding up to the next power of two, the 32-bit variable storing the
    number of buckets can overflow, and the code checks for overflow by
    checking if the truncated 32-bit value is equal to 0. However, on 32-bit
    arches the rounding up itself can overflow mid-way through, because it
    ends up doing a left-shift of 32 bits on an unsigned long value. If the
    size of an unsigned long is four bytes, this is undefined behaviour, so
    there is no guarantee that we'll end up with a nice and tidy 0-value at
    the end.
    
    Syzbot managed to turn this into a crash on arm32 by creating a
    DEVMAP_HASH with max_entries > 0x80000000 and then trying to update it.
    Fix this by moving the overflow check to before the rounding up
    operation.

    s390/cache: prevent rebuild of shared_cpu_list
    
    [ Upstream commit cb0cd4ee11142339f2d47eef6db274290b7a482d ]
    
    With commit 36bbc5b4ffab ("cacheinfo: Allow early detection and population
    of cache attributes") the shared cpu list for each cache level higher than
    L1 is rebuilt even if the list already has been set up.
    
    This is caused by the removal of the cpumask_empty() check within
    cache_shared_cpu_map_setup().
    
    However architectures can enforce that the shared cpu list is not rebuilt
    by simply setting cpu_map_populated of the per cpu cache info structure to
    true, which is also the fix for this problem.
    
    Before:
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cache/index2/shared_cpu_list
    0-7
    
    After:
    $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/cache/index2/shared_cpu_list

    Bluetooth: hci_core: Cancel request on command timeout
    
    [ Upstream commit 63298d6e752fc0ec7f5093860af8bc9f047b30c8 ]
    
    If command has timed out call __hci_cmd_sync_cancel to notify the
    hci_req since it will inevitably cause a timeout.
    
    This also rework the code around __hci_cmd_sync_cancel since it was
    wrongly assuming it needs to cancel timer as well, but sometimes the
    timers have not been started or in fact they already had timed out in
    which case they don't need to be cancel yet again.

    Bluetooth: hci_conn: Consolidate code for aborting connections
    
    [ Upstream commit a13f316e90fdb1fb6df6582e845aa9b3270f3581 ]
    
    This consolidates code for aborting connections using
    hci_cmd_sync_queue so it is synchronized with other threads, but
    because of the fact that some commands may block the cmd_sync_queue
    while waiting specific events this attempt to cancel those requests by
    using hci_cmd_sync_cancel.

    Bluetooth: hci_sync: Only allow hci_cmd_sync_queue if running
    
    [ Upstream commit d883a4669a1def6d121ccf5e64ad28260d1c9531 ]
    
    This makes sure hci_cmd_sync_queue only queue new work if HCI_RUNNING
    has been set otherwise there is a risk of commands being sent while
    turning off.
    
    Because hci_cmd_sync_queue can no longer queue work while HCI_RUNNING is
    not set it cannot be used to power on adapters so instead
    hci_cmd_sync_submit is introduced which bypass the HCI_RUNNING check, so
    it behaves like the old implementation.

    Bluetooth: Cancel sync command before suspend and power off
    
    [ Upstream commit f419863588217f76eaf754e1dfce21ea7fcb026d ]
    
    Some of the sync commands might take a long time to complete, e.g.
    LE Create Connection when the peer device isn't responding might take
    20 seconds before it times out. If suspend command is issued during
    this time, it will need to wait for completion since both commands are
    using the same sync lock.
    
    This patch cancel any running sync commands before attempting to
    suspend or adapter power off.

    The optional variants for the gpiod_get() family of functions return NULL
    if the GPIO in question is not associated with this device. They return
    ERR_PTR() on any other error. NULL descriptors are graciously handled by
    GPIOLIB and can be safely passed to any of the GPIO consumer interfaces
    as they will return 0 and act as if the function succeeded. If one is
    using the optional variant, then there's no point in checking for NULL.

    Bluetooth: Remove superfluous call to hci_conn_check_pending()
    
    [ Upstream commit 78e3639fc8031275010c3287ac548c0bc8de83b1 ]
    
    The "pending connections" feature was originally introduced with commit
    4c67bc74f016 ("[Bluetooth] Support concurrent connect requests") and
    6bd57416127e ("[Bluetooth] Handling pending connect attempts after
    inquiry") to handle controllers supporting only a single connection request
    at a time. Later things were extended to also cancel ongoing inquiries on
    connect() with commit 89e65975fea5 ("Bluetooth: Cancel Inquiry before
    Create Connection").
    
    With commit a9de9248064b ("[Bluetooth] Switch from OGF+OCF to using only
    opcodes"), hci_conn_check_pending() was introduced as a helper to
    consolidate a few places where we check for pending connections (indicated
    by the BT_CONNECT2 flag) and then try to connect.
    
    This refactoring commit also snuck in two more calls to
    hci_conn_check_pending():
    
    - One is in the failure callback of hci_cs_inquiry(), this one probably
    makes sense: If we send an "HCI Inquiry" command and then immediately
    after a "Create Connection" command, the "Create Connection" command might
    fail before the "HCI Inquiry" command, and then we want to retry the
    "Create Connection" on failure of the "HCI Inquiry".
    
    - The other added call to hci_conn_check_pending() is in the event handler
    for the "Remote Name" event, this seems unrelated and is possibly a
    copy-paste error, so remove that one.

    Bluetooth: mgmt: Remove leftover queuing of power_off work
    
    [ Upstream commit fee054b7579fe252f8b9e6c17b9c5bfdaa84dd7e ]
    
    Queuing of power_off work was introduced in these functions with commits
    8b064a3ad377 ("Bluetooth: Clean up HCI state when doing power off") and
    c9910d0fb4fc ("Bluetooth: Fix disconnecting connections in non-connected
    states") in an effort to clean up state and do things like disconnecting
    devices before actually powering off the device.
    
    After that, commit a3172b7eb4a2 ("Bluetooth: Add timer to force power off")
    introduced a timeout to ensure that the device actually got powered off,
    even if some of the cleanup work would never complete.
    
    This code later got refactored with commit cf75ad8b41d2 ("Bluetooth:
    hci_sync: Convert MGMT_SET_POWERED"), which made powering off the device
    synchronous and removed the need for initiating the power_off work from
    other places. The timeout mentioned above got removed too, because we now
    also made use of the command timeout during power on/off.
    
    These days the power_off work still exists, but it only seems to only be
    used for HCI_AUTO_OFF functionality, which is why we never noticed
    those two leftover places where we queue power_off work. So let's remove
    that code.

    igb: Fix missing time sync events
    
    [ Upstream commit ee14cc9ea19ba9678177e2224a9c58cce5937c73 ]
    
    Fix "double" clearing of interrupts, which can cause external events
    or timestamps to be missed.
    
    The E1000_TSIRC Time Sync Interrupt Cause register can be cleared in two
    ways, by either reading it or by writing '1' into the specific cause
    bit. This is documented in section 8.16.1.
    
    The following flow was used:
        1. read E1000_TSIRC into 'tsicr';
        2. handle the interrupts present into 'tsirc' and mark them in 'ack';
        3. write 'ack' into E1000_TSICR;
    
    As both (1) and (3) will clear the interrupt cause, if the same
    interrupt happens again between (1) and (3) it will be ignored,
    causing events to be missed.
    
    Remove the extra clear in (3).

    For those endpoint devices connect to system via hotplug capable ports,
    users could request a hot reset to the device by flapping device's link
    through setting the slot's link control register, as pciehp_ist() DLLSC
    interrupt sequence response, pciehp will unload the device driver and
    then power it off. thus cause an IOMMU device-TLB invalidation (Intel
    VT-d spec, or ATS Invalidation in PCIe spec r6.1) request for non-existence
    target device to be sent and deadly loop to retry that request after ITE
    fault triggered in interrupt context.
    
    That would cause following continuous hard lockup warning and system hang

    Such issue could be triggered by all kinds of regular surprise removal
    hotplug operation. like:
    
    1. pull EP(endpoint device) out directly.
    2. turn off EP's power.
    3. bring the link down.
    etc.
    
    this patch aims to work for regular safe removal and surprise removal
    unplug. these hot unplug handling process could be optimized for fix the
    ATS Invalidation hang issue by calling pci_dev_is_disconnected() in
    function devtlb_invalidation_with_pasid() to check target device state to
    avoid sending meaningless ATS Invalidation request to iommu when device is
    gone. (see IMPLEMENTATION NOTE in PCIe spec r6.1 section 10.3.1)
    
    For safe removal, device wouldn't be removed until the whole software
    handling process is done, it wouldn't trigger the hard lock up issue
    caused by too long ATS Invalidation timeout wait. In safe removal path,
    device state isn't set to pci_channel_io_perm_failure in
    pciehp_unconfigure_device() by checking 'presence' parameter, calling
    pci_dev_is_disconnected() in devtlb_invalidation_with_pasid() will return
    false there, wouldn't break the function.
    
    For surprise removal, device state is set to pci_channel_io_perm_failure in
    pciehp_unconfigure_device(), means device is already gone (disconnected)
    call pci_dev_is_disconnected() in devtlb_invalidation_with_pasid() will
    return true to break the function not to send ATS Invalidation request to
    the disconnected device blindly, thus avoid to trigger further ITE fault,
    and ITE fault will block all invalidation request to be handled.
    furthermore retry the timeout request could trigger hard lockup.
    
    safe removal (present) & surprise removal (not present)
    
    pciehp_ist()
       pciehp_handle_presence_or_link_change()
         pciehp_disable_slot()
           remove_board()
             pciehp_unconfigure_device(presence) {
               if (!presence)
                    pci_walk_bus(parent, pci_dev_set_disconnected, NULL);
               }
    
    this patch works for regular safe removal and surprise removal of ATS
    capable endpoint on PCIe switch downstream ports.

    Beside pci_device_is_present() function, this one has no config space

    This is caused by a mistake in the chip initialisation. This version of
    the chip requires loading an extra AGC table right after the main one,
    but the extra table is being loaded at the wrong time, in
    rtw_chip_board_info_setup().

    The rtw_chip_board_info_setup() can only do "software" things, and

    ACPI: CPPC: enable AMD CPPC V2 support for family 17h processors
    
    [ Upstream commit a51ab63b297ce9e26e3ffb9be896018a42d5f32f ]
    
    As there are some AMD processors which only support CPPC V2 firmware and
    BIOS implementation, the amd_pstate driver will be failed to load when
    system booting with below kernel warning message:
    
    [    0.477523] amd_pstate: the _CPC object is not present in SBIOS or ACPI disabled
    
    To make the amd_pstate driver can be loaded on those TR40 processors, it
    needs to match x86_model from 0x30 to 0x7F for family 17H.
    With the change, the system can load amd_pstate driver as expected.

    x86, relocs: Ignore relocations in .notes section
    
    [ Upstream commit aaa8736370db1a78f0e8434344a484f9fd20be3b ]
    
    When building with CONFIG_XEN_PV=y, .text symbols are emitted into
    the .notes section so that Xen can find the "startup_xen" entry point.
    This information is used prior to booting the kernel, so relocations
    are not useful. In fact, performing relocations against the .notes
    section means that the KASLR base is exposed since /sys/kernel/notes
    is world-readable.
    
    To avoid leaking the KASLR base without breaking unprivileged tools that
    are expecting to read /sys/kernel/notes, skip performing relocations in
    the .notes section. The values readable in .notes are then identical to
    those found in System.map.

    [ Upstream commit 793551c965116d9dfaf0550dacae1396a20efa69 ]
    
    It is generally invalid to fail a Device Check notification if the scan
    handler has not been attached to the given device after a bus rescan,
    because there may be valid reasons for the scan handler to refuse
    attaching to the device (for example, the device is not ready).
    
    For this reason, modify acpi_scan_device_check() to return 0 in that
    case without printing a warning.
    
    While at it, reduce the log level of the "already enumerated" message
    in the same function, because it is only interesting when debugging
    notification handling

    ACPI: resource: Add Infinity laptops to irq1_edge_low_force_override
    
    [ Upstream commit e2605d4039a42a03000856b3229932455717b48b ]
    
    A user reported a keyboard problem similar to ones reported with other
    Zen laptops, on an Infinity E15-5A165-BM.
    
    Add board name matches for this model and one (untested) close relative
    to irq1_edge_low_force_override.

    ARM: dts: imx6dl-yapp4: Move the internal switch PHYs under the switch node
    
    [ Upstream commit 79978bff2e4b8e05ebdf5fc3ee6b794002393484 ]
    
    We identified that the PHYs actually do not work since commit 7da7b84fee58
    ("ARM: dts: imx6dl-yapp4: Move phy reset into switch node") as
    a coincidence of several circumstances.
    
    The reset signal is kept asserted by a pull-down resistor on the board
    unless it is deasserted by GPIO from the SoC. This is to keep the switch
    dead until it is configured properly by the kernel and user space.
    
    Prior to the referenced commit the switch was reset by the FEC driver
    and the reset GPIO was actively deasserted. The mdio-bus was scanned
    and the attached switch and its PHYs were found and configured.
    
    With the referenced commit the switch is reset by the qca8k driver.
    Because of another bug in the qca8k driver, functionality of the reset
    pin depends on its pre-kernel configuration. See commit c44fc98f0a8f
    ("net: dsa: qca8k: fix illegal usage of GPIO")
    
    The problem did not appear until we removed support for the switch
    and configuration of its reset pin from the bootloader.
    
    To fix that, properly describe the internal mdio-bus configuration of
    the qca8334 switch. The PHYs are internal to the switch and sit on its
    internal mdio-bus.

    This change does not have any functional effect. The switch works just
    fine without this patch as it has full access to all the addresses
    on the bus. This is simply a clean-up to set the node name address
    and reg address to the same value.

    [ Upstream commit a43e0fc5e9134a46515de2f2f8d4100b74e50de3 ]

    When the development chip ROM was added, the "direct-mapped" compatible
    value was already obsolete.  In addition, the device node lacked the
    accompanying "probe-type" property, causing the old physmap_of_core
    driver to fall back to trying all available probe types.
    Unfortunately this fallback was lost when the DT and pdata cases were
    merged.
    
    Fix this by using the modern "mtd-rom" compatible value instead.

    wifi: wilc1000: revert reset line logic flip
    
    [ Upstream commit f3ec643947634bed41b97bd56b248f7c78498eab ]
    
    This reverts commit fcf690b0b47494df51d214db5c5a714a400b0257.
    
    When using a wilc1000 chip over a spi bus, users can optionally define a
    reset gpio and a chip enable gpio. The reset line of wilc1000 is active
    low, so to hold the chip in reset, a low (physical) value must be applied.
    
    The corresponding device tree binding documentation was introduced by
    commit f31ee3c0a555 ("wilc1000: Document enable-gpios and reset-gpios
    properties") and correctly indicates that the reset line is an active-low
    signal. The corresponding driver part, brought by commit ec031ac4792c
    ("wilc1000: Add reset/enable GPIO support to SPI driver") was applying the
    correct logic. But commit fcf690b0b474 ("wifi: wilc1000: use correct
    sequence of RESET for chip Power-UP/Down") eventually flipped this logic
    and started misusing the gpiod APIs, applying an inverted logic when
    powering up/down the chip (for example, setting the reset line to a logic
    "1" during power up, which in fact asserts the reset line when device tree
    describes the reset line as GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW). As a consequence, any
    platform currently using the driver in SPI mode must use a faulty reset
    line description in device tree, or else chip will be maintained in reset
    and will not even allow to bring up the chip.
    
    Fix reset line usage by inverting back the gpiod APIs usage, setting the
    reset line to the logic value "0" when powering the chip, and the logic
    value "1" when powering off the chip.

    firmware: arm_scmi: Fix double free in SMC transport cleanup path
    
    [ Upstream commit f1d71576d2c9ec8fdb822173fa7f3de79475e9bd ]
    
    When the generic SCMI code tears down a channel, it calls the chan_free
    callback function, defined by each transport. Since multiple protocols
    might share the same transport_info member, chan_free() might want to
    clean up the same member multiple times within the given SCMI transport
    implementation. In this case, it is SMC transport. This will lead to a NULL
    pointer dereference at the second time:

    iommu/amd: Mark interrupt as managed
    
    [ Upstream commit 0feda94c868d396fac3b3cb14089d2d989a07c72 ]
    
    On many systems that have an AMD IOMMU the following sequence of
    warnings is observed during bootup.
    
    ```
    pci 0000:00:00.2  can't derive routing for PCI INT A
    pci 0000:00:00.2: PCI INT A: not connected
    ```
    
    This series of events happens because of the IOMMU initialization
    sequence order and the lack of _PRT entries for the IOMMU.
    
    During initialization the IOMMU driver first enables the PCI device
    using pci_enable_device().  This will call acpi_pci_irq_enable()
    which will check if the interrupt is declared in a PCI routing table
    (_PRT) entry. According to the PCI spec [1] these routing entries
    are only required under PCI root bridges:
            The _PRT object is required under all PCI root bridges
    
    The IOMMU is directly connected to the root complex, so there is no
    parent bridge to look for a _PRT entry. The first warning is emitted
    since no entry could be found in the hierarchy. The second warning is
    then emitted because the interrupt hasn't yet been configured to any
    value.  The pin was configured in pci_read_irq() but the byte in
    PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE return 0xff which means "Unknown".
    
    After that sequence of events pci_enable_msi() is called and this
    will allocate an interrupt.
    
    That is both of these warnings are totally harmless because the IOMMU
    uses MSI for interrupts.  To avoid even trying to probe for a _PRT
    entry mark the IOMMU as IRQ managed. This avoids both warnings.

    wifi: wilc1000: prevent use-after-free on vif when cleaning up all interfaces
    
    [ Upstream commit cb5942b77c05d54310a0420cac12935e9b6aa21c ]

    observed on interface registration error path, or simply by
    removing the module/unbinding device from driver:

    David Mosberger-Tan initial investigation [1] showed that this
    use-after-free is due to netdevice unregistration during vif list
    traversal. When unregistering a net device, since the needs_free_netdev has
    been set to true during registration, the netdevice object is also freed,
    and as a consequence, the corresponding vif object too, since it is
    attached to it as private netdevice data. The next occurrence of the loop
    then tries to access freed vif pointer to the list to move forward in the
    list.
    
    Fix this use-after-free thanks to two mechanisms:
    - navigate in the list with list_for_each_entry_safe, which allows to
      safely modify the list as we go through each element. For each element,
      remove it from the list with list_del_rcu
    - make sure to wait for RCU grace period end after each vif removal to make
      sure it is safe to free the corresponding vif too (through
      unregister_netdev)
    
    Since we are in a RCU "modifier" path (not a "reader" path), and because
    such path is expected not to be concurrent to any other modifier (we are
    using the vif_mutex lock), we do not need to use RCU list API, that's why
    we can benefit from list_for_each_entry_safe.

    Note that the non-ECC-corrected qfprom can be found at 0xfc4b8000

    which should have equivalent values at all offsets compared to the

    bpf: Mark bpf_spin_{lock,unlock}() helpers with notrace correctly
    
    [ Upstream commit 178c54666f9c4d2f49f2ea661d0c11b52f0ed190 ]
    
    Currently tracing is supposed not to allow for bpf_spin_{lock,unlock}()
    helper calls. This is to prevent deadlock for the following cases:
      - there is a prog (prog-A) calling bpf_spin_{lock,unlock}().
      - there is a tracing program (prog-B), e.g., fentry, attached
        to bpf_spin_lock() and/or bpf_spin_unlock().
      - prog-B calls bpf_spin_{lock,unlock}().
    For such a case, when prog-A calls bpf_spin_{lock,unlock}(),
    a deadlock will happen.
    
    The related source codes are below in kernel/bpf/helpers.c:
      notrace BPF_CALL_1(bpf_spin_lock, struct bpf_spin_lock *, lock)
      notrace BPF_CALL_1(bpf_spin_unlock, struct bpf_spin_lock *, lock)
    notrace is supposed to prevent fentry prog from attaching to
    bpf_spin_{lock,unlock}().
    
    But actually this is not the case and fentry prog can successfully
    attached to bpf_spin_lock(). Siddharth Chintamaneni reported
    the issue in [1]. The following is the macro definition for
    above BPF_CALL_1:
      #define BPF_CALL_x(x, name, ...)                                               \
            static __always_inline                                                 \
            u64 ____##name(__BPF_MAP(x, __BPF_DECL_ARGS, __BPF_V, __VA_ARGS__));   \
            typedef u64 (*btf_##name)(__BPF_MAP(x, __BPF_DECL_ARGS, __BPF_V, __VA_ARGS__)); \
            u64 name(__BPF_REG(x, __BPF_DECL_REGS, __BPF_N, __VA_ARGS__));         \
            u64 name(__BPF_REG(x, __BPF_DECL_REGS, __BPF_N, __VA_ARGS__))          \
            {                                                                      \
                    return ((btf_##name)____##name)(__BPF_MAP(x,__BPF_CAST,__BPF_N,__VA_ARGS__));\
            }                                                                      \
            static __always_inline                                                 \
            u64 ____##name(__BPF_MAP(x, __BPF_DECL_ARGS, __BPF_V, __VA_ARGS__))
    
      #define BPF_CALL_1(name, ...)   BPF_CALL_x(1, name, __VA_ARGS__)
    
    The notrace attribute is actually applied to the static always_inline function
    ____bpf_spin_{lock,unlock}(). The actual callback function
    bpf_spin_{lock,unlock}() is not marked with notrace, hence
    allowing fentry prog to attach to two helpers, and this
    may cause the above mentioned deadlock. Siddharth Chintamaneni
    actually has a reproducer in [2].
    
    To fix the issue, a new macro NOTRACE_BPF_CALL_1 is introduced which
    will add notrace attribute to the original function instead of
    the hidden always_inline function and this fixed the problem.

    The commit adding the ChromeOS EC to the Asurada Devicetree mistakenly
    added a base detection node. While tablet mode detection is supported by
    CrosEC and used by Hayato, it is done through the cros-ec-keyb driver.
    The base detection node, which is handled by the hid-google-hammer
    driver, also provides tablet mode detection but by checking base
    attachment status on the CrosEC, which is not supported for Asurada.
    
    Hence, remove the unused CrosEC base detection node for Asurada.

    arm64: dts: mt8183: Move CrosEC base detection node to kukui-based DTs
    
    [ Upstream commit 04bd6411f506357fd1faedc2b2156e7ef206aa9a ]
    
    The cbas node is used to describe base detection functionality in the
    ChromeOS EC, which is used for units that have a detachable keyboard and
    thus rely on this functionality to switch between tablet and laptop
    mode.
    
    Despite the original commit having added the cbas node to the
    mt8183-kukui.dtsi, not all machines that include it are detachables. In
    fact all machines that include from mt8183-kukui-jacuzzi.dtsi are either
    clamshells (ie normal laptops) or convertibles, meaning the keyboard can
    be flipped but not detached. The detection for the keyboard getting
    flipped is handled by the driver bound to the keyboard-controller node
    in the EC.
    
    Move the base detection node from the base kukui dtsi to the dtsis where
    all machines are detachables, and thus actually make use of the node.

    As discussed in the past (commit 2d3916f31891 ("ipv6: fix skb drops

    selftests: forwarding: Add missing multicast routing config entries
    
    [ Upstream commit f0ddf15f0a74c27eb4b2271a90e69948acc3fa2c ]
    
    The two tests that make use of multicast routig (router.sh and
    router_multicast.sh) are currently failing in the netdev CI because the
    kernel is missing multicast routing support.
    
    Fix by adding the required config entries.

    [ Upstream commit 4acf4e62cd572b0c806035046b3698f5585ab821 ]
    
    The config file contains a partial kernel configuration to be used by
    `virtme-configkernel --custom'. The presumption is that the config file
    contains all Kconfig options needed by the selftests from the directory.
    
    In net/forwarding/config, many are missing, which manifests as spurious
    failures when running the selftests, with messages about unknown device
    types, qdisc kinds or classifier actions. Add the missing configurations.
    
    Tested the resulting configuration using virtme-ng as follows:
    
     # vng -b -f tools/testing/selftests/net/forwarding/config
     # vng --user root
     (within the VM:)

    s390/vdso: drop '-fPIC' from LDFLAGS
    
    [ Upstream commit 0628c03934187be33942580e10bb9afcc61adeed ]
    
    '-fPIC' as an option to the linker does not do what it seems like it
    should. With ld.bfd, it is treated as '-f PIC', which does not make
    sense based on the meaning of '-f':
    
      -f SHLIB, --auxiliary SHLIB Auxiliary filter for shared object symbol table
    
    When building with ld.lld (currently under review in a GitHub pull
    request), it just errors out because '-f' means nothing and neither does
    '-fPIC':
    
      ld.lld: error: unknown argument '-fPIC'
    
    '-fPIC' was blindly copied from CFLAGS when the vDSO stopped being
    linked with '$(CC)', it should not be needed. Remove it to clear up the
    build failure with ld.lld.

    s390/pai: fix attr_event_free upper limit for pai device drivers
    
    [ Upstream commit 225d09d6e5f3870560665a1829d2db79330b4c58 ]
    
    When the device drivers are initialized, a sysfs directory
    is created. This contains many attributes which are allocated with
    kzalloc(). Should it fail, the memory for the attributes already
    created is freed in attr_event_free(). Its second parameter is number
    of attribute elements to delete. This parameter is off by one.
    When i. e. the 10th attribute fails to get created, attributes
    numbered 0 to 9 should be deleted. Currently only attributes
    numbered 0 to 8 are deleted.

    [ Upstream commit d5bd4041cd70faf26fc9a54bd6f172537bbe77f3 ]
    
    The firmware (later) actually uses the values even for keys
    that are invalid as far as the host is concerned, later in
    rekeying, and then only sets the low 48 bits since the PNs
    are only 48 bits over the air. It does, however, compare the
    full 64 bits later, obviously causing problems.
    
    Remove the memset and use kzalloc instead to avoid any old
    heap data leaking to the firmware. We already init all the
    other fields in the struct anyway. This leaves the data set
    to zero for any unused fields, so the firmware can look at
    them safely even if they're not used right now.

    tools/resolve_btfids: Fix cross-compilation to non-host endianness
    
    [ Upstream commit 903fad4394666bc23975c93fb58f137ce64b5192 ]
    
    The .BTF_ids section is pre-filled with zeroed BTF ID entries during the
    build and afterwards patched by resolve_btfids with correct values.
    Since resolve_btfids always writes in host-native endianness, it relies
    on libelf to do the translation when the target ELF is cross-compiled to
    a different endianness (this was introduced in commit 61e8aeda9398
    ("bpf: Fix libelf endian handling in resolv_btfids")).
    
    Unfortunately, the translation will corrupt the flags fields of SET8
    entries because these were written during vmlinux compilation and are in
    the correct endianness already. This will lead to numerous selftests
    failures such as:
    
        $ sudo ./test_verifier 502 502
        #502/p sleepable fentry accept FAIL
        Failed to load prog 'Invalid argument'!
        bpf_fentry_test1 is not sleepable
        verification time 34 usec
        stack depth 0
        processed 0 insns (limit 1000000) max_states_per_insn 0 total_states 0 peak_states 0 mark_read 0
        Summary: 0 PASSED, 0 SKIPPED, 1 FAILED
    
    Since it's not possible to instruct libelf to translate just certain
    values, let's manually bswap the flags (both global and entry flags) in
    resolve_btfids when needed, so that libelf then translates everything
    correctly.

    tools/resolve_btfids: Refactor set sorting with types from btf_ids.h
    
    [ Upstream commit 9707ac4fe2f5bac6406d2403f8b8a64d7b3d8e43 ]
    
    Instead of using magic offsets to access BTF ID set data, leverage types
    from btf_ids.h (btf_id_set and btf_id_set8) which define the actual
    layout of the data. Thanks to this change, set sorting should also
    continue working if the layout changes.
    
    This requires to sync the definition of 'struct btf_id_set8' from
    include/linux/btf_ids.h to tools/include/linux/btf_ids.h. We don't sync
    the rest of the file at the moment, b/c that would require to also sync
    multiple dependent headers and we don't need any other defs from
    btf_ids.h.

    [ Upstream commit 5f623835584f1c8d1030666796f40c47a448ce0b ]
    
    The driver only used the number of pwm channels to set the pwm_chip's
    npwm member. The result is that if there are more capture channels than
    PWM channels specified in the device tree, only a part of the capture
    channel is usable. Fix that by passing the bigger channel count to the
    pwm framework. This makes it possible that the .apply() callback is
    called with .hwpwm >= pwm_num_devs, catch that case and return an error
    code.

    printk: Disable passing console lock owner completely during panic()
    
    [ Upstream commit d04d5882cd678b898a9d7c5aee6afbe9e6e77fcd ]
    
    The commit d51507098ff91 ("printk: disable optimistic spin
    during panic") added checks to avoid becoming a console waiter
    if a panic is in progress.
    
    However, the transition to panic can occur while there is
    already a waiter. The current owner should not pass the lock to
    the waiter because it might get stopped or blocked anytime.
    
    Also the panic context might pass the console lock owner to an
    already stopped waiter by mistake. It might happen when
    console_flush_on_panic() ignores the current lock owner, for
    example:
    
    CPU0                                CPU1
    ----                                ----
    console_lock_spinning_enable()
                                        console_trylock_spinning()
                                          [CPU1 now console waiter]
    NMI: panic()
      panic_other_cpus_shutdown()
                                        [stopped as console waiter]
      console_flush_on_panic()
        console_lock_spinning_enable()
        [print 1 record]
        console_lock_spinning_disable_and_check()
          [handover to stopped CPU1]
    
    This results in panic() not flushing the panic messages.
    
    Fix these problems by disabling all spinning operations
    completely during panic().
    
    Another advantage is that it prevents possible deadlocks caused
    by "console_owner_lock". The panic() context does not need to
    take it any longer. The lockless checks are safe because the
    functions become NOPs when they see the panic in progress. All
    operations manipulating the state are still synchronized by the
    lock even when non-panic CPUs would notice the panic
    synchronously.
    
    The current owner might stay spinning. But non-panic() CPUs
    would get stopped anyway and the panic context will never start
    spinning.

    However, since the kernel is build optimized, it seems the stack is not

    is obvious in this function: memory allocated by ieee80211_beacon_get()
    is never released. Fixing this leak makes kmemleak happy.

    wifi: libertas: fix some memleaks in lbs_allocate_cmd_buffer()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5f0e4aede01cb01fa633171f0533affd25328c3a ]
    
    In the for statement of lbs_allocate_cmd_buffer(), if the allocation of
    cmdarray[i].cmdbuf fails, both cmdarray and cmdarray[i].cmdbuf needs to
    be freed. Otherwise, there will be memleaks in lbs_allocate_cmd_buffer().

    wifi: ath11k: initialize rx_mcs_80 and rx_mcs_160 before use
    
    [ Upstream commit b802e7b7e771dee3377d071418281f8b64d2d832 ]
    
    Currently in ath11k_peer_assoc_h_he() rx_mcs_80 and rx_mcs_160
    are used to calculate max_nss, see
            if (support_160)
                    max_nss = min(rx_mcs_80, rx_mcs_160);
            else
                    max_nss = rx_mcs_80;
    
    Kernel test robot complains on uninitialized symbols:
    drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath11k/mac.c:2321 ath11k_peer_assoc_h_he() error: uninitialized symbol 'rx_mcs_80'.
    drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath11k/mac.c:2321 ath11k_peer_assoc_h_he() error: uninitialized symbol 'rx_mcs_160'.
    drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath11k/mac.c:2323 ath11k_peer_assoc_h_he() error: uninitialized symbol 'rx_mcs_80'.
    
    This is because there are some code paths that never set them, so
    the assignment of max_nss can come from uninitialized variables.
    This could result in some unknown issues since a wrong peer_nss
    might be passed to firmware.
    
    Change to initialize them to an invalid value at the beginning. This
    makes sense because even max_nss gets an invalid value, due to either
    or both of them being invalid, we can get an valid peer_nss with
    following guard:
            arg->peer_nss = min(sta->deflink.rx_nss, max_nss)

    always "chip" for pwm_chips.

    pwm: atmel-hlcdc: Convert to platform remove callback returning void
    
    [ Upstream commit 5fce94170ad8a67b839f3dd8e8e8a87039ba0251 ]
    
    The .remove() callback for a platform driver returns an int which makes
    many driver authors wrongly assume it's possible to do error handling by
    returning an error code. However the value returned is (mostly) ignored
    and this typically results in resource leaks. To improve here there is a
    quest to make the remove callback return void. In the first step of this
    quest all drivers are converted to .remove_new() which already returns
    void.
    
    Trivially convert this driver from always returning zero in the remove
    callback to the void returning variant.

    wifi: ath9k: delay all of ath9k_wmi_event_tasklet() until init is complete
    
    [ Upstream commit 24355fcb0d4cbcb6ddda262596558e8cfba70f11 ]
    
    The ath9k_wmi_event_tasklet() used in ath9k_htc assumes that all the data
    structures have been fully initialised by the time it runs. However, because of
    the order in which things are initialised, this is not guaranteed to be the
    case, because the device is exposed to the USB subsystem before the ath9k driver
    initialisation is completed.
    
    We already committed a partial fix for this in commit:
    8b3046abc99e ("ath9k_htc: fix NULL pointer dereference at ath9k_htc_tx_get_packet()")
    
    However, that commit only aborted the WMI_TXSTATUS_EVENTID command in the event
    tasklet, pairing it with an "initialisation complete" bit in the TX struct. It
    seems syzbot managed to trigger the race for one of the other commands as well,
    so let's just move the existing synchronisation bit to cover the whole
    tasklet (setting it at the end of ath9k_htc_probe_device() instead of inside
    ath9k_tx_init()).

    By introducing its usage, commit 788715b5f21c ("cpufreq: mediatek-hw:

    if no supply was present in any of the CPU DT nodes.
    
    Use devm_regulator_get() instead since the CPUs do require supplies
    even if not described in the DT. It will gracefully return a dummy
    regulator if none is found in the DT node, allowing probe to succeed.

    As part of that merge prepping Arm DT support 13 years ago, they

    and of.h. As a result, there's a pretty much random mix of those include

    debugfs_create_dir() returns ERR_PTR and never return NULL.
    
    As Russell suggested, this patch removes the error checking for
    debugfs_create_dir(). This is because the DebugFS kernel API is developed
    in a way that the caller can safely ignore the errors that occur during
    the creation of DebugFS nodes. The debugfs APIs have a IS_ERR() judge in
    start_creating() which can handle it gracefully. So these checks are
    unnecessary.

    [ Upstream commit 12cfc9c8d3faf887a202c89bc312202445fca7e8 ]
    
    Adding then removing a second vif currently makes the first vif not working
    anymore. This is visible for example when we have a first interface
    connected to some access point:
    - create a wpa_supplicant.conf with some AP credentials
    - wpa_supplicant -Dnl80211 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -i wlan0
    - dhclient wlan0
    - iw phy phy0 interface add wlan1 type managed
    - iw dev wlan1 del
    wlan0 does not manage properly traffic anymore (eg: ping not working)
    
    This is due to vif mode being incorrectly reconfigured with some default
    values in del_virtual_intf, affecting by default first vif.
    
    Prevent first vif from being affected on second vif removal by removing vif
    mode change command in del_virtual_intf

    wifi: wilc1000: do not realloc workqueue everytime an interface is added
    
    [ Upstream commit 328efda22af81130c2ad981c110518cb29ff2f1d ]
    
    Commit 09ed8bfc5215 ("wilc1000: Rename workqueue from "WILC_wq" to
    "NETDEV-wq"") moved workqueue creation in wilc_netdev_ifc_init in order to
    set the interface name in the workqueue name. However, while the driver
    needs only one workqueue, the wilc_netdev_ifc_init is called each time we
    add an interface over a phy, which in turns overwrite the workqueue with a
    new one. This can be observed with the following commands:
    
    for i in $(seq 0 10)
    do
      iw phy phy0 interface add wlan1 type managed
      iw dev wlan1 del
    done
    ps -eo pid,comm|grep wlan

     98 kworker/R-wlan1

    123 kworker/R-wlan1
    126 kworker/R-wlan1
    129 kworker/R-wlan1
    
    Fix this leakage by putting back hif_workqueue allocation in
    wilc_cfg80211_init. Regarding the workqueue name, it is indeed relevant to
    set it lowercase, however it is not  attached to a specific netdev, so
    enforcing netdev name in the name is not so relevant. Still, enrich the
    name with the wiphy name to make it clear which phy is using the workqueue.

    Fix RCU dereference usage by moving it to a RCU read critical section. To
    avoid wrapping the whole wilc_parse_join_bss_param under the critical

    wifi: b43: Disable QoS for bcm4331
    
    [ Upstream commit 09795bded2e725443fe4a4803cae2079cdaf7b26 ]
    
    bcm4331 seems to not function correctly with QoS support. This may be due
    to issues with currently available firmware or potentially a device
    specific issue.
    
    When queues that are not of the default "best effort" priority are
    selected, traffic appears to not transmit out of the hardware while no
    errors are returned. This behavior is present among all the other priority
    queues: video, voice, and background. While this can be worked around by
    setting a kernel parameter, the default behavior is problematic for most
    users and may be difficult to debug. This patch offers a working out-of-box
    experience for bcm4331 users.
    
    Log of the issue (using ssh low-priority traffic as an example):

    sched/fair: Take the scheduling domain into account in select_idle_core()
    
    [ Upstream commit 23d04d8c6b8ec339057264659b7834027f3e6a63 ]
    
    When picking a CPU on task wakeup, select_idle_core() has to take
    into account the scheduling domain where the function looks for the CPU.
    
    This is because the "isolcpus" kernel command line option can remove CPUs
    from the domain to isolate them from other SMT siblings.
    
    This change replaces the set of CPUs allowed to run the task from
    p->cpus_ptr by the intersection of p->cpus_ptr and sched_domain_span(sd)
    which is stored in the 'cpus' argument provided by select_idle_cpu().

    timekeeping: Fix cross-timestamp interpolation for non-x86
    
    [ Upstream commit 14274d0bd31b4debf28284604589f596ad2e99f2 ]
    
    So far, get_device_system_crosststamp() unconditionally passes
    system_counterval.cycles to timekeeping_cycles_to_ns(). But when
    interpolating system time (do_interp == true), system_counterval.cycles is
    before tkr_mono.cycle_last, contrary to the timekeeping_cycles_to_ns()
    expectations.
    
    On x86, CONFIG_CLOCKSOURCE_VALIDATE_LAST_CYCLE will mitigate on
    interpolating, setting delta to 0. With delta == 0, xtstamp->sys_monoraw
    and xtstamp->sys_realtime are then set to the last update time, as
    implicitly expected by adjust_historical_crosststamp(). On other
    architectures, the resulting nonsense xtstamp->sys_monoraw and
    xtstamp->sys_realtime corrupt the xtstamp (ts) adjustment in
    adjust_historical_crosststamp().
    
    Fix this by deriving xtstamp->sys_monoraw and xtstamp->sys_realtime from
    the last update time when interpolating, by using the local variable
    "cycles". The local variable already has the right value when
    interpolating, unlike system_counterval.cycles.

    timekeeping: Fix cross-timestamp interpolation corner case decision
    
    [ Upstream commit 87a41130881995f82f7adbafbfeddaebfb35f0ef ]
    
    The cycle_between() helper checks if parameter test is in the open interval
    (before, after). Colloquially speaking, this also applies to the counter
    wrap-around special case before > after. get_device_system_crosststamp()
    currently uses cycle_between() at the first call site to decide whether to
    interpolate for older counter readings.
    
    get_device_system_crosststamp() has the following problem with
    cycle_between() testing against an open interval: Assume that, by chance,
    cycles == tk->tkr_mono.cycle_last (in the following, "cycle_last" for
    brevity). Then, cycle_between() at the first call site, with effective
    argument values cycle_between(cycle_last, cycles, now), returns false,
    enabling interpolation. During interpolation,
    get_device_system_crosststamp() will then call cycle_between() at the
    second call site (if a history_begin was supplied). The effective argument
    values are cycle_between(history_begin->cycles, cycles, cycles), since
    system_counterval.cycles == interval_start == cycles, per the assumption.
    Due to the test against the open interval, cycle_between() returns false
    again. This causes get_device_system_crosststamp() to return -EINVAL.
    
    This failure should be avoided, since get_device_system_crosststamp() works
    both when cycles follows cycle_last (no interpolation), and when cycles
    precedes cycle_last (interpolation). For the case cycles == cycle_last,
    interpolation is actually unneeded.
    
    Fix this by changing cycle_between() into timestamp_in_interval(), which
    now checks against the closed interval, rather than the open interval.
    
    This changes the get_device_system_crosststamp() behavior for three corner
    cases:
    
    1. Bypass interpolation in the case cycles == tk->tkr_mono.cycle_last,
       fixing the problem described above.
    
    2. At the first timestamp_in_interval() call site, cycles == now no longer
       causes failure.
    
    3. At the second timestamp_in_interval() call site, history_begin->cycles
       == system_counterval.cycles no longer causes failure.
       adjust_historical_crosststamp() also works for this corner case,
       where partial_history_cycles == total_history_cycles.
    
    These behavioral changes should not cause any problems.

    x86/sme: Fix memory encryption setting if enabled by default and not overridden

      cbebd68f59f0 ("x86/mm: Fix use of uninitialized buffer in sme_enable()")
    
    'fixed' an issue in sme_enable() detected by static analysis, and broke
    the common case in the process.
    
    cmdline_find_option() will return < 0 on an error, or when the command
    line argument does not appear at all. In this particular case, the
    latter is not an error condition, and so the early exit is wrong.
    
    Instead, without mem_encrypt= on the command line, the compile time
    default should be honoured, which could be to enable memory encryption,
    and this is currently broken.
    
    Fix it by setting sme_me_mask to a preliminary value based on the
    compile time default, and only omitting the command line argument test
    when cmdline_find_option() returns an error.

    x86/resctrl: Implement new mba_MBps throttling heuristic
    
    [ Upstream commit c2427e70c1630d98966375fffc2b713ab9768a94 ]
    
    The mba_MBps feedback loop increases throttling when a group is using
    more bandwidth than the target set by the user in the schemata file, and
    decreases throttling when below target.
    
    To avoid possibly stepping throttling up and down on every poll a flag
    "delta_comp" is set whenever throttling is changed to indicate that the
    actual change in bandwidth should be recorded on the next poll in
    "delta_bw". Throttling is only reduced if the current bandwidth plus
    delta_bw is below the user target.
    
    This algorithm works well if the workload has steady bandwidth needs.
    But it can go badly wrong if the workload moves to a different phase
    just as the throttling level changed. E.g. if the workload becomes
    essentially idle right as throttling level is increased, the value
    calculated for delta_bw will be more or less the old bandwidth level.
    If the workload then resumes, Linux may never reduce throttling because
    current bandwidth plus delta_bw is above the target set by the user.
    
    Implement a simpler heuristic by assuming that in the worst case the
    currently measured bandwidth is being controlled by the current level of
    throttling. Compute how much it may increase if throttling is relaxed to
    the next higher level. If that is still below the user target, then it
    is ok to reduce the amount of throttling.

    aoe: fix the potential use-after-free problem in aoecmd_cfg_pkts
    
    [ Upstream commit f98364e926626c678fb4b9004b75cacf92ff0662 ]
    
    This patch is against CVE-2023-6270. The description of cve is:
    
      A flaw was found in the ATA over Ethernet (AoE) driver in the Linux
      kernel. The aoecmd_cfg_pkts() function improperly updates the refcnt on
      `struct net_device`, and a use-after-free can be triggered by racing
      between the free on the struct and the access through the `skbtxq`
      global queue. This could lead to a denial of service condition or
      potential code execution.
    
    In aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), it always calls dev_put(ifp) when skb initial
    code is finished. But the net_device ifp will still be used in
    later tx()->dev_queue_xmit() in kthread. Which means that the
    dev_put(ifp) should NOT be called in the success path of skb
    initial code in aoecmd_cfg_pkts(). Otherwise tx() may run into
    use-after-free because the net_device is freed.
    
    This patch removed the dev_put(ifp) in the success path in
    aoecmd_cfg_pkts(), and added dev_put() after skb xmit in tx().

    io_uring/net: fix overflow check in io_recvmsg_mshot_prep()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8ede3db5061bb1fe28e2c9683329aafa89d2b1b4 ]
    
    The "controllen" variable is type size_t (unsigned long).  Casting it
    to int could lead to an integer underflow.
    
    The check_add_overflow() function considers the type of the destination
    which is type int.  If we add two positive values and the result cannot
    fit in an integer then that's counted as an overflow.
    
    However, if we cast "controllen" to an int and it turns negative, then
    negative values *can* fit into an int type so there is no overflow.
    
    Good: 100 + (unsigned long)-4 = 96  <-- overflow
     Bad: 100 + (int)-4 = 96 <-- no overflow
    
    I deleted the cast of the sizeof() as well.  That's not a bug but the
    cast is unnecessary.

    fs/select: rework stack allocation hack for clang
    
    [ Upstream commit ddb9fd7a544088ed70eccbb9f85e9cc9952131c1 ]
    
    A while ago, we changed the way that select() and poll() preallocate
    a temporary buffer just under the size of the static warning limit of
    1024 bytes, as clang was frequently going slightly above that limit.
    
    The warnings have recently returned and I took another look. As it turns
    out, clang is not actually inherently worse at reserving stack space,
    it just happens to inline do_select() into core_sys_select(), while gcc
    never inlines it.
    
    Annotate do_select() to never be inlined and in turn remove the special
    case for the allocation size. This should give the same behavior for
    both clang and gcc all the time and once more avoids those warnings.

    Under CONFIG_RCU_EXP_KTHREAD=y, the nodes initialization for expedited
    grace periods is queued to a kworker. However if the allocation of that
    kworker failed, the nodes initialization is performed synchronously by
    the caller instead.
    
    Now the check for kworker initialization failure relies on the kworker
    pointer to be NULL while its value might actually encapsulate an
    allocation failure error.

    [ Upstream commit 79ae56fc475869d636071f66d9e4ef2a3819eee6 ]
    
    All log messages in dasd.c use the printk variants of pr_*(). They all
    add the name of the affected device manually to the log message.
    This can be simplified by using the dev_*() variants of printk, which
    include the device information and make a separate call to dev_name()
    unnecessary.
    
    The KMSG_COMPONENT and the pr_fmt() definition can be dropped. Note that
    this removes the "dasd: " prefix from the one pr_info() call in
    dasd_init(). However, the log message already provides all relevant
    information.

    firewire: core: use long bus reset on gap count error
    
    [ Upstream commit d0b06dc48fb15902d7da09c5c0861e7f042a9381 ]
    
    When resetting the bus after a gap count error, use a long rather than
    short bus reset.
    
    IEEE 1394-1995 uses only long bus resets. IEEE 1394a adds the option of
    short bus resets. When video or audio transmission is in progress and a
    device is hot-plugged elsewhere on the bus, the resulting bus reset can
    cause video frame drops or audio dropouts. Short bus resets reduce or
    eliminate this problem. Accordingly, short bus resets are almost always
    preferred.
    
    However, on a mixed 1394/1394a bus, a short bus reset can trigger an
    immediate additional bus reset. This double bus reset can be interpreted
    differently by different nodes on the bus, resulting in an inconsistent gap
    count after the bus reset. An inconsistent gap count will cause another bus
    reset, leading to a neverending bus reset loop. This only happens for some
    bus topologies, not for all mixed 1394/1394a buses.
    
    By instead sending a long bus reset after a gap count inconsistency, we
    avoid the doubled bus reset, restoring the bus to normal operation.

    Bluetooth: rfcomm: Fix null-ptr-deref in rfcomm_check_security
    
    [ Upstream commit 2535b848fa0f42ddff3e5255cf5e742c9b77bb26 ]
    
    During our fuzz testing of the connection and disconnection process at the
    RFCOMM layer, we discovered this bug. By comparing the packets from a
    normal connection and disconnection process with the testcase that
    triggered a KASAN report. We analyzed the cause of this bug as follows:
    
    1. In the packets captured during a normal connection, the host sends a
    `Read Encryption Key Size` type of `HCI_CMD` packet
    (Command Opcode: 0x1408) to the controller to inquire the length of
    encryption key.After receiving this packet, the controller immediately
    replies with a Command Completepacket (Event Code: 0x0e) to return the
    Encryption Key Size.
    
    2. In our fuzz test case, the timing of the controller's response to this
    packet was delayed to an unexpected point: after the RFCOMM and L2CAP
    layers had disconnected but before the HCI layer had disconnected.
    
    3. After receiving the Encryption Key Size Response at the time described
    in point 2, the host still called the rfcomm_check_security function.
    However, by this time `struct l2cap_conn *conn = l2cap_pi(sk)->chan->conn;`
    had already been released, and when the function executed
    `return hci_conn_security(conn->hcon, d->sec_level, auth_type, d->out);`,
    specifically when accessing `conn->hcon`, a null-ptr-deref error occurred.
    
    To fix this bug, check if `sk->sk_state` is BT_CLOSED before calling
    rfcomm_recv_frame in rfcomm_process_rx.

    If the driver detects that the controller is not ready before sending the

    btrfs: fix data races when accessing the reserved amount of block reserves
    
    [ Upstream commit e06cc89475eddc1f3a7a4d471524256152c68166 ]
    
    At space_info.c we have several places where we access the ->reserved
    field of a block reserve without taking the block reserve's spinlock
    first, which makes KCSAN warn about a data race since that field is
    always updated while holding the spinlock.
    
    The reports from KCSAN are like the following:

    dm-verity, dm-crypt: align "struct bvec_iter" correctly
    
    [ Upstream commit 787f1b2800464aa277236a66eb3c279535edd460 ]
    
    "struct bvec_iter" is defined with the __packed attribute, so it is
    aligned on a single byte. On X86 (and on other architectures that support
    unaligned addresses in hardware), "struct bvec_iter" is accessed using the
    8-byte and 4-byte memory instructions, however these instructions are less
    efficient if they operate on unaligned addresses.
    
    (on RISC machines that don't have unaligned access in hardware, GCC
    generates byte-by-byte accesses that are very inefficient - see [1])
    
    This commit reorders the entries in "struct dm_verity_io" and "struct
    convert_context", so that "struct bvec_iter" is aligned on 8 bytes.

    [ Upstream commit 5429c8de56f6b2bd8f537df3a1e04e67b9c04282 ]
    
    The SED Opal response parsing function response_parse() does not
    handle the case of an empty atom in the response. This causes
    the entry count to be too high and the response fails to be
    parsed. Recognizing, but ignoring, empty atoms allows response
    handling to succeed.

    x86/mm: Disallow vsyscall page read for copy_from_kernel_nofault()
    
    [ Upstream commit 32019c659ecfe1d92e3bf9fcdfbb11a7c70acd58 ]
    
    When trying to use copy_from_kernel_nofault() to read vsyscall page
    through a bpf program, the following oops was reported:
    
      BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffffffff600000

      ---[ end trace 0000000000000000 ]---
    
    The oops is triggered when:
    
    1) A bpf program uses bpf_probe_read_kernel() to read from the vsyscall
    page and invokes copy_from_kernel_nofault() which in turn calls
    __get_user_asm().
    
    2) Because the vsyscall page address is not readable from kernel space,
    a page fault exception is triggered accordingly.
    
    3) handle_page_fault() considers the vsyscall page address as a user
    space address instead of a kernel space address. This results in the
    fix-up setup by bpf not being applied and a page_fault_oops() is invoked
    due to SMAP.
    
    Considering handle_page_fault() has already considered the vsyscall page
    address as a userspace address, fix the problem by disallowing vsyscall
    page read for copy_from_kernel_nofault().

    RDMA/mlx5: Relax DEVX access upon modify commands
    
    [ Upstream commit be551ee1574280ef8afbf7c271212ac3e38933ef ]
    
    Relax DEVX access upon modify commands to be UVERBS_ACCESS_READ.
    
    The kernel doesn't need to protect what firmware protects, or what
    causes no damage to anyone but the user.
    
    As firmware needs to protect itself from parallel access to the same
    object, don't block parallel modify/query commands on the same object in
    the kernel side.
    
    This change will allow user space application to run parallel updates to
    different entries in the same bulk object.

    arm64/sve: Lower the maximum allocation for the SVE ptrace regset
    
    [ Upstream commit 2813926261e436d33bc74486b51cce60b76edf78 ]
    
    Doug Anderson observed that ChromeOS crashes are being reported which
    include failing allocations of order 7 during core dumps due to ptrace
    allocating storage for regsets:
    
      chrome: page allocation failure: order:7,
              mode:0x40dc0(GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_COMP|__GFP_ZERO),
              nodemask=(null),cpuset=urgent,mems_allowed=0
       ...
      regset_get_alloc+0x1c/0x28
      elf_core_dump+0x3d8/0xd8c
      do_coredump+0xeb8/0x1378
    
    with further investigation showing that this is:
    
       [   66.957385] DOUG: Allocating 279584 bytes
    
    which is the maximum size of the SVE regset. As Doug observes it is not
    entirely surprising that such a large allocation of contiguous memory might
    fail on a long running system.
    
    The SVE regset is currently sized to hold SVE registers with a VQ of
    SVE_VQ_MAX which is 512, substantially more than the architectural maximum
    of 16 which we might see even in a system emulating the limits of the
    architecture. Since we don't expose the size we tell the regset core
    externally let's define ARCH_SVE_VQ_MAX with the actual architectural
    maximum and use that for the regset, we'll still overallocate most of the
    time but much less so which will be helpful even if the core is fixed to
    not require contiguous allocations.
    
    Specify ARCH_SVE_VQ_MAX in terms of the maximum value that can be written
    into ZCR_ELx.LEN (where this is set in the hardware). For consistency
    update the maximum SME vector length to be specified in the same style
    while we are at it.
    
    We could also teach the ptrace core about runtime discoverable regset sizes
    but that would be a more invasive change and this is being observed in
    practical systems.

    ASoC: rt5645: Make LattePanda board DMI match more precise
    
    [ Upstream commit 551539a8606e28cb2a130f8ef3e9834235b456c4 ]
    
    The DMI strings used for the LattePanda board DMI quirks are very generic.
    
    Using the dmidecode database from https://linux-hardware.org/ shows
    that the chosen DMI strings also match the following 2 laptops
    which also have a rt5645 codec:
    
    Insignia NS-P11W7100 https://linux-hardware.org/?computer=E092FFF8BA04
    Insignia NS-P10W8100 https://linux-hardware.org/?computer=AFB6C0BF7934
    
    All 4 hw revisions of the LattePanda board have "S70CR" in their BIOS
    version DMI strings:
    
    DF-BI-7-S70CR100-*
    DF-BI-7-S70CR110-*
    DF-BI-7-S70CR200-*
    LP-BS-7-S70CR700-*
    
    See e.g. https://linux-hardware.org/?computer=D98250A817C0
    
    Add a partial (non exact) DMI match on this string to make the LattePanda
    board DMI match more precise to avoid false-positive matches.

    [ Upstream commit 50572064ec7109b00eef8880e905f55861c8b3de ]
    
    AmpereOneX mesh implementation has a bug in HN-P nodes that makes them
    report incorrect child count. The failing crosspoints report 8 children
    while they only have two.
    
    When the driver tries to access the inexistent child nodes, it believes it
    has reached an invalid node type and probing fails. The workaround is to
    ignore those incorrect child nodes and continue normally.

    media: rkisp1: Fix IRQ handling due to shared interrupts
    
    [ Upstream commit ffb635bb398fc07cb38f8a7b4a82cbe5f412f08e ]
    
    The driver requests the interrupts as IRQF_SHARED, so the interrupt
    handlers can be called at any time. If such a call happens while the ISP
    is powered down, the SoC will hang as the driver tries to access the
    ISP registers.
    
    This can be reproduced even without the platform sharing the IRQ line:
    Enable CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ and unload the driver, and the board will
    hang.
    
    Fix this by adding a new field, 'irqs_enabled', which is used to bail
    out from the interrupt handler when the ISP is not operational.

    nfsd: Fix creation time serialization order
    
    In nfsd4_encode_fattr(), TIME_CREATE was being written out after all
    other times.  However, they should be written out in an order that
    matches the bit flags in bmval1, which in this case are
    
        #define FATTR4_WORD1_TIME_ACCESS        (1UL << 15)
        #define FATTR4_WORD1_TIME_CREATE        (1UL << 18)
        #define FATTR4_WORD1_TIME_DELTA         (1UL << 19)
        #define FATTR4_WORD1_TIME_METADATA      (1UL << 20)
        #define FATTR4_WORD1_TIME_MODIFY        (1UL << 21)
    
    so TIME_CREATE should come second.
    
    I noticed this on a FreeBSD NFSv4.2 client, which supports creation
    times.  On this client, file times were weirdly permuted.  With this
    patch applied on the server, times looked normal on the client.

    NFSD: Convert filecache to rhltable
    
    [ Upstream commit c4c649ab413ba6a785b25f0edbb12f617c87db2a ]
    
    While we were converting the nfs4_file hashtable to use the kernel's
    resizable hashtable data structure, Neil Brown observed that the
    list variant (rhltable) would be better for managing nfsd_file items
    as well. The nfsd_file hash table will contain multiple entries for
    the same inode -- these should be kept together on a list. And, it
    could be possible for exotic or malicious client behavior to cause
    the hash table to resize itself on every insertion.
    
    A nice simplification is that rhltable_lookup() can return a list
    that contains only nfsd_file items that match a given inode, which
    enables us to eliminate specialized hash table helper functions and
    use the default functions provided by the rhashtable implementation).
    
    Since we are now storing nfsd_file items for the same inode on a
    single list, that effectively reduces the number of hash entries
    that have to be tracked in the hash table. The mininum bucket count
    is therefore lowered.
    
    Light testing with fstests generic/531 show no regressions.

    nfsd: allow reaping files still under writeback
    
    [ Upstream commit dcb779fcd4ed5984ad15991d574943d12a8693d1 ]
    
    On most filesystems, there is no reason to delay reaping an nfsd_file
    just because its underlying inode is still under writeback. nfsd just
    relies on client activity or the local flusher threads to do writeback.
    
    The main exception is NFS, which flushes all of its dirty data on last
    close. Add a new EXPORT_OP_FLUSH_ON_CLOSE flag to allow filesystems to
    signal that they do this, and only skip closing files under writeback on
    such filesystems.
    
    Also, remove a redundant NULL file pointer check in
    nfsd_file_check_writeback, and clean up nfs's export op flag
    definitions.

    Currently, there is no limit for raid1/raid10 plugged bio. While flushing
    writes, raid1 has cond_resched() while raid10 doesn't, and too many
    writes can cause soft lockup.
    
    Follow up soft lockup can be triggered easily with writeback test for
    raid10 with ramdisks:

    Fix the problem by adding cond_resched() to raid10 like what raid1 did.
    
    Note that unlimited plugged bio still need to be optimized, for example,
    in the case of lots of dirty pages writeback, this will take lots of
    memory and io will spend a long time in plug, hence io latency is bad.
