    HID: wacom: Force pen out of prox if no events have been received in a while
    
    commit 94b179052f95c294d83e9c9c34f7833cf3cd4305 upstream.
    
    Prox-out events may not be reliably sent by some AES firmware. This can
    cause problems for users, particularly due to arbitration logic disabling
    touch input while the pen is in prox.
    
    This commit adds a timer which is reset every time a new prox event is
    received. When the timer expires we check to see if the pen is still in
    prox and force it out if necessary. This is patterend off of the same
    solution used by 'hid-letsketch' driver which has a similar problem.

    s390/qdio: fix do_sqbs() inline assembly constraint
    
    commit 2862a2fdfae875888e3c1c3634e3422e01d98147 upstream.
    
    Use "a" constraint instead of "d" constraint to pass the state parameter to
    the do_sqbs() inline assembly. This prevents that general purpose register
    zero is used for the state parameter.
    
    If the compiler would select general purpose register zero this would be
    problematic for the used instruction in rsy format: the register used for
    the state parameter is a base register. If the base register is general
    purpose register zero the contents of the register are unexpectedly ignored
    when the instruction is executed.
    
    This only applies to z/VM guests using QIOASSIST with dedicated (pass through)
    QDIO-based devices such as FCP [zfcp driver] as well as real OSA or
    HiperSockets [qeth driver].
    
    A possible symptom for this case using zfcp is the following repeating kernel
    message pattern:
    
    zfcp <devbusid>: A QDIO problem occurred
    zfcp <devbusid>: A QDIO problem occurred
    zfcp <devbusid>: qdio: ZFCP on SC <sc> using AI:1 QEBSM:1 PRI:1 TDD:1 SIGA: W
    zfcp <devbusid>: A QDIO problem occurred
    zfcp <devbusid>: A QDIO problem occurred
    
    Each of the qdio problem message can be accompanied by the following entries
    for the affected subchannel <sc> in
    /sys/kernel/debug/s390dbf/qdio_error/hex_ascii for zfcp or qeth:
    
    <sc> ccq: 69....

    nilfs2: fix use-after-free bug of nilfs_root in nilfs_evict_inode()
    
    commit 9b5a04ac3ad9898c4745cba46ea26de74ba56a8e upstream.
    
    During unmount process of nilfs2, nothing holds nilfs_root structure after
    nilfs2 detaches its writer in nilfs_detach_log_writer().  However, since
    nilfs_evict_inode() uses nilfs_root for some cleanup operations, it may
    cause use-after-free read if inodes are left in "garbage_list" and
    released by nilfs_dispose_list() at the end of nilfs_detach_log_writer().
    
    Fix this issue by modifying nilfs_evict_inode() to only clear inode
    without additional metadata changes that use nilfs_root if the file system
    is degraded to read-only or the writer is detached.

    powerpc/64s/radix: Fix soft dirty tracking
    
    commit 66b2ca086210732954a7790d63d35542936fc664 upstream.
    
    It was reported that soft dirty tracking doesn't work when using the
    Radix MMU.
    
    The tracking is supposed to work by clearing the soft dirty bit for a
    mapping and then write protecting the PTE. If/when the page is written
    to, a page fault occurs and the soft dirty bit is added back via
    pte_mkdirty(). For example in wp_page_reuse():
    
            entry = maybe_mkwrite(pte_mkdirty(entry), vma);
            if (ptep_set_access_flags(vma, vmf->address, vmf->pte, entry, 1))
                    update_mmu_cache(vma, vmf->address, vmf->pte);
    
    Unfortunately on radix _PAGE_SOFTDIRTY is being dropped by
    radix__ptep_set_access_flags(), called from ptep_set_access_flags(),
    meaning the soft dirty bit is not set even though the page has been
    written to.
    
    Fix it by adding _PAGE_SOFTDIRTY to the set of bits that are able to be
    changed in radix__ptep_set_access_flags().

    powerpc/iommu: Incorrect DDW Table is referenced for SR-IOV device
    
    commit 1f7aacc5eb9ed2cc17be7a90da5cd559effb9d59 upstream.
    
    For an SR-IOV device, while enabling DDW, a new table is created and
    added at index 1 in the group. In the below 2 scenarios, the table is
    incorrectly referenced at index 0 (which is where the table is for
    default DMA window).
    
    1. When adding DDW
    
       This issue is exposed with "slub_debug". Error thrown out from
       dma_iommu_dma_supported()
    
       Warning: IOMMU offset too big for device mask
       mask: 0xffffffff, table offset: 0x800000000000000
    
    2. During Dynamic removal of the PCI device.
    
       Error is from iommu_tce_table_put() since a NULL table pointer is
       passed in.

    vc_screen: reload load of struct vc_data pointer in vcs_write() to avoid UAF
    
    commit 8fb9ea65c9d1338b0d2bb0a9122dc942cdd32357 upstream.
    
    After a call to console_unlock() in vcs_write() the vc_data struct can be
    freed by vc_port_destruct(). Because of that, the struct vc_data pointer
    must be reloaded in the while loop in vcs_write() after console_lock() to
    avoid a UAF when vcs_size() is called.
    
    Syzkaller reported a UAF in vcs_size().

    Adding UART port triggers probe of child serial devices - serdev and
    eventually Qualcomm Bluetooth hci_qca driver.  This opens UART port
    which enables the interrupt before it got activated in

    ("tty: serial: qcom_geni_serial: Wakeup IRQ cleanup") and discussion on

    uart_add_one_port() is moved above requesting interrupt.

    serial: 8250_exar: Add support for USR298x PCI Modems
    
    commit 95d698869b404772cc8b72560df71548491c10bc upstream.
    
    Possibly the last PCI controller-based (i.e. not a soft/winmodem)
    dial-up modem one can still buy.
    
    Looks to have a stock XR17C154 PCI UART chip for communication, but for
    some reason when provisioning the PCI IDs they swapped the vendor and
    subvendor IDs. Otherwise this card would have worked out of the box.
    
    Searching online, some folks seem to not have this issue and others do,
    so it is possible only some batches of cards have this error.
    
    Create a new macro to handle the switched IDs and add support here.

    commit d2b00516de0e1d696724247098f6733a6ea53908 upstream.

    Advantech provides opensource drivers for this and many others card

    It is hard to maintain to run as out of tree module on newer kernels.
    Just adding PCI ID to kernel 8250_pci works perfect.

    SMB3: drop reference to cfile before sending oplock break
    
    commit 59a556aebc43dded08535fe97d94ca3f657915e4 upstream.
    
    In cifs_oplock_break function we drop reference to a cfile at
    the end of function, due to which close command goes on wire
    after lease break acknowledgment even if file is already closed
    by application but we had deferred the handle close.
    If other client with limited file shareaccess waiting on lease
    break ack proceeds operation on that file as soon as first client
    sends ack, then we may encounter status sharing violation error
    because of open handle.
    Solution is to put reference to cfile(send close on wire if last ref)
    and then send oplock acknowledgment to server.

    SMB3: Close all deferred handles of inode in case of handle lease break
    
    commit 47592fa8eb03742048b096b4696ec133384c45eb upstream.
    
    Oplock break may occur for different file handle than the deferred
    handle. Check for inode deferred closes list, if it's not empty then
    close all the deferred handles of inode because we should not cache
    handles if we dont have handle lease.
    
    Eg: If openfilelist has one deferred file handle and another open file
    handle from app for a same file, then on a lease break we choose the
    first handle in openfile list. The first handle in list can be deferred
    handle or actual open file handle from app. In case if it is actual open
    handle then today, we don't close deferred handles if we lose handle lease
    on a file. Problem with this is, later if app decides to close the existing
    open handle then we still be caching deferred handles until deferred close
    timeout. Leaving open handle may result in sharing violation when windows
    client tries to open a file with limited file share access.
    
    So we should check for deferred list of inode and walk through the list of
    deferred files in inode and close all deferred files.

    commit 262d7a52ba27525e3c1203230c9f0524e48bbb34 upstream.
    
    Under certain circumstances we send two EFLUSH commands, resulting in two
    EFLUSH ack packets, while only expecting a single EFLUSH ack.
    This can cause the driver Tx flush completion to get out of sync.
    
    To avoid this problem, don't enable the "Transmit buffer flush done" (TFD)
    interrupt and remove the code handling it.
    Now we only send EFLUSH command after receiving status packet with
    "Init detected" (IDET) bit set.

    xhci: Fix incorrect tracking of free space on transfer rings
    
    commit fe82f16aafdaf8002281d3b9524291d4a4a28460 upstream.
    
    This incorrect tracking caused unnecessary ring expansion in some
    usecases which over days of use consume a lot of memory.
    
    xhci driver tries to keep track of free transfer blocks (TRBs) on the
    ring buffer, but failed to add back some cancelled transfers that were
    turned into no-op operations instead of just moving past them.
    
    This can happen if there are several queued pending transfers which
    then are cancelled in reverse order.
    
    Solve this by counting the numer of steps we move the dequeue pointer
    once we complete a transfer, and add it to the number of free trbs
    instead of just adding the trb number of the current transfer.
    This way we ensure we count the no-op trbs on the way as well.

    usb: gadget: u_ether: Fix host MAC address case
    
    commit 3c0f4f09c063e143822393d99cb2b19a85451c07 upstream.
    
    The CDC-ECM specification [1] requires to send the host MAC address as
    an uppercase hexadecimal string in chapter "5.4 Ethernet Networking
    Functional Descriptor":
        The Unicode character is chosen from the set of values 30h through
        39h and 41h through 46h (0-9 and A-F).
    
    However, snprintf(.., "%pm", ..) generates a lowercase MAC address
    string. While most host drivers are tolerant to this, UsbNcm.sys on
    Windows 10 is not. Instead it uses a different MAC address with all
    bytes set to zero including and after the first byte containing a
    lowercase letter. On Windows 11 Microsoft fixed it, but apparently they
    did not backport the fix.
    
    This change fixes the issue by upper-casing the MAC to comply with the
    specification.

    usb: dwc3: debugfs: Resume dwc3 before accessing registers
    
    commit 614ce6a2ea50068b45339257891e51e639ac9001 upstream.
    
    When the dwc3 device is runtime suspended, various required clocks are in
    disabled state and it is not guaranteed that access to any registers would
    work. Depending on the SoC glue, a register read could be as benign as
    returning 0 or be fatal enough to hang the system.
    
    In order to prevent such scenarios of fatal errors, make sure to resume
    dwc3 then allow the function to proceed.

    usb-storage: fix deadlock when a scsi command timeouts more than once
    
    commit a398d5eac6984316e71474e25b975688f282379b upstream.
    
    With faulty usb-storage devices, read/write can timeout, in that case
    the SCSI layer will abort and re-issue the command. USB storage has no
    internal timeout, it relies on SCSI layer aborting commands via
    .eh_abort_handler() for non those responsive devices.
    
    After two consecutive timeouts of the same command, SCSI layer calls
    .eh_device_reset_handler(), without calling .eh_abort_handler() first.
    
    With usb-storage, this causes a deadlock:
    
      -> .eh_device_reset_handler
        -> device_reset
          -> mutex_lock(&(us->dev_mutex));
    
    mutex already by usb_stor_control_thread(), which is waiting for
    command completion:
    
      -> usb_stor_control_thread (mutex taken here)
        -> usb_stor_invoke_transport
          -> usb_stor_Bulk_transport
            -> usb_stor_bulk_srb
              -> usb_stor_bulk_transfer_sglist
                -> usb_sg_wait
    
    Make sure we cancel any pending command in .eh_device_reset_handler()
    to avoid this.

    commit 359b4315471181f108723c61612d96e383e56179 upstream.
    
    Line6 Pod Go (0e41:424b) requires the similar workaround for the fixed
    48k sample rate like other Line6 models.  This patch adds the
    corresponding entry to line6_parse_audio_format_rate_quirk().

    bridge: always declare tunnel functions
    
    [ Upstream commit 89dcd87ce534a3a7f267cfd58505803006f51301 ]
    
    When CONFIG_BRIDGE_VLAN_FILTERING is disabled, two functions are still
    defined but have no prototype or caller. This causes a W=1 warning for
    the missing prototypes:
    
    net/bridge/br_netlink_tunnel.c:29:6: error: no previous prototype for 'vlan_tunid_inrange' [-Werror=missing-prototypes]
    net/bridge/br_netlink_tunnel.c:199:5: error: no previous prototype for 'br_vlan_tunnel_info' [-Werror=missing-prototypes]
    
    The functions are already contitional on CONFIG_BRIDGE_VLAN_FILTERING,
    and I coulnd't easily figure out the right set of #ifdefs, so just
    move the declarations out of the #ifdef to avoid the warning,
    at a small cost in code size over a more elaborate fix.

    vlan: fix a potential uninit-value in vlan_dev_hard_start_xmit()
    
    [ Upstream commit dacab578c7c6cd06c50c89dfa36b0e0f10decd4e ]
    
    syzbot triggered the following splat [1], sending an empty message
    through pppoe_sendmsg().
    
    When VLAN_FLAG_REORDER_HDR flag is set, vlan_dev_hard_header()
    does not push extra bytes for the VLAN header, because vlan is offloaded.
    
    Unfortunately vlan_dev_hard_start_xmit() first reads veth->h_vlan_proto
    before testing (vlan->flags & VLAN_FLAG_REORDER_HDR).
    
    We need to swap the two conditions.

    scsi: storvsc: Don't pass unused PFNs to Hyper-V host
    
    [ Upstream commit 4e81a6cba517cb33584308a331f14f5e3fec369b ]
    
    In a SCSI request, storvsc pre-allocates space for up to
    MAX_PAGE_BUFFER_COUNT physical frame numbers to be passed to Hyper-V.  If
    the size of the I/O request requires more PFNs, a separate memory area of
    exactly the correct size is dynamically allocated.
    
    But when the pre-allocated area is used, current code always passes
    MAX_PAGE_BUFFER_COUNT PFNs to Hyper-V, even if fewer are needed.  While
    this doesn't break anything because the additional PFNs are always zero,
    more bytes than necessary are copied into the VMBus channel ring buffer.
    This takes CPU cycles and wastes space in the ring buffer. For a typical 4
    Kbyte I/O that requires only a single PFN, 248 unnecessary bytes are
    copied.
    
    Fix this by setting the payload_sz based on the actual number of PFNs
    required, not the size of the pre-allocated space.

    [ Upstream commit 682b6dc29d98e857e6ca4bbc077c7dc2899b7473 ]
    
    If the firmware sends us a corrupted MCC response with
    n_channels much larger than the command response can be,
    we might copy far too much (uninitialized) memory and

    run out of the one page allocated for the FW response.

    [ Upstream commit 93e0401e0fc0c54b0ac05b687cd135c2ac38187c ]
    
    The call to phy_stop() races with the later call to phy_disconnect(),
    resulting in concurrent phy_suspend() calls being run from different
    CPUs. The final call to phy_disconnect() ensures that the PHY is
    stopped and suspended, too.

    s390/cio: include subchannels without devices also for evaluation
    
    [ Upstream commit b1b0d5aec1cf9f9a900a14964f869c68688d923e ]
    
    Currently when the new channel-path is enabled, we do evaluation only
    on the subchannels with a device connected on it. This is because,
    in the past, if the device in the subchannel is not working or not
    available, we used to unregister the subchannels. But, from the 'commit
    2297791c92d0 ("s390/cio: dont unregister subchannel from child-drivers")'
    we allow subchannels with or without an active device connected
    on it. So, when we do the io_subchannel_verify, make sure that,
    we are evaluating the subchannels without any device too.

    tipc: check the bearer min mtu properly when setting it by netlink
    
    [ Upstream commit 35a089b5d793d2bfd2cc7cfa6104545184de2ce7 ]
    
    Checking the bearer min mtu with tipc_udp_mtu_bad() only works for
    IPv4 UDP bearer, and IPv6 UDP bearer has a different value for the
    min mtu. This patch checks with encap_hlen + TIPC_MIN_BEARER_MTU
    for min mtu, which works for both IPv4 and IPv6 UDP bearer.
    
    Note that tipc_udp_mtu_bad() is still used to check media min mtu
    in __tipc_nl_media_set(), as m->mtu currently is only used by the
    IPv4 UDP bearer as its default mtu value.

    tipc: do not update mtu if msg_max is too small in mtu negotiation
    
    [ Upstream commit 56077b56cd3fb78e1c8619e29581ba25a5c55e86 ]
    
    When doing link mtu negotiation, a malicious peer may send Activate msg
    with a very small mtu, e.g. 4 in Shuang's testing, without checking for
    the minimum mtu, l->mtu will be set to 4 in tipc_link_proto_rcv(), then
    n->links[bearer_id].mtu is set to 4294967228, which is a overflow of
    '4 - INT_H_SIZE - EMSG_OVERHEAD' in tipc_link_mss().
    
    With tipc_link.mtu = 4, tipc_link_xmit() kept printing the warning:
    
     tipc: Too large msg, purging xmit list 1 5 0 40 4!
     tipc: Too large msg, purging xmit list 1 15 0 60 4!
    
    And with tipc_link_entry.mtu 4294967228, a huge skb was allocated in
    named_distribute(), and when purging it in tipc_link_xmit(), a crash
    was even caused:

    may hit an error causing net device open failed. However, previous

    expected behavior. Need to roll back the previous rq initialization
    to avoid leaks in error unwinding of init code.
    
    Also extract helper functions of disable and enable queue pairs.
    Use newly introduced disable helper function in error unwinding and
    virtnet_close. Use enable helper function in virtnet_open.

    SUNRPC: always free ctxt when freeing deferred request
    
    [ Upstream commit 948f072ada23e0a504c5e4d7d71d4c83bd0785ec ]
    
    Since the ->xprt_ctxt pointer was added to svc_deferred_req, it has not
    been sufficient to use kfree() to free a deferred request.  We may need
    to free the ctxt as well.
    
    As freeing the ctxt is all that ->xpo_release_rqst() does, we repurpose
    it to explicit do that even when the ctxt is not stored in an rqst.
    So we now have ->xpo_release_ctxt() which is given an xprt and a ctxt,
    which may have been taken either from an rqst or from a dreq.  The
    caller is now responsible for clearing that pointer after the call to
    ->xpo_release_ctxt.
    
    We also clear dr->xprt_ctxt when the ctxt is moved into a new rqst when
    revisiting a deferred request.  This ensures there is only one pointer
    to the ctxt, so the risk of double freeing in future is reduced.  The
    new code in svc_xprt_release which releases both the ctxt and any
    rq_deferred depends on this.

    Enable a struct sockaddr to be stored in a trace record as a
    dynamically-sized field. The common cases are AF_INET and AF_INET6
    which are different sizes, and are vastly smaller than a struct
    sockaddr_storage.
    
    These are safer because, when used properly, the size of the
    sockaddr destination field in each trace record is now guaranteed
    to be the same as the source address that is being copied into it.

    SUNRPC: double free xprt_ctxt while still in use
    
    [ Upstream commit eb8d3a2c809abd73ab0a060fe971d6b9019aa3c1 ]
    
    When an RPC request is deferred, the rq_xprt_ctxt pointer is moved out
    of the svc_rqst into the svc_deferred_req.
    When the deferred request is revisited, the pointer is copied into
    the new svc_rqst - and also remains in the svc_deferred_req.
    
    In the (rare?) case that the request is deferred a second time, the old
    svc_deferred_req is reused - it still has all the correct content.
    However in that case the rq_xprt_ctxt pointer is NOT cleared so that
    when xpo_release_xprt is called, the ctxt is freed (UDP) or possible
    added to a free list (RDMA).
    When the deferred request is revisited for a second time, it will
    reference this ctxt which may be invalid, and the free the object a
    second time which is likely to oops.
    
    So change svc_defer() to *always* clear rq_xprt_ctxt, and assert that
    the value is now stored in the svc_deferred_req.

    uses del_timer() to stop dma->timeout timer. But when timer
    handler netup_unidvb_dma_timeout() is running, del_timer()
    could not stop it. As a result, the use-after-free bug could
    happen. The process is shown below:
    
        (cleanup routine)          |        (timer routine)
                                   | mod_timer(&dev->tx_sim_timer, ..)
    netup_unidvb_finidev()         | (wait a time)
      netup_unidvb_dma_fini()      | netup_unidvb_dma_timeout()
        del_timer(&dma->timeout);  |
                                   |   ndev->pci_dev->dev //USE
    
    Fix by changing del_timer() to del_timer_sync().

    net: hns3: fix reset delay time to avoid configuration timeout
    
    [ Upstream commit 814d0c786068e858d889ada3153bff82f64223ad ]
    
    Currently the hns3 vf function reset delays 5000ms before vf rebuild
    process. In product applications, this delay is too long for application
    configurations and causes configuration timeout.
    
    According to the tests, 500ms delay is enough for reset process except PF
    FLR. So this patch modifies delay to 500ms in these scenarios.

    vsock: avoid to close connected socket after the timeout
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d4486efe9c69626cab423456169e250a5cd3af5 ]
    
    When client and server establish a connection through vsock,
    the client send a request to the server to initiate the connection,
    then start a timer to wait for the server's response. When the server's
    RESPONSE message arrives, the timer also times out and exits. The
    server's RESPONSE message is processed first, and the connection is
    established. However, the client's timer also times out, the original
    processing logic of the client is to directly set the state of this vsock
    to CLOSE and return ETIMEDOUT. It will not notify the server when the port
    is released, causing the server port remain.
    when client's vsock_connect timeout，it should check sk state is
    ESTABLISHED or not. if sk state is ESTABLISHED, it means the connection
    is established, the client should not set the sk state to CLOSE
    
    Note: I encountered this issue on kernel-4.18, which can be fixed by
    this patch. Then I checked the latest code in the community
    and found similar issue.

    [ Upstream commit 0b01db274028f5acd207332686ffc92ac77491ac ]
    
    Introduce the W/A for packet errors seen with short cables (<1m) between
    two DP83867 PHYs.
    
    The W/A recommended by DM requires FFE Equalizer Configuration tuning by
    writing value 0x0E81 to DSP_FFE_CFG register (0x012C), surrounded by hard
    and soft resets as follows:
    
    write_reg(0x001F, 0x8000); //hard reset
    write_reg(DSP_FFE_CFG, 0x0E81);
    write_reg(0x001F, 0x4000); //soft reset
    
    Since  DP83867 PHY DM says "Changing this register to 0x0E81, will not
    affect Long Cable performance.", enable the W/A by default.

    In the (unlikely) event that pm_runtime_get() (disguised as
    pm_runtime_resume_and_get()) fails, the remove callback returned an
    error early. The problem with this is that the driver core ignores the
    error value and continues removing the device. This results in a
    resource leak. Worse the devm allocated resources are freed and so if a
    callback of the driver is called later the register mapping is already
    gone which probably results in a crash.

    [ Upstream commit f97b8401e0deb46ad1e4245c21f651f64f55aaa6 ]
    
    On some distributions, the rp_filter is automatically set (=1) by
    default on a netdev basis (also on VRFs).
    In an SRv6 End.DT4 behavior, decapsulated IPv4 packets are routed using
    the table associated with the VRF bound to that tunnel. During lookup
    operations, the rp_filter can lead to packet loss when activated on the
    VRF.
    Therefore, we chose to make this selftest more robust by explicitly
    disabling the rp_filter during tests (as it is automatically set by some
    Linux distributions).

    selftests: seg6: disable DAD on IPv6 router cfg for srv6_end_dt4_l3vpn_test
    
    [ Upstream commit 21a933c79a33add3612808f3be4ad65dd4dc026b ]
    
    The srv6_end_dt4_l3vpn_test instantiates a virtual network consisting of
    several routers (rt-1, rt-2) and hosts.
    When the IPv6 addresses of rt-{1,2} routers are configured, the Deduplicate
    Address Detection (DAD) kicks in when enabled in the Linux distros running
    the selftests. DAD is used to check whether an IPv6 address is already
    assigned in a network. Such a mechanism consists of sending an ICMPv6 Echo
    Request and waiting for a reply.
    As the DAD process could take too long to complete, it may cause the
    failing of some tests carried out by the srv6_end_dt4_l3vpn_test script.
    
    To make the srv6_end_dt4_l3vpn_test more robust, we disable DAD on routers
    since we configure the virtual network manually and do not need any address
    deduplication mechanism at all.

    af_key: Reject optional tunnel/BEET mode templates in outbound policies
    
    [ Upstream commit cf3128a7aca55b2eefb68281d44749c683bdc96f ]
    
    xfrm_state_find() uses `encap_family` of the current template with
    the passed local and remote addresses to find a matching state.
    If an optional tunnel or BEET mode template is skipped in a mixed-family
    scenario, there could be a mismatch causing an out-of-bounds read as
    the addresses were not replaced to match the family of the next template.
    
    While there are theoretical use cases for optional templates in outbound
    policies, the only practical one is to skip IPComp states in inbound
    policies if uncompressed packets are received that are handled by an
    implicitly created IPIP state instead.

    cpupower: Make TSC read per CPU for Mperf monitor
    
    [ Upstream commit c2adb1877b76fc81ae041e1db1a6ed2078c6746b ]
    
    System-wide TSC read could cause a drift in C0 percentage calculation.
    Because if first TSC is read and then one by one mperf is read for all
    cpus, this introduces drift between mperf reading of later CPUs and TSC
    reading.  To lower this drift read TSC per CPU and also just after mperf
    read.  This technique improves C0 percentage calculation in Mperf monitor.

    drm/msm/dp: unregister audio driver during unbind
    
    [ Upstream commit 85c636284cb63b7740b4ae98881ace92158068d3 ]
    
    while binding the code always registers a audio driver, however there
    is no corresponding unregistration done in unbind. This leads to multiple
    redundant audio platform devices if dp_display_bind and dp_display_unbind
    happens multiple times during startup. On X13s platform this resulted in
    6 to 9 audio codec device instead of just 3 codec devices for 3 dp ports.
    
    Fix this by unregistering codecs on unbind.

    Revert "Fix XFRM-I support for nested ESP tunnels"
    
    [ Upstream commit 5fc46f94219d1d103ffb5f0832be9da674d85a73 ]
    
    This reverts commit b0355dbbf13c0052931dd14c38c789efed64d3de.
    
    The reverted commit clears the secpath on packets received via xfrm interfaces
    to support nested IPsec tunnels. This breaks Netfilter policy matching using
    xt_policy in the FORWARD chain, as the secpath is missing during forwarding.
    Additionally, Benedict Wong reports that it breaks Transport-in-Tunnel mode.
    
    Fix this regression by reverting the commit until we have a better approach
    for nested IPsec tunnels.

    xfrm: don't check the default policy if the policy allows the packet
    
    [ Upstream commit 430cac487400494c19a8b85299e979bb07b4671f ]
    
    The current code doesn't let a simple "allow" policy counteract a
    default policy blocking all incoming packets:
    
        ip x p setdefault in block
        ip x p a src 192.168.2.1/32 dst 192.168.2.2/32 dir in action allow
    
    At this stage, we have an allow policy (with or without transforms)
    for this packet. It doesn't matter what the default policy says, since
    the policy we looked up lets the packet through. The case of a
    blocking policy is already handled separately, so we can remove this
    check.

    parisc: Replace regular spinlock with spin_trylock on panic path
    
    [ Upstream commit 829632dae8321787525ee37dc4828bbe6edafdae ]
    
    The panic notifiers' callbacks execute in an atomic context, with
    interrupts/preemption disabled, and all CPUs not running the panic
    function are off, so it's very dangerous to wait on a regular
    spinlock, there's a risk of deadlock.
    
    Refactor the panic notifier of parisc/power driver to make use
    of spin_trylock - for that, we've added a second version of the
    soft-power function. Also, some comments were reorganized and
    trailing white spaces, useless header inclusion and blank lines

    mfd: dln2: Fix memory leak in dln2_probe()
    
    [ Upstream commit 96da8f148396329ba769246cb8ceaa35f1ddfc48 ]
    
    When dln2_setup_rx_urbs() in dln2_probe() fails, error out_free forgets
    to call usb_put_dev() to decrease the refcount of dln2->usb_dev.
    
    Fix this by adding usb_put_dev() in the error handling code of
    dln2_probe().

    soundwire: qcom: gracefully handle too many ports in DT
    
    [ Upstream commit 2367e0ecb498764e95cfda691ff0828f7d25f9a4 ]
    
    There are two issues related to the number of ports coming from
    Devicetree when exceeding in total QCOM_SDW_MAX_PORTS.  Both lead to
    incorrect memory accesses:
    1. With DTS having too big value of input or output ports, the driver,
       when copying port parameters from local/stack arrays into 'pconfig'
       array in 'struct qcom_swrm_ctrl', will iterate over their sizes.
    
    2. If DTS also has too many parameters for these ports (e.g.
       qcom,ports-sinterval-low), the driver will overflow buffers on the
       stack when reading these properties from DTS.
    
    Add a sanity check so incorrect DTS will not cause kernel memory
    corruption.

    iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Acknowledge pri/event queue overflow if any
    
    [ Upstream commit 67ea0b7ce41844eae7c10bb04dfe66a23318c224 ]
    
    When an overflow occurs in the PRI queue, the SMMU toggles the overflow
    flag in the PROD register. To exit the overflow condition, the PRI thread
    is supposed to acknowledge it by toggling this flag in the CONS register.
    Unacknowledged overflow causes the queue to stop adding anything new.
    
    Currently, the priq thread always writes the CONS register back to the
    SMMU after clearing the queue.
    
    The writeback is not necessary if the OVFLG in the PROD register has not
    been changed, no overflow has occured.
    
    This commit checks the difference of the overflow flag between CONS and
    PROD register. If it's different, toggles the OVACKFLG flag in the CONS
    register and write it to the SMMU.
    
    The situation is similar for the event queue.
    The acknowledge register is also toggled after clearing the event
    queue but never propagated to the hardware. This would only be done the
    next time when executing evtq thread.
    
    Unacknowledged event queue overflow doesn't affect the event
    queue, because the SMMU still adds elements to that queue when the
    overflow condition is active.
    But it feel nicer to keep SMMU in sync when possible, so use the same
    way here as well.

    fs/ntfs3: Fix a possible null-pointer dereference in ni_clear()
    
    [ Upstream commit ec275bf9693d19cc0fdce8436f4c425ced86f6e7 ]
    
    In a previous commit c1006bd13146, ni->mi.mrec in ni_write_inode()
    could be NULL, and thus a NULL check is added for this variable.
    
    However, in the same call stack, ni->mi.mrec can be also dereferenced
    in ni_clear():
    
    ntfs_evict_inode(inode)
      ni_write_inode(inode, ...)
        ni = ntfs_i(inode);
        is_rec_inuse(ni->mi.mrec) -> Add a NULL check by previous commit
      ni_clear(ntfs_i(inode))
        is_rec_inuse(ni->mi.mrec) -> No check
    
    Thus, a possible null-pointer dereference may exist in ni_clear().
    To fix it, a NULL check is added in this function.

    fs/ntfs3: Validate MFT flags before replaying logs
    
    [ Upstream commit 98bea253aa28ad8be2ce565a9ca21beb4a9419e5 ]
    
    Log load and replay is part of the metadata handle flow during mount
    operation. The $MFT record will be loaded and used while replaying logs.
    However, a malformed $MFT record, say, has RECORD_FLAG_DIR flag set and
    contains an ATTR_ROOT attribute will misguide kernel to treat it as a
    directory, and try to free the allocated resources when the
    corresponding inode is freed, which will cause an invalid kfree because
    the memory hasn't actually been allocated.

    fs/ntfs3: Fix NULL dereference in ni_write_inode
    
    [ Upstream commit 8dae4f6341e335a09575be60b4fdf697c732a470 ]
    
    Syzbot reports a NULL dereference in ni_write_inode.
    When creating a new inode, if allocation fails in mi_init function
    (called in mi_format_new function), mi->mrec is set to NULL.
    In the error path of this inode creation, mi->mrec is later
    dereferenced in ni_write_inode.
    
    Add a NULL check to prevent NULL dereference.

    fs/ntfs3: Enhance the attribute size check
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f082a7531223a438c757bb20e304f4c941c67a8 ]
    
    This combines the overflow and boundary check so that all attribute size
    will be properly examined while enumerating them.

    iommu/arm-smmu-qcom: Limit the SMR groups to 128
    
    [ Upstream commit 12261134732689b7e30c59db9978f81230965181 ]
    
    Some platforms support more than 128 stream matching groups than what is
    defined by the ARM SMMU architecture specification. But due to some unknown
    reasons, those additional groups don't exhibit the same behavior as the
    architecture supported ones.
    
    For instance, the additional groups will not detect the quirky behavior of
    some firmware versions intercepting writes to S2CR register, thus skipping
    the quirk implemented in the driver and causing boot crash.
    
    So let's limit the groups to 128 for now until the issue with those groups
    are fixed and issue a notice to users in that case.

    RDMA/core: Fix multiple -Warray-bounds warnings
    
    [ Upstream commit aa4d540b4150052ae3b36d286b9c833a961ce291 ]
    
    GCC-13 (and Clang)[1] does not like to access a partially allocated
    object, since it cannot reason about it for bounds checking.
    
    In this case 140 bytes are allocated for an object of type struct
    ib_umad_packet:
    
            packet = kzalloc(sizeof(*packet) + IB_MGMT_RMPP_HDR, GFP_KERNEL);
    
    However, notice that sizeof(*packet) is only 104 bytes:
    
    struct ib_umad_packet {
            struct ib_mad_send_buf *   msg;                  /*     0     8 */
            struct ib_mad_recv_wc *    recv_wc;              /*     8     8 */
            struct list_head           list;                 /*    16    16 */
            int                        length;               /*    32     4 */
    
            /* XXX 4 bytes hole, try to pack */
    
            struct ib_user_mad         mad __attribute__((__aligned__(8))); /*    40    64 */
    
            /* size: 104, cachelines: 2, members: 5 */
            /* sum members: 100, holes: 1, sum holes: 4 */
            /* forced alignments: 1, forced holes: 1, sum forced holes: 4 */
            /* last cacheline: 40 bytes */
    } __attribute__((__aligned__(8)));
    
    and 36 bytes extra bytes are allocated for a flexible-array member in
    struct ib_user_mad:
    
    include/rdma/ib_mad.h:
    120 enum {
    ...
    123         IB_MGMT_RMPP_HDR = 36,
    ... }
    
    struct ib_user_mad {
            struct ib_user_mad_hdr     hdr;                  /*     0    64 */
            /* --- cacheline 1 boundary (64 bytes) --- */
            __u64                      data[] __attribute__((__aligned__(8))); /*    64     0 */
    
            /* size: 64, cachelines: 1, members: 2 */
            /* forced alignments: 1 */
    } __attribute__((__aligned__(8)));
    
    So we have sizeof(*packet) + IB_MGMT_RMPP_HDR == 140 bytes
    
    Then the address of the flex-array member (for which only 36 bytes were
    allocated) is casted and copied into a pointer to struct ib_rmpp_mad,
    which, in turn, is of size 256 bytes:
    
            rmpp_mad = (struct ib_rmpp_mad *) packet->mad.data;
    
    struct ib_rmpp_mad {
            struct ib_mad_hdr          mad_hdr;              /*     0    24 */
            struct ib_rmpp_hdr         rmpp_hdr;             /*    24    12 */
            u8                         data[220];            /*    36   220 */
    
            /* size: 256, cachelines: 4, members: 3 */
    };
    
    The thing is that those 36 bytes allocated for flex-array member data
    in struct ib_user_mad onlly account for the size of both struct ib_mad_hdr
    and struct ib_rmpp_hdr, but nothing is left for array u8 data[220].
    So, the compiler is legitimately complaining about accessing an object
    for which not enough memory was allocated.
    
    Apparently, the only members of struct ib_rmpp_mad that are relevant
    (that are actually being used) in function ib_umad_write() are mad_hdr
    and rmpp_hdr. So, instead of casting packet->mad.data to
    (struct ib_rmpp_mad *) create a new structure
    
    struct ib_rmpp_mad_hdr {
            struct ib_mad_hdr       mad_hdr;
            struct ib_rmpp_hdr      rmpp_hdr;
    } __packed;
    
    and cast packet->mad.data to (struct ib_rmpp_mad_hdr *).
    
    Notice that
    
            IB_MGMT_RMPP_HDR == sizeof(struct ib_rmpp_mad_hdr) == 36 bytes
    
    Refactor the rest of the code, accordingly.
    
    Fix the following warnings seen under GCC-13 and -Warray-bounds:

    mcb-pci requests a fixed-size memory region to parse the chameleon
    table, however, if the chameleon table is smaller that the allocated
    region, it could overlap with the IP Cores' memory regions.
    
    After parsing the chameleon table, drop/reallocate the memory region
    with the actual chameleon table size.

    serial: 8250: Reinit port->pm on port specific driver unbind
    
    [ Upstream commit 04e82793f068d2f0ffe62fcea03d007a8cdc16a7 ]
    
    When we unbind a serial port hardware specific 8250 driver, the generic
    serial8250 driver takes over the port. After that we see an oops about 10
    seconds later. This can produce the following at least on some TI SoCs:
    
    Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort (0x1406)
    Internal error: : 1406 [#1] SMP ARM
    
    Turns out that we may still have the serial port hardware specific driver
    port->pm in use, and serial8250_pm() tries to call it after the port
    specific driver is gone:
    
    serial8250_pm [8250_base] from uart_change_pm+0x54/0x8c [serial_base]
    uart_change_pm [serial_base] from uart_hangup+0x154/0x198 [serial_base]
    uart_hangup [serial_base] from __tty_hangup.part.0+0x328/0x37c
    __tty_hangup.part.0 from disassociate_ctty+0x154/0x20c
    disassociate_ctty from do_exit+0x744/0xaac
    do_exit from do_group_exit+0x40/0x8c
    do_group_exit from __wake_up_parent+0x0/0x1c
    
    Let's fix the issue by calling serial8250_set_defaults() in
    serial8250_unregister_port(). This will set the port back to using
    the serial8250 default functions, and sets the port->pm to point to
    serial8250_pm.

    HID: wacom: generic: Set battery quirk only when we see battery data
    
    [ Upstream commit bea407a427baa019758f29f4d31b26f008bb8cc6 ]
    
    Some devices will include battery status usages in the HID descriptor
    but we won't see that battery data for one reason or another. For example,
    AES sensors won't send battery data unless an AES pen is in proximity.
    If a user does not have an AES pen but instead only interacts with the
    AES touchscreen with their fingers then there is no need for us to create
    a battery object. Similarly, if a family of peripherals shares the same
    HID descriptor between wired-only and wireless-capable SKUs, users of the
    former may never see a battery event and will not want a power_supply
    object created.

    spi: spi-imx: fix MX51_ECSPI_* macros when cs > 3
    
    [ Upstream commit 87c614175bbf28d3fd076dc2d166bac759e41427 ]
    
    When using gpio based chip select the cs value can go outside the range
    0 – 3. The various MX51_ECSPI_* macros did not take this into consideration
    resulting in possible corruption of the configuration.
    
    For example for any cs value over 3 the SCLKPHA bits would not be set and
    other values in the register possibly corrupted.
    
    One way to fix this is to just mask the cs bits to 2 bits. This still
    allows all 4 native chip selects to work as well as gpio chip selects
    (which can use any of the 4 chip select configurations).

    HID: logitech-hidpp: Reconcile USB and Unifying serials
    
    [ Upstream commit 5b3691d15e04b6d5a32c915577b8dbc5cfb56382 ]
    
    Now that USB HID++ devices can gather a serial number that matches the
    one that would be gathered when connected through a Unifying receiver,
    remove the last difference by dropping the product ID as devices
    usually have different product IDs when connected through USB or
    Unifying.
    
    For example, on the serials on a G903 wired/wireless mouse:
    - Unifying before patch: 4067-e8-ce-cd-45
    - USB before patch: c086-e8-ce-cd-45
    - Unifying and USB after patch: e8-ce-cd-45

    HID: logitech-hidpp: Don't use the USB serial for USB devices
    
    [ Upstream commit 7ad1fe0da0fa91bf920b79ab05ae97bfabecc4f4 ]
    
    For devices that support the 0x0003 feature (Device Information) version 4,
    set the serial based on the output of that feature, rather than relying
    on the usbhid code setting the USB serial.
    
    This should allow the serial when connected through USB to (nearly)
    match the one when connected through a unifying receiver.
    
    For example, on the serials on a G903 wired/wireless mouse:
    - Unifying: 4067-e8-ce-cd-45
    - USB before patch: 017C385C3837

    Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Fall back to getting bdaddr from EFI if not set
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d218c3642b9ccf71f44987cd03c19320f3bd918 ]
    
    On some devices the BCM Bluetooth adapter does not have a valid bdaddr set.
    
    btbcm.c currently sets HCI_QUIRK_INVALID_BDADDR to indicate when this is
    the case. But this requires users to manual setup a btaddr, by doing e.g.:
    
    btmgmt -i hci0 public-addr 'B0:F1:EC:82:1D:B3'
    
    Which means that Bluetooth will not work out of the box on such devices.
    To avoid this (where possible) hci_bcm sets: HCI_QUIRK_USE_BDADDR_PROPERTY
    which tries to get the bdaddr from devicetree.
    
    But this only works on devicetree platforms. On UEFI based platforms
    there is a special Broadcom UEFI variable which when present contains
    the devices bdaddr, just like how there is another UEFI variable which
    contains wifi nvram contents including the wifi MAC address.
    
    Add support for getting the bdaddr from this Broadcom UEFI variable,
    so that Bluetooth will work OOTB for users on devices where this
    UEFI variable is present.
    
    This fixes Bluetooth not working on for example Asus T100HA 2-in-1s.

    ipvs: Update width of source for ip_vs_sync_conn_options
    
    [ Upstream commit e3478c68f6704638d08f437cbc552ca5970c151a ]
    
    In ip_vs_sync_conn_v0() copy is made to struct ip_vs_sync_conn_options.
    That structure looks like this:
    
    struct ip_vs_sync_conn_options {
            struct ip_vs_seq        in_seq;
            struct ip_vs_seq        out_seq;
    };
    
    The source of the copy is the in_seq field of struct ip_vs_conn.  Whose
    type is struct ip_vs_seq. Thus we can see that the source - is not as
    wide as the amount of data copied, which is the width of struct
    ip_vs_sync_conn_option.
    
    The copy is safe because the next field in is another struct ip_vs_seq.
    Make use of struct_group() to annotate this.

    The reason for triggering this warning is __block_write_full_page()
    -> i_size_read(inode) - 1 overflow.
    inode->i_size is assigned in __nbd_ioctl() -> nbd_set_size() -> bytesize.
    We think it is necessary to limit the size of arg to prevent errors.
    
    Moreover, __nbd_ioctl() -> nbd_add_socket(), arg will be cast to int.
    Assuming the value of arg is 0x80000000000000001) (on a 64-bit machine),
    it will become 1 after the coercion, which will return unexpected results.
    
    Fix it by adding checks to prevent passing in too large numbers.

    wifi: ath11k: Fix SKB corruption in REO destination ring
    
    [ Upstream commit f9fff67d2d7ca6fa8066132003a3deef654c55b1 ]
    
    While running traffics for a long time, randomly an RX descriptor
    filled with value "0" from REO destination ring is received.
    This descriptor which is invalid causes the wrong SKB (SKB stored in
    the IDR lookup with buffer id "0") to be fetched which in turn
    causes SKB memory corruption issue and the same leads to crash
    after some time.
    
    Changed the start id for idr allocation to "1" and the buffer id "0"
    is reserved for error validation. Introduced Sanity check to validate
    the descriptor, before processing the SKB.
    
    Crash Signature :

    null_blk: Always check queue mode setting from configfs
    
    [ Upstream commit 63f8793ee60513a09f110ea460a6ff2c33811cdb ]
    
    Make sure to check device queue mode in the null_validate_conf() and
    return error for NULL_Q_RQ as we don't allow legacy I/O path, without
    this patch we get OOPs when queue mode is set to 1 from configfs,
    following are repro steps :-
    
    modprobe null_blk nr_devices=0
    mkdir config/nullb/nullb0
    echo 1 > config/nullb/nullb0/memory_backed
    echo 4096 > config/nullb/nullb0/blocksize
    echo 20480 > config/nullb/nullb0/size
    echo 1 > config/nullb/nullb0/queue_mode
    echo 1 > config/nullb/nullb0/power

    wifi: iwlwifi: pcie: Fix integer overflow in iwl_write_to_user_buf
    
    [ Upstream commit 58d1b717879bfeabe09b35e41ad667c79933eb2e ]
    
    An integer overflow occurs in the iwl_write_to_user_buf() function,
    which is called by the iwl_dbgfs_monitor_data_read() function.
    
    static bool iwl_write_to_user_buf(char __user *user_buf, ssize_t count,
                                      void *buf, ssize_t *size,
                                      ssize_t *bytes_copied)
    {
            int buf_size_left = count - *bytes_copied;
    
            buf_size_left = buf_size_left - (buf_size_left % sizeof(u32));
            if (*size > buf_size_left)
                    *size = buf_size_left;
    
    If the user passes a SIZE_MAX value to the "ssize_t count" parameter,
    the ssize_t count parameter is assigned to "int buf_size_left".
    Then compare "*size" with "buf_size_left" . Here, "buf_size_left" is a
    negative number, so "*size" is assigned "buf_size_left" and goes into
    the third argument of the copy_to_user function, causing a heap overflow.
    
    This is not a security vulnerability because iwl_dbgfs_monitor_data_read()
    is a debugfs operation with 0400 privileges.

    ext4: Fix best extent lstart adjustment logic in ext4_mb_new_inode_pa()
    
    [ Upstream commit 93cdf49f6eca5e23f6546b8f28457b2e6a6961d9 ]
    
    When the length of best extent found is less than the length of goal extent
    we need to make sure that the best extent atleast covers the start of the
    original request. This is done by adjusting the ac_b_ex.fe_logical (logical
    start) of the extent.
    
    While doing so, the current logic sometimes results in the best extent's
    logical range overflowing the goal extent. Since this best extent is later
    added to the inode preallocation list, we have a possibility of introducing
    overlapping preallocations. This is discussed in detail here [1].
    
    As per Jan's suggestion, to fix this, replace the existing logic with the
    below logic for adjusting best extent as it keeps fragmentation in check
    while ensuring logical range of best extent doesn't overflow out of goal
    extent:

    ext4: set goal start correctly in ext4_mb_normalize_request
    
    [ Upstream commit b07ffe6927c75d99af534d685282ea188d9f71a6 ]
    
    We need to set ac_g_ex to notify the goal start used in
    ext4_mb_find_by_goal. Set ac_g_ex instead of ac_f_ex in
    ext4_mb_normalize_request.
    Besides we should assure goal start is in range [first_data_block,
    blocks_count) as ext4_mb_initialize_context does.
    
    [ Added a check to make sure size is less than ar->pright; otherwise
      we could end up passing an underflowed value of ar->pright - size to
      ext4_get_group_no_and_offset(), which will trigger a BUG_ON later on.

    gfs2: Fix inode height consistency check
    
    [ Upstream commit cfcdb5bad34f600aed7613c3c1a5e618111f77b7 ]
    
    The maximum allowed height of an inode's metadata tree depends on the
    filesystem block size; it is lower for bigger-block filesystems.  When
    reading in an inode, make sure that the height doesn't exceed the
    maximum allowed height.
    
    Arrays like sd_heightsize are sized to be big enough for any filesystem
    block size; they will often be slightly bigger than what's needed for a
    specific filesystem.

    scsi: message: mptlan: Fix use after free bug in mptlan_remove() due to race condition
    
    [ Upstream commit f486893288f3e9b171b836f43853a6426515d800 ]
    
    mptlan_probe() calls mpt_register_lan_device() which initializes the
    &priv->post_buckets_task workqueue. A call to
    mpt_lan_wake_post_buckets_task() will subsequently start the work.
    
    During driver unload in mptlan_remove() the following race may occur:
    
    CPU0                  CPU1
    
                        |mpt_lan_post_receive_buckets_work()
    mptlan_remove()     |
      free_netdev()     |

                        | dev->mtu
                        |   //use
    
    Fix this by finishing the work prior to cleaning up in mptlan_remove().

    lib: cpu_rmap: Avoid use after free on rmap->obj array entries
    
    [ Upstream commit 4e0473f1060aa49621d40a113afde24818101d37 ]
    
    When calling irq_set_affinity_notifier() with NULL at the notify
    argument, it will cause freeing of the glue pointer in the
    corresponding array entry but will leave the pointer in the array. A
    subsequent call to free_irq_cpu_rmap() will try to free this entry again
    leading to possible use after free.
    
    Fix that by setting NULL to the array entry and checking that we have
    non-zero at the array entry when iterating over the array in
    free_irq_cpu_rmap().
    
    The current code does not suffer from this since there are no cases
    where irq_set_affinity_notifier(irq, NULL) (note the NULL passed for the
    notify arg) is called, followed by a call to free_irq_cpu_rmap() so we
    don't hit and issue. Subsequent patches in this series excersize this
    flow, hence the required fix.

    net: Catch invalid index in XPS mapping
    
    [ Upstream commit 5dd0dfd55baec0742ba8f5625a0dd064aca7db16 ]
    
    When setting the XPS value of a TX queue, warn the user once if the
    index of the queue is greater than the number of allocated TX queues.
    
    Previously, this scenario went uncaught. In the best case, it resulted
    in unnecessary allocations. In the worst case, it resulted in
    out-of-bounds memory references through calls to `netdev_get_tx_queue(
    dev, index)`. Therefore, it is important to inform the user but not
    worth returning an error and risk downing the netdevice.

    net: pasemi: Fix return type of pasemi_mac_start_tx()
    
    [ Upstream commit c8384d4a51e7cb0e6587f3143f29099f202c5de1 ]
    
    With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
    indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
    pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
    ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
    which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed. A
    warning in clang aims to catch these at compile time, which reveals:
    
      drivers/net/ethernet/pasemi/pasemi_mac.c:1665:21: error: incompatible function pointer types initializing 'netdev_tx_t (*)(struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)' (aka 'enum netdev_tx (*)(struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)') with an expression of type 'int (struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)' [-Werror,-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types-strict]

                                        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      1 error generated.
    
    ->ndo_start_xmit() in 'struct net_device_ops' expects a return type of
    'netdev_tx_t', not 'int'. Adjust the return type of
    pasemi_mac_start_tx() to match the prototype's to resolve the warning.
    While PowerPC does not currently implement support for kCFI, it could in
    the future, which means this warning becomes a fatal CFI failure at run
    time.

    Apparently the hex passphrase mechanism does not work on newer

    OpenBSD has been doing it like this from the beginning, so this should
    work on all chips.
    
    Also clear the structure before setting the PMK. This was leaking
    uninitialized stack contents to the device.

    media: Prefer designated initializers over memset for subdev pad ops
    
    [ Upstream commit e3a69496a1cde364c74a600d7a370179b58aed29 ]
    
    Structures passed to subdev pad operations are all zero-initialized, but
    not always with the same kind of code constructs. While most drivers
    used designated initializers, which zero all the fields that are not
    specified, when declaring variables, some use memset(). Those two
    methods lead to the same end result, and, depending on compiler
    optimizations, may even be completely equivalent, but they're not
    consistent.
    
    Improve coding style consistency by using designated initializers
    instead of calling memset(). Where applicable, also move the variables
    to inner scopes of for loops to ensure correct initialization in all
    iterations.

    in bios parser") fixed some of this, but there are two other cases
    not covered by it.  Fix those as well.

    drm/msm/dp: Clean up handling of DP AUX interrupts
    
    [ Upstream commit b20566cdef05cd40d95f10869d2a7646f48b1bbe ]
    
    The DP AUX interrupt handling was a bit of a mess.
    * There were two functions (one for "native" transfers and one for
      "i2c" transfers) that were quite similar. It was hard to say how
      many of the differences between the two functions were on purpose
      and how many of them were just an accident of how they were coded.
    * Each function sometimes used "else if" to test for error bits and
      sometimes didn't and again it was hard to say if this was on purpose
      or just an accident.
    * The two functions wouldn't notice whether "unknown" bits were
      set. For instance, there seems to be a bit "DP_INTR_PLL_UNLOCKED"
      and if it was set there would be no indication.
    * The two functions wouldn't notice if more than one error was set.
    
    Let's fix this by being more consistent / explicit about what we're
    doing.
    
    By design this could cause different handling for AUX transfers,
    though I'm not actually aware of any bug fixed as a result of
    this patch (this patch was created because we simply noticed how odd
    the old code was by code inspection). Specific notes here:
    1. In the old native transfer case if we got "done + wrong address"
       we'd ignore the "wrong address" (because of the "else if"). Now we
       won't.
    2. In the old native transfer case if we got "done + timeout" we'd
       ignore the "timeout" (because of the "else if"). Now we won't.
    3. In the old native transfer case we'd see "nack_defer" and translate
       it to the error number for "nack". This differed from the i2c
       transfer case where "nack_defer" was given the error number for
       "nack_defer". This 100% can't matter because the only user of this
       error number treats "nack defer" the same as "nack", so it's clear
       that the difference between the "native" and "i2c" was pointless
       here.
    4. In the old i2c transfer case if we got "done" plus any error
       besides "nack" or "defer" then we'd ignore the error. Now we don't.
    5. If there is more than one error signaled by the hardware it's
       possible that we'll report a different one than we used to. I don't
       know if this matters. If someone is aware of a case this matters we
       should document it and change the code to make it explicit.
    6. One quirk we keep (I don't know if this is important) is that in
       the i2c transfer case if we see "done + defer" we report that as a
       "nack". That seemed too intentional in the old code to just drop.
    
    After this change we will add extra logging, including:
    * A warning if we see more than one error bit set.
    * A warning if we see an unexpected interrupt.
    * A warning if we get an AUX transfer interrupt when shouldn't.
    
    It actually turns out that as a result of this change then at boot we
    sometimes see an error:
      [drm:dp_aux_isr] *ERROR* Unexpected DP AUX IRQ 0x01000000 when not busy
    That means that, during init, we are seeing DP_INTR_PLL_UNLOCKED. For
    now I'm going to say that leaving this error reported in the logs is
    OK-ish and hopefully it will encourage someone to track down what's
    going on at init time.
    
    One last note here is that this change renames one of the interrupt
    bits. The bit named "i2c done" clearly was used for native transfers
    being done too, so I renamed it to indicate this.

    multiplied by 1000, and assigned to the u64 variable pclk. We can avoid

    When removing custom query handlers, the handler might still

    sdei_cpuhp_up() is called in the STARTING hotplug section,
    which runs with interrupts disabled. Use a CPUHP_AP_ONLINE_DYN entry
    instead to execute the cpuhp cb later, with preemption enabled.
    
    SDEI originally got its own cpuhp slot to allow interacting
    with perf. It got superseded by pNMI and this early slot is not
    relevant anymore. [1]
    
    Some SDEI calls (e.g. SDEI_1_0_FN_SDEI_PE_MASK) take actions on the
    calling CPU. It is checked that preemption is disabled for them.
    _ONLINE cpuhp cb are executed in the 'per CPU hotplug thread'.
    Preemption is enabled in those threads, but their cpumask is limited
    to 1 CPU.
    Move 'WARN_ON_ONCE(preemptible())' statements so that SDEI cpuhp cb
    don't trigger them.
    
    Also add a check for the SDEI_1_0_FN_SDEI_PRIVATE_RESET SDEI call
    which acts on the calling CPU.

    media: pci: tw68: Fix null-ptr-deref bug in buf prepare and finish
    
    [ Upstream commit 1634b7adcc5bef645b3666fdd564e5952a9e24e0 ]
    
    When the driver calls tw68_risc_buffer() to prepare the buffer, the
    function call dma_alloc_coherent may fail, resulting in a empty buffer
    buf->cpu. Later when we free the buffer or access the buffer, null ptr
    deref is triggered.
    
    This bug is similar to the following one:
    https://git.linuxtv.org/media_stage.git/commit/?id=2b064d91440b33fba5b452f2d1b31f13ae911d71.
    
    We believe the bug can be also dynamically triggered from user side.
    Similarly, we fix this by checking the return value of tw68_risc_buffer()
    and the value of buf->cpu before buffer free.

    When the driver calls cx23885_risc_buffer() to prepare the buffer, the
    function call dma_alloc_coherent may fail, resulting in a empty buffer
    risc->cpu. Later when we free the buffer or access the buffer, null ptr
    deref is triggered.
    
    This bug is similar to the following one:
    https://git.linuxtv.org/media_stage.git/commit/?id=2b064d91440b33fba5b452f2d1b31f13ae911d71.
    
    We believe the bug can be also dynamically triggered from user side.
    Similarly, we fix this by checking the return value of cx23885_risc_buffer()
    and the value of risc->cpu before buffer free.

    drm/amd/display: Use DC_LOG_DC in the trasform pixel function
    
    [ Upstream commit 7222f5841ff49709ca666b05ff336776e0664a20 ]
    
    [Why & How]
    DC now uses a new commit sequence which is more robust since it
    addresses cases where we need to reorganize pipes based on planes and
    other parameters. As a result, this new commit sequence reset the DC
    state by cleaning plane states and re-creating them accordingly with the
    need. For this reason, the dce_transform_set_pixel_storage_depth can be
    invoked after a plane state is destroyed and before its re-creation. In
    this situation and on DCE devices, DC will hit a condition that will
    trigger a dmesg log that looks like this:

    rcu: Protect rcu_print_task_exp_stall() ->exp_tasks access
    
    [ Upstream commit 3c1566bca3f8349f12b75d0a2d5e4a20ad6262ec ]
    
    For kernels built with CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU=y, the following scenario can
    result in a NULL-pointer dereference:
    
               CPU1                                           CPU2
    rcu_preempt_deferred_qs_irqrestore                rcu_print_task_exp_stall
      if (special.b.blocked)                            READ_ONCE(rnp->exp_tasks) != NULL
        raw_spin_lock_rcu_node
        np = rcu_next_node_entry(t, rnp)
        if (&t->rcu_node_entry == rnp->exp_tasks)
          WRITE_ONCE(rnp->exp_tasks, np)
          ....
          raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore_rcu_node
                                                        raw_spin_lock_irqsave_rcu_node
                                                        t = list_entry(rnp->exp_tasks->prev,
                                                            struct task_struct, rcu_node_entry)
                                                        (if rnp->exp_tasks is NULL, this
                                                           will dereference a NULL pointer)
    
    The problem is that CPU2 accesses the rcu_node structure's->exp_tasks
    field without holding the rcu_node structure's ->lock and CPU2 did
    not observe CPU1's change to rcu_node structure's ->exp_tasks in time.
    Therefore, if CPU1 sets rcu_node structure's->exp_tasks pointer to NULL,
    then CPU2 might dereference that NULL pointer.
    
    This commit therefore holds the rcu_node structure's ->lock while
    accessing that structure's->exp_tasks field.

    refscale: Move shutdown from wait_event() to wait_event_idle()
    
    [ Upstream commit 6bc6e6b27524304aadb9c04611ddb1c84dd7617a ]
    
    The ref_scale_shutdown() kthread/function uses wait_event() to wait for
    the refscale test to complete.  However, although the read-side tests
    are normally extremely fast, there is no law against specifying a very
    large value for the refscale.loops module parameter or against having
    a slow read-side primitive.  Either way, this might well trigger the
    hung-task timeout.
    
    This commit therefore replaces those wait_event() calls with calls to
    wait_event_idle(), which do not trigger the hung-task timeout.

    ext4: allow ext4_get_group_info() to fail
    
    [ Upstream commit 5354b2af34064a4579be8bc0e2f15a7b70f14b5f ]
    
    Previously, ext4_get_group_info() would treat an invalid group number
    as BUG(), since in theory it should never happen.  However, if a
    malicious attaker (or fuzzer) modifies the superblock via the block
    device while it is the file system is mounted, it is possible for
    s_first_data_block to get set to a very large number.  In that case,
    when calculating the block group of some block number (such as the
    starting block of a preallocation region), could result in an
    underflow and very large block group number.  Then the BUG_ON check in
    ext4_get_group_info() would fire, resutling in a denial of service
    attack that can be triggered by root or someone with write access to
    the block device.
    
    For a quality of implementation perspective, it's best that even if
    the system administrator does something that they shouldn't, that it
    will not trigger a BUG.  So instead of BUG'ing, ext4_get_group_info()
    will call ext4_error and return NULL.  We also add fallback code in
    all of the callers of ext4_get_group_info() that it might NULL.
    
    Also, since ext4_get_group_info() was already borderline to be an
    inline function, un-inline it.  The results in a next reduction of the
    compiled text size of ext4 by roughly 2k.

    ext4: fix lockdep warning when enabling MMP
    
    [ Upstream commit 949f95ff39bf188e594e7ecd8e29b82eb108f5bf ]
    
    When we enable MMP in ext4_multi_mount_protect() during mount or
    remount, we end up calling sb_start_write() from write_mmp_block(). This
    triggers lockdep warning because freeze protection ranks above s_umount
    semaphore we are holding during mount / remount. The problem is harmless
    because we are guaranteed the filesystem is not frozen during mount /
    remount but still let's fix the warning by not grabbing freeze
    protection from ext4_multi_mount_protect().

    ext4: remove an unused variable warning with CONFIG_QUOTA=n
    
    [ Upstream commit 3bbef91bdd2180c67407285ba160b023eb4d5306 ]
    
    The 'enable_quota' variable is only used in an CONFIG_QUOTA.
    With CONFIG_QUOTA=n, compiler causes a harmless warning:
    
    fs/ext4/super.c: In function ‘ext4_remount’:
    fs/ext4/super.c:5840:6: warning: variable ‘enable_quota’ set but not used
      [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
      int enable_quota = 0;
                  ^~~~~
    
    Move 'enable_quota' into the same #ifdef CONFIG_QUOTA block
    to remove an unused variable warning.

    Smatch complains that:

    Fix error handling in the arcfb_probe() function. If IO addresses are
    not provided or framebuffer registration fails, the code will jump to
    the err_addr or err_register_fb label to release resources.
    If IRQ request fails, previously allocated resources will be freed.

    drm_dp_dsc_sink_max_slice_count() may return 0 if something goes
    wrong on the part of the DSC sink and its DPCD register. This null
    value may be later used as a divisor in intel_dsc_compute_params(),
    which will lead to an error.
    In the unlikely event that this issue occurs, fix it by testing the
    return value of drm_dp_dsc_sink_max_slice_count() against zero.

    KCSAN found a data race around sk->sk_shutdown where unix_release_sock()
    and unix_shutdown() update it under unix_state_lock(), OTOH unix_poll()
    and unix_dgram_poll() read it locklessly.

    If skb enqueue the qdisc, fq_skb_cb(skb)->time_to_send is changed which
    is actually skb->cb, and IPCB(skb_in)->opt will be used in
    __ip_options_echo. It is possible that memcpy is out of bounds and lead
    to stack overflow.
    We should clear skb->cb before ip_local_out or ip6_local_out.

    1. clean the stack info
    2. use IPCB/IP6CB instead of skb->cb

    Clearing the PBA bit from the driver is race prone and it may lead to
    dropped interrupt events. This could potentially lead to the traffic
    being completely halted.

    net: add vlan_get_protocol_and_depth() helper
    
    [ Upstream commit 4063384ef762cc5946fc7a3f89879e76c6ec51e2 ]
    
    Before blamed commit, pskb_may_pull() was used instead
    of skb_header_pointer() in __vlan_get_protocol() and friends.
    
    Few callers depended on skb->head being populated with MAC header,
    syzbot caught one of them (skb_mac_gso_segment())
    
    Add vlan_get_protocol_and_depth() to make the intent clearer
    and use it where sensible.
    
    This is a more generic fix than commit e9d3f80935b6
    ("net/af_packet: make sure to pull mac header") which was
    dealing with a similar issue.

    netfilter: conntrack: fix possible bug_on with enable_hooks=1
    
    [ Upstream commit e72eeab542dbf4f544e389e64fa13b82a1b6d003 ]
    
    I received a bug report (no reproducer so far) where we trip over
    
    712         rcu_read_lock();
    713         ct_hook = rcu_dereference(nf_ct_hook);

    In nf_conntrack_destroy().
    
    First turn this BUG_ON into a WARN.  I think it was triggered
    via enable_hooks=1 flag.
    
    When this flag is turned on, the conntrack hooks are registered
    before nf_ct_hook pointer gets assigned.
    This opens a short window where packets enter the conntrack machinery,
    can have skb->_nfct set up and a subsequent kfree_skb might occur
    before nf_ct_hook is set.
    
    Call nf_conntrack_init_end() to set nf_ct_hook before we register the
    pernet ops.

    Its possible that the peer netns is also slated for removal.  In this

    net: stmmac: Initialize MAC_ONEUS_TIC_COUNTER register
    
    [ Upstream commit 8efbdbfa99381a017dd2c0f6375a7d80a8118b74 ]
    
    Initialize MAC_ONEUS_TIC_COUNTER register with correct value derived
    from CSR clock, otherwise EEE is unstable on at least NXP i.MX8M Plus
    and Micrel KSZ9131RNX PHY, to the point where not even ARP request can
    be sent out.
    
    i.MX 8M Plus Applications Processor Reference Manual, Rev. 1, 06/2021
    11.7.6.1.34 One-microsecond Reference Timer (MAC_ONEUS_TIC_COUNTER)
    defines this register as:
    "
    This register controls the generation of the Reference time (1 microsecond
    tic) for all the LPI timers. This timer has to be programmed by the software
    initially.
    ...
    The application must program this counter so that the number of clock cycles
    of CSR clock is 1us. (Subtract 1 from the value before programming).
    For example if the CSR clock is 100MHz then this field needs to be programmed
    to value 100 - 1 = 99 (which is 0x63).
    This is required to generate the 1US events that are used to update some of
    the EEE related counters.
    "
    
    The reset value is 0x63 on i.MX8M Plus, which means expected CSR clock are
    100 MHz. However, the i.MX8M Plus "enet_qos_root_clk" are 266 MHz instead,
    which means the LPI timers reach their count much sooner on this platform.
    
    This is visible using a scope by monitoring e.g. exit from LPI mode on TX_CTL
    line from MAC to PHY. This should take 30us per STMMAC_DEFAULT_TWT_LS setting,
    during which the TX_CTL line transitions from tristate to low, and 30 us later
    from low to high. On i.MX8M Plus, this transition takes 11 us, which matches
    the 30us * 100/266 formula for misconfigured MAC_ONEUS_TIC_COUNTER register.
    
    Configure MAC_ONEUS_TIC_COUNTER based on CSR clock, so that the LPI timers
    have correct 1us reference. This then fixes EEE on i.MX8M Plus with Micrel
    KSZ9131RNX PHY.

    tick/broadcast: Make broadcast device replacement work correctly
    
    [ Upstream commit f9d36cf445ffff0b913ba187a3eff78028f9b1fb ]
    
    When a tick broadcast clockevent device is initialized for one shot mode
    then tick_broadcast_setup_oneshot() OR's the periodic broadcast mode
    cpumask into the oneshot broadcast cpumask.
    
    This is required when switching from periodic broadcast mode to oneshot
    broadcast mode to ensure that CPUs which are waiting for periodic
    broadcast are woken up on the next tick.
    
    But it is subtly broken, when an active broadcast device is replaced and
    the system is already in oneshot (NOHZ/HIGHRES) mode. Victor observed
    this and debugged the issue.
    
    Then the OR of the periodic broadcast CPU mask is wrong as the periodic
    cpumask bits are sticky after tick_broadcast_enable() set it for a CPU
    unless explicitly cleared via tick_broadcast_disable().
    
    That means that this sets all other CPUs which have tick broadcasting
    enabled at that point unconditionally in the oneshot broadcast mask.
    
    If the affected CPUs were already idle and had their bits set in the
    oneshot broadcast mask then this does no harm. But for non idle CPUs
    which were not set this corrupts their state.
    
    On their next invocation of tick_broadcast_enable() they observe the bit
    set, which indicates that the broadcast for the CPU is already set up.
    As a consequence they fail to update the broadcast event even if their
    earliest expiring timer is before the actually programmed broadcast
    event.
    
    If the programmed broadcast event is far in the future, then this can
    cause stalls or trigger the hung task detector.
    
    Avoid this by telling tick_broadcast_setup_oneshot() explicitly whether
    this is the initial switch over from periodic to oneshot broadcast which
    must take the periodic broadcast mask into account. In the case of
    initialization of a replacement device this prevents that the broadcast
    oneshot mask is modified.
    
    There is a second problem with broadcast device replacement in this
    function. The broadcast device is only armed when the previous state of
    the device was periodic.
    
    That is correct for the switch from periodic broadcast mode to oneshot
    broadcast mode as the underlying broadcast device could operate in
    oneshot state already due to lack of periodic state in hardware. In that
    case it is already armed to expire at the next tick.
    
    For the replacement case this is wrong as the device is in shutdown
    state. That means that any already pending broadcast event will not be
    armed.
    
    This went unnoticed because any CPU which goes idle will observe that
    the broadcast device has an expiry time of KTIME_MAX and therefore any
    CPUs next timer event will be earlier and cause a reprogramming of the
    broadcast device. But that does not guarantee that the events of the
    CPUs which were already in idle are delivered on time.
    
    Fix this by arming the newly installed device for an immediate event
    which will reevaluate the per CPU expiry times and reprogram the
    broadcast device accordingly. This is simpler than caching the last
    expiry time in yet another place or saving it before the device exchange
    and handing it down to the setup function. Replacement of broadcast
    devices is not a frequent operation and usually happens once somewhere
    late in the boot process.

    drm/mipi-dsi: Set the fwnode for mipi_dsi_device
    
    [ Upstream commit a26cc2934331b57b5a7164bff344f0a2ec245fc0 ]
    
    After commit 3fb16866b51d ("driver core: fw_devlink: Make cycle
    detection more robust"), fw_devlink prints an error when consumer
    devices don't have their fwnode set. This used to be ignored silently.
    
    Set the fwnode mipi_dsi_device so fw_devlink can find them and properly
    track their dependencies.
    
    This fixes errors like this:
    [    0.334054] nwl-dsi 30a00000.mipi-dsi: Failed to create device link with regulator-lcd-1v8
    [    0.346964] nwl-dsi 30a00000.mipi-dsi: Failed to create device link with backlight-dsi
