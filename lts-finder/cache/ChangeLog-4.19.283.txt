    mm/page_alloc: fix potential deadlock on zonelist_update_seq seqlock
    
    commit 1007843a91909a4995ee78a538f62d8665705b66 upstream.
    
    syzbot is reporting circular locking dependency which involves
    zonelist_update_seq seqlock [1], for this lock is checked by memory
    allocation requests which do not need to be retried.
    
    One deadlock scenario is kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC) from an interrupt handler.
    
      CPU0
      ----
      __build_all_zonelists() {
        write_seqlock(&zonelist_update_seq); // makes zonelist_update_seq.seqcount odd
        // e.g. timer interrupt handler runs at this moment
          some_timer_func() {
            kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC) {
              __alloc_pages_slowpath() {
                read_seqbegin(&zonelist_update_seq) {
                  // spins forever because zonelist_update_seq.seqcount is odd
                }
              }
            }
          }
        // e.g. timer interrupt handler finishes
        write_sequnlock(&zonelist_update_seq); // makes zonelist_update_seq.seqcount even
      }
    
    This deadlock scenario can be easily eliminated by not calling
    read_seqbegin(&zonelist_update_seq) from !__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM allocation
    requests, for retry is applicable to only __GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM allocation
    requests.  But Michal Hocko does not know whether we should go with this
    approach.
    
    Another deadlock scenario which syzbot is reporting is a race between
    kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC) from tty_insert_flip_string_and_push_buffer() with
    port->lock held and printk() from __build_all_zonelists() with
    zonelist_update_seq held.

                        }
                      }

                                                     }
                                                   }
                                                 }
                                               }
                                               write_sequnlock(&zonelist_update_seq);
                                             }
        }
      }
    
    This deadlock scenario can be eliminated by
    
      preventing interrupt context from calling kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC)
    
    and
    
      preventing printk() from calling console_flush_all()
    
    while zonelist_update_seq.seqcount is odd.
    
    Since Petr Mladek thinks that __build_all_zonelists() can become a
    candidate for deferring printk() [2], let's address this problem by
    
      disabling local interrupts in order to avoid kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC)
    
    and
    
      disabling synchronous printk() in order to avoid console_flush_all()
    
    .
    
    As a side effect of minimizing duration of zonelist_update_seq.seqcount
    being odd by disabling synchronous printk(), latency at
    read_seqbegin(&zonelist_update_seq) for both !__GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM and
    __GFP_DIRECT_RECLAIM allocation requests will be reduced.  Although, from
    lockdep perspective, not calling read_seqbegin(&zonelist_update_seq) (i.e.
    do not record unnecessary locking dependency) from interrupt context is
    still preferable, even if we don't allow calling kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC)
    inside
    write_seqlock(&zonelist_update_seq)/write_sequnlock(&zonelist_update_seq)
    section...

    printk: declare printk_deferred_{enter,safe}() in include/linux/printk.h
    
    commit 85e3e7fbbb720b9897fba9a99659e31cbd1c082e upstream.
    
    [This patch implements subset of original commit 85e3e7fbbb72 ("printk:
    remove NMI tracking") where commit 1007843a9190 ("mm/page_alloc: fix
    potential deadlock on zonelist_update_seq seqlock") depends on, for
    commit 3d36424b3b58 ("mm/page_alloc: fix race condition between
    build_all_zonelists and page allocation") was backported to stable.]
    
    All NMI contexts are handled the same as the safe context: store the
    message and defer printing. There is no need to have special NMI
    context tracking for this. Using in_nmi() is enough.
    
    There are several parts of the kernel that are manually calling into
    the printk NMI context tracking in order to cause general printk
    deferred printing:
    
        arch/arm/kernel/smp.c
        arch/powerpc/kexec/crash.c
        kernel/trace/trace.c
    
    For arm/kernel/smp.c and powerpc/kexec/crash.c, provide a new
    function pair printk_deferred_enter/exit that explicitly achieves the
    same objective.
    
    For ftrace, remove the printk context manipulation completely. It was
    added in commit 03fc7f9c99c1 ("printk/nmi: Prevent deadlock when
    accessing the main log buffer in NMI"). The purpose was to enforce
    storing messages directly into the ring buffer even in NMI context.
    It really should have only modified the behavior in NMI context.
    There is no need for a special behavior any longer. All messages are
    always stored directly now. The console deferring is handled
    transparently in vprintk().

    PCI: pciehp: Fix AB-BA deadlock between reset_lock and device_lock
    
    commit f5eff5591b8f9c5effd25c92c758a127765f74c1 upstream.
    
    In 2013, commits
    
      2e35afaefe64 ("PCI: pciehp: Add reset_slot() method")
      608c388122c7 ("PCI: Add slot reset option to pci_dev_reset()")
    
    amended PCIe hotplug to mask Presence Detect Changed events during a
    Secondary Bus Reset.  The reset thus no longer causes gratuitous slot
    bringdown and bringup.
    
    However the commits neglected to serialize reset with code paths reading
    slot registers.  For instance, a slot bringup due to an earlier hotplug
    event may see the Presence Detect State bit cleared during a concurrent
    Secondary Bus Reset.
    
    In 2018, commit
    
      5b3f7b7d062b ("PCI: pciehp: Avoid slot access during reset")
    
    retrofitted the missing locking.  It introduced a reset_lock which
    serializes a Secondary Bus Reset with other parts of pciehp.
    
    Unfortunately the locking turns out to be overzealous:  reset_lock is
    held for the entire enumeration and de-enumeration of hotplugged devices,
    including driver binding and unbinding.
    
    Driver binding and unbinding acquires device_lock while the reset_lock
    of the ancestral hotplug port is held.  A concurrent Secondary Bus Reset
    acquires the ancestral reset_lock while already holding the device_lock.
    The asymmetric locking order in the two code paths can lead to AB-BA
    deadlocks.
    
    Michael Haeuptle reports such deadlocks on simultaneous hot-removal and
    vfio release (the latter implies a Secondary Bus Reset):
    
      pciehp_ist()                                    # down_read(reset_lock)
        pciehp_handle_presence_or_link_change()
          pciehp_disable_slot()
            __pciehp_disable_slot()
              remove_board()
                pciehp_unconfigure_device()
                  pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device()
                    pci_stop_bus_device()
                      pci_stop_dev()
                        device_release_driver()
                          device_release_driver_internal()
                            __device_driver_lock()    # device_lock()
    
      SYS_munmap()
        vfio_device_fops_release()
          vfio_device_group_close()
            vfio_device_close()
              vfio_device_last_close()
                vfio_pci_core_close_device()
                  vfio_pci_core_disable()             # device_lock()
                    __pci_reset_function_locked()
                      pci_reset_bus_function()
                        pci_dev_reset_slot_function()
                          pci_reset_hotplug_slot()
                            pciehp_reset_slot()       # down_write(reset_lock)
    
    Ian May reports the same deadlock on simultaneous hot-removal and an
    AER-induced Secondary Bus Reset:
    
      aer_recover_work_func()
        pcie_do_recovery()
          aer_root_reset()
            pci_bus_error_reset()
              pci_slot_reset()
                pci_slot_lock()                       # device_lock()
                pci_reset_hotplug_slot()
                  pciehp_reset_slot()                 # down_write(reset_lock)
    
    Fix by releasing the reset_lock during driver binding and unbinding,
    thereby splitting and shrinking the critical section.
    
    Driver binding and unbinding is protected by the device_lock() and thus
    serialized with a Secondary Bus Reset.  There's no need to additionally
    protect it with the reset_lock.  However, pciehp does not bind and
    unbind devices directly, but rather invokes PCI core functions which
    also perform certain enumeration and de-enumeration steps.
    
    The reset_lock's purpose is to protect slot registers, not enumeration
    and de-enumeration of hotplugged devices.  That would arguably be the
    job of the PCI core, not the PCIe hotplug driver.  After all, an
    AER-induced Secondary Bus Reset may as well happen during boot-time
    enumeration of the PCI hierarchy and there's no locking to prevent that
    either.
    
    Exempting *de-enumeration* from the reset_lock is relatively harmless:
    A concurrent Secondary Bus Reset may foil config space accesses such as
    PME interrupt disablement.  But if the device is physically gone, those
    accesses are pointless anyway.  If the device is physically present and
    only logically removed through an Attention Button press or the sysfs
    "power" attribute, PME interrupts as well as DMA cannot come through
    because pciehp_unconfigure_device() disables INTx and Bus Master bits.
    That's still protected by the reset_lock in the present commit.
    
    Exempting *enumeration* from the reset_lock also has limited impact:
    The exempted call to pci_bus_add_device() may perform device accesses
    through pcibios_bus_add_device() and pci_fixup_device() which are now
    no longer protected from a concurrent Secondary Bus Reset.  Otherwise
    there should be no impact.
    
    In essence, the present commit seeks to fix the AB-BA deadlocks while
    still retaining a best-effort reset protection for enumeration and
    de-enumeration of hotplugged devices -- until a general solution is
    implemented in the PCI core.

    commit 085a9f43433f30cbe8a1ade62d9d7827c3217f4d upstream.
    
    Use down_read_nested() and down_write_nested() when taking the
    ctrl->reset_lock rw-sem, passing the number of PCIe hotplug controllers in
    the path to the PCI root bus as lock subclass parameter.
    
    This fixes the following false-positive lockdep report when unplugging a
    Lenovo X1C8 from a Lenovo 2nd gen TB3 dock:
    
      pcieport 0000:06:01.0: pciehp: Slot(1): Link Down

    This lockdep warning is triggered because with Thunderbolt, hotplug ports
    are nested. When removing multiple devices in a daisy-chain, each hotplug
    port's reset_lock may be acquired recursively. It's never the same lock, so
    the lockdep splat is a false positive.
    
    Because locks at the same hierarchy level are never acquired recursively, a
    per-level lockdep class is sufficient to fix the lockdep warning.
    
    The choice to use one lockdep subclass per pcie-hotplug controller in the
    path to the root-bus was made to conserve class keys because their number
    is limited and the complexity grows quadratically with number of keys
    according to Documentation/locking/lockdep-design.rst.

    drbd: correctly submit flush bio on barrier
    
    commit 3899d94e3831ee07ea6821c032dc297aec80586a upstream.
    
    When we receive a flush command (or "barrier" in DRBD), we currently use
    a REQ_OP_FLUSH with the REQ_PREFLUSH flag set.
    
    The correct way to submit a flush bio is by using a REQ_OP_WRITE without
    any data, and set the REQ_PREFLUSH flag.
    
    Since commit b4a6bb3a67aa ("block: add a sanity check for non-write
    flush/fua bios"), this triggers a warning in the block layer, but this
    has been broken for quite some time before that.
    
    So use the correct set of flags to actually make the flush happen.

    serial: 8250: Fix serial8250_tx_empty() race with DMA Tx
    
    There's a potential race before THRE/TEMT deasserts when DMA Tx is
    starting up (or the next batch of continuous Tx is being submitted).
    This can lead to misdetecting Tx empty condition.
    
    It is entirely normal for THRE/TEMT to be set for some time after the
    DMA Tx had been setup in serial8250_tx_dma(). As Tx side is definitely
    not empty at that point, it seems incorrect for serial8250_tx_empty()
    claim Tx is empty.
    
    Fix the race by also checking in serial8250_tx_empty() whether there's
    DMA Tx active.
    
    Note: This fix only addresses in-kernel race mainly to make using
    TCSADRAIN/FLUSH robust. Userspace can still cause other races but they
    seem userspace concurrency control problems.

    tty: Prevent writing chars during tcsetattr TCSADRAIN/FLUSH
    
    If userspace races tcsetattr() with a write, the drained condition
    might not be guaranteed by the kernel. There is a race window after
    checking Tx is empty before tty_set_termios() takes termios_rwsem for
    write. During that race window, more characters can be queued by a
    racing writer.
    
    Any ongoing transmission might produce garbage during HW's
    ->set_termios() call. The intent of TCSADRAIN/FLUSH seems to be
    preventing such a character corruption. If those flags are set, take
    tty's write lock to stop any writer before performing the lower layer
    Tx empty check and wait for the pending characters to be sent (if any).
    
    The initial wait for all-writers-done must be placed outside of tty's
    write lock to avoid deadlock which makes it impossible to use
    tty_wait_until_sent(). The write lock is retried if a racing write is
    detected.

    ext4: fix invalid free tracking in ext4_xattr_move_to_block()
    
    commit b87c7cdf2bed4928b899e1ce91ef0d147017ba45 upstream.
    
    In ext4_xattr_move_to_block(), the value of the extended attribute
    which we need to move to an external block may be allocated by
    kvmalloc() if the value is stored in an external inode.  So at the end
    of the function the code tried to check if this was the case by
    testing entry->e_value_inum.
    
    However, at this point, the pointer to the xattr entry is no longer
    valid, because it was removed from the original location where it had
    been stored.  So we could end up calling kvfree() on a pointer which
    was not allocated by kvmalloc(); or we could also potentially leak
    memory by not freeing the buffer when it should be freed.  Fix this by
    storing whether it should be freed in a separate variable.

    If a malicious fuzzer overwrites the ext4 superblock while it is
    mounted such that the s_first_data_block is set to a very large
    number, the calculation of the block group can underflow, and trigger
    a BUG_ON check.  Change this to be an ext4_warning so that we don't
    crash the kernel.

    ext4: add bounds checking in get_max_inline_xattr_value_size()
    
    commit 2220eaf90992c11d888fe771055d4de330385f01 upstream.
    
    Normally the extended attributes in the inode body would have been
    checked when the inode is first opened, but if someone is writing to
    the block device while the file system is mounted, it's possible for
    the inode table to get corrupted.  Add bounds checking to avoid
    reading beyond the end of allocated memory if this happens.

    ext4: improve error recovery code paths in __ext4_remount()
    
    commit 4c0b4818b1f636bc96359f7817a2d8bab6370162 upstream.
    
    If there are failures while changing the mount options in
    __ext4_remount(), we need to restore the old mount options.
    
    This commit fixes two problem.  The first is there is a chance that we
    will free the old quota file names before a potential failure leading
    to a use-after-free.  The second problem addressed in this commit is
    if there is a failed read/write to read-only transition, if the quota
    has already been suspended, we need to renable quota handling.

            le16_to_cpu(sbi->s_es->s_desc_size)
    with
            sbi->s_desc_size
    
    It reduces ext4's compiled text size, and makes the code more efficient
    (we remove an extra indirect reference and a potential byte
    swap on big endian systems), and there is no downside. It also avoids the
    potential KASAN / syzkaller failure, as a bonus.

    commit ab4f869fba6119997f7630d600049762a2b014fa upstream.
    
    This is the logical place to put the backlight device, and it also
    fixes a kernel crash if the MIPI host is removed. Previously the
    backlight device would be unregistered twice when this happened - once
    as a child of the MIPI host through `mipi_dsi_host_unregister`, and
    once when the panel device is destroyed.

    sh: nmi_debug: fix return value of __setup handler
    
    commit d1155e4132de712a9d3066e2667ceaad39a539c5 upstream.
    
    __setup() handlers should return 1 to obsolete_checksetup() in
    init/main.c to indicate that the boot option has been handled.
    A return of 0 causes the boot option/value to be listed as an Unknown
    kernel parameter and added to init's (limited) argument or environment
    strings. Also, error return codes don't mean anything to
    obsolete_checksetup() -- only non-zero (usually 1) or zero.
    So return 1 from nmi_debug_setup().

    btrfs: fix btrfs_prev_leaf() to not return the same key twice
    
    commit 6f932d4ef007d6a4ae03badcb749fbb8f49196f6 upstream.
    
    A call to btrfs_prev_leaf() may end up returning a path that points to the
    same item (key) again. This happens if while btrfs_prev_leaf(), after we
    release the path, a concurrent insertion happens, which moves items off
    from a sibling into the front of the previous leaf, and an item with the
    computed previous key does not exists.
    
    For example, suppose we have the two following leaves:
    
      Leaf A
    
      -------------------------------------------------------------
      | ...   key (300 96 10)   key (300 96 15)   key (300 96 16) |
      -------------------------------------------------------------
                  slot 20             slot 21             slot 22
    
      Leaf B
    
      -------------------------------------------------------------
      | key (300 96 20)   key (300 96 21)   key (300 96 22)   ... |
      -------------------------------------------------------------
          slot 0             slot 1             slot 2
    
    If we call btrfs_prev_leaf(), from btrfs_previous_item() for example, with
    a path pointing to leaf B and slot 0 and the following happens:
    
    1) At btrfs_prev_leaf() we compute the previous key to search as:
       (300 96 19), which is a key that does not exists in the tree;
    
    2) Then we call btrfs_release_path() at btrfs_prev_leaf();
    
    3) Some other task inserts a key at leaf A, that sorts before the key at
       slot 20, for example it has an objectid of 299. In order to make room
       for the new key, the key at slot 22 is moved to the front of leaf B.
       This happens at push_leaf_right(), called from split_leaf().
    
       After this leaf B now looks like:
    
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      | key (300 96 16)    key (300 96 20)   key (300 96 21)   key (300 96 22)   ... |
      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           slot 0              slot 1             slot 2             slot 3
    
    4) At btrfs_prev_leaf() we call btrfs_search_slot() for the computed
       previous key: (300 96 19). Since the key does not exists,
       btrfs_search_slot() returns 1 and with a path pointing to leaf B
       and slot 1, the item with key (300 96 20);
    
    5) This makes btrfs_prev_leaf() return a path that points to slot 1 of
       leaf B, the same key as before it was called, since the key at slot 0
       of leaf B (300 96 16) is less than the computed previous key, which is
       (300 96 19);
    
    6) As a consequence btrfs_previous_item() returns a path that points again
       to the item with key (300 96 20).
    
    For some users of btrfs_prev_leaf() or btrfs_previous_item() this may not
    be functional a problem, despite not making sense to return a new path
    pointing again to the same item/key. However for a caller such as
    tree-log.c:log_dir_items(), this has a bad consequence, as it can result
    in not logging some dir index deletions in case the directory is being
    logged without holding the inode's VFS lock (logging triggered while
    logging a child inode for example) - for the example scenario above, in
    case the dir index keys 17, 18 and 19 were deleted in the current
    transaction.

    perf map: Delete two variable initialisations before null pointer checks in sort__sym_from_cmp()
    
    [ Upstream commit c160118a90d4acf335993d8d59b02ae2147a524e ]
    
    Addresses of two data structure members were determined before
    corresponding null pointer checks in the implementation of the function
    “sort__sym_from_cmp”.
    
    Thus avoid the risk for undefined behaviour by removing extra
    initialisations for the local variables “from_l” and “from_r” (also
    because they were already reassigned with the same value behind this
    pointer check).
    
    This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.

    Given a master fd we can then override the priority of the context
    in another fd.
    
    Using these overrides was recommended by Christian instead of trying
    to submit from a master fd, and I am adding a way to override a
    single context instead of the entire process so we can only upgrade
    a single Vulkan queue and not effectively the entire process.
    
    Reused the flags field as it was checked to be 0 anyways, so nothing
    used it. This is source-incompatible (due to the name change), but

    af_packet: Don't send zero-byte data in packet_sendmsg_spkt().

    syzkaller reported a warning below [0].
    
    We can reproduce it by sending 0-byte data from the (AF_PACKET,
    SOCK_PACKET) socket via some devices whose dev->hard_header_len
    is 0.
    
        struct sockaddr_pkt addr = {
            .spkt_family = AF_PACKET,
            .spkt_device = "tun0",

        fd = socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_PACKET, 0);
        sendto(fd, NULL, 0, 0, (struct sockaddr *)&addr, sizeof(addr));
    
    We have a similar fix for the (AF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW) socket as
    commit dc633700f00f ("net/af_packet: check len when min_header_len
    equals to 0").
    
    Let's add the same test for the SOCK_PACKET socket.

    net/sched: act_mirred: Add carrier check
    
    [ Upstream commit 526f28bd0fbdc699cda31426928802650c1528e5 ]
    
    There are cases where the device is adminstratively UP, but operationally
    down. For example, we have a physical device (Nvidia ConnectX-6 Dx, 25Gbps)
    who's cable was pulled out, here is its ip link output:
    
    5: ens2f1: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
        link/ether b8:ce:f6:4b:68:35 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
        altname enp179s0f1np1
    
    As you can see, it's administratively UP but operationally down.
    In this case, sending a packet to this port caused a nasty kernel hang (so
    nasty that we were unable to capture it). Aborting a transmit based on
    operational status (in addition to administrative status) fixes the issue.

    relayfs: fix out-of-bounds access in relay_file_read
    
    [ Upstream commit 43ec16f1450f4936025a9bdf1a273affdb9732c1 ]
    
    There is a crash in relay_file_read, as the var from
    point to the end of last subbuf.
    
    The oops looks something like:
    pc : __arch_copy_to_user+0x180/0x310
    lr : relay_file_read+0x20c/0x2c8
    Call trace:
     __arch_copy_to_user+0x180/0x310
     full_proxy_read+0x68/0x98
     vfs_read+0xb0/0x1d0
     ksys_read+0x6c/0xf0
     __arm64_sys_read+0x20/0x28
     el0_svc_common.constprop.3+0x84/0x108
     do_el0_svc+0x74/0x90
     el0_svc+0x1c/0x28
     el0_sync_handler+0x88/0xb0
     el0_sync+0x148/0x180
    
    We get the condition by analyzing the vmcore:
    
    1). The last produced byte and last consumed byte
        both at the end of the last subbuf
    
    2). A softirq calls function(e.g __blk_add_trace)
        to write relay buffer occurs when an program is calling
        relay_file_read_avail().
    
            relay_file_read
                    relay_file_read_avail
                            relay_file_read_consume(buf, 0, 0);
                            //interrupted by softirq who will write subbuf
                            ....
                            return 1;

                    //avail is equal to subsize
                    avail = relay_file_read_subbuf_avail
                    //from  points to an invalid memory address

    [ Upstream commit 341a7213e5c1ce274cc0f02270054905800ea660 ]
    
    When reading, read_pos should start with bytes_consumed, not file->f_pos.
    Because when there is more than one reader, the read_pos corresponding to
    file->f_pos may have been consumed, which will cause the data that has
    been consumed to be read and the bytes_consumed update error.

    dm verity: fix error handling for check_at_most_once on FEC
    
    [ Upstream commit e8c5d45f82ce0c238a4817739892fe8897a3dcc3 ]
    
    In verity_end_io(), if bi_status is not BLK_STS_OK, it can be return
    directly. But if FEC configured, it is desired to correct the data page
    through verity_verify_io. And the return value will be converted to
    blk_status and passed to verity_finish_io().
    
    BTW, when a bit is set in v->validated_blocks, verity_verify_io() skips
    verification regardless of I/O error for the corresponding bio. In this
    case, the I/O error could not be returned properly, and as a result,
    there is a problem that abnormal data could be read for the
    corresponding block.
    
    To fix this problem, when an I/O error occurs, do not skip verification
    even if the bit related is set in v->validated_blocks.

    [ Upstream commit 2c0468e054c0adb660ac055fc396622ec7235df9 ]
    
    Without FEC, dm-verity won't call verity_handle_err() when I/O fails,
    but with FEC enabled, it currently does even if an I/O error has
    occurred.
    
    If there is an I/O error and FEC correction fails, return the error
    instead of calling verity_handle_err() again.

    ipmi: fix SSIF not responding under certain cond.
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d2555cde2918409b0331560e66f84a0ad4849c6 ]
    
    The ipmi communication is not restored after a specific version of BMC is
    upgraded on our server.
    The ipmi driver does not respond after printing the following log:
    
        ipmi_ssif: Invalid response getting flags: 1c 1
    
    I found that after entering this branch, ssif_info->ssif_state always
    holds SSIF_GETTING_FLAGS and never return to IDLE.
    
    As a result, the driver cannot be loaded, because the driver status is
    checked during the unload process and must be IDLE in shutdown_ssif():
    
            while (ssif_info->ssif_state != SSIF_IDLE)
                    schedule_timeout(1);
    
    The process trigger this problem is:
    
    1. One msg timeout and next msg start send, and call
    ssif_set_need_watch().
    
    2. ssif_set_need_watch()->watch_timeout()->start_flag_fetch() change
    ssif_state to SSIF_GETTING_FLAGS.
    
    3. In msg_done_handler() ssif_state == SSIF_GETTING_FLAGS, if an error
    message is received, the second branch does not modify the ssif_state.
    
    4. All retry action need IS_SSIF_IDLE() == True. Include retry action in
    watch_timeout(), msg_done_handler(). Sending msg does not work either.
    SSIF_IDLE is also checked in start_next_msg().
    
    5. The only thing that can be triggered in the SSIF driver is
    watch_timeout(), after destory_user(), this timer will stop too.
    
    So, if enter this branch, the ssif_state will remain SSIF_GETTING_FLAGS
    and can't send msg, no timer started, can't unload.
    
    We did a comparative test before and after adding this patch, and the
    result is effective.

    ipmi: Fix how the lower layers are told to watch for messages
    
    [ Upstream commit c65ea996595005be470fbfa16711deba414fd33b ]
    
    The IPMI driver has a mechanism to tell the lower layers it needs
    to watch for messages, commands, and watchdogs (so it doesn't
    needlessly poll).  However, it needed some extensions, it needed
    a way to tell what is being waited for so it could set the timeout
    appropriately.
    
    The update to the lower layer was also being done once a second
    at best because it was done in the main timeout handler.  However,
    if a command is sent and a response message is coming back,
    it needed to be started immediately.  So modify the code to
    update immediately if it needs to be enabled.  Disable is still
    lazy.

    Commit 89986496de141 ("ipmi: Turn off all activity on an idle ipmi
    interface") modified the IPMI code to only request events when the
    driver had somethine waiting for events.  The SSIF code, however,
    was using the event fetch request to also fetch the flags.
    
    Add a timer and the proper handling for the upper layer telling
    whether flags fetches are required.

    tick/nohz: Fix cpu_is_hotpluggable() by checking with nohz subsystem
    
    [ Upstream commit 58d7668242647e661a20efe065519abd6454287e ]
    
    For CONFIG_NO_HZ_FULL systems, the tick_do_timer_cpu cannot be offlined.
    However, cpu_is_hotpluggable() still returns true for those CPUs. This causes
    torture tests that do offlining to end up trying to offline this CPU causing
    test failures. Such failure happens on all architectures.
    
    Fix the repeated error messages thrown by this (even if the hotplug errors are
    harmless) by asking the opinion of the nohz subsystem on whether the CPU can be
    hotplugged.

    nohz: Add TICK_DEP_BIT_RCU
    
    [ Upstream commit 01b4c39901e087ceebae2733857248de81476bd8 ]
    
    If a nohz_full CPU is looping in the kernel, the scheduling-clock tick
    might nevertheless remain disabled.  In !PREEMPT kernels, this can
    prevent RCU's attempts to enlist the aid of that CPU's executions of
    cond_resched(), which can in turn result in an arbitrarily delayed grace
    period and thus an OOM.  RCU therefore needs a way to enable a holdout
    nohz_full CPU's scheduler-clock interrupt.
    
    This commit therefore provides a new TICK_DEP_BIT_RCU value which RCU can
    pass to tick_dep_set_cpu() and friends to force on the scheduler-clock
    interrupt for a specified CPU or task.  In some cases, rcutorture needs
    to turn on the scheduler-clock tick, so this commit also exports the
    relevant symbols to GPL-licensed modules.

    debugobject: Ensure pool refill (again)
    
    commit 0af462f19e635ad522f28981238334620881badc upstream.
    
    The recent fix to ensure atomicity of lookup and allocation inadvertently
    broke the pool refill mechanism.
    
    Prior to that change debug_objects_activate() and debug_objecs_assert_init()
    invoked debug_objecs_init() to set up the tracking object for statically
    initialized objects. That's not longer the case and debug_objecs_init() is
    now the only place which does pool refills.
    
    Depending on the number of statically initialized objects this can be
    enough to actually deplete the pool, which was observed by Ido via a
    debugobjects OOM warning.
    
    Restore the old behaviour by adding explicit refill opportunities to
    debug_objects_activate() and debug_objecs_assert_init().

    dm ioctl: fix nested locking in table_clear() to remove deadlock concern
    
    commit 3d32aaa7e66d5c1479a3c31d6c2c5d45dd0d3b89 upstream.
    
    syzkaller found the following problematic rwsem locking (with write
    lock already held):
    
     down_read+0x9d/0x450 kernel/locking/rwsem.c:1509
     dm_get_inactive_table+0x2b/0xc0 drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c:773
     __dev_status+0x4fd/0x7c0 drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c:844
     table_clear+0x197/0x280 drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c:1537
    
    In table_clear, it first acquires a write lock
    https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2/source/drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c#L1520
    down_write(&_hash_lock);
    
    Then before the lock is released at L1539, there is a path shown above:
    table_clear -> __dev_status -> dm_get_inactive_table ->  down_read
    https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.2/source/drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c#L773
    down_read(&_hash_lock);
    
    It tries to acquire the same read lock again, resulting in the deadlock
    problem.
    
    Fix this by moving table_clear()'s __dev_status() call to after its
    up_write(&_hash_lock);

    btrfs: scrub: reject unsupported scrub flags
    
    commit 604e6681e114d05a2e384c4d1e8ef81918037ef5 upstream.
    
    Since the introduction of scrub interface, the only flag that we support
    is BTRFS_SCRUB_READONLY.  Thus there is no sanity checks, if there are
    some undefined flags passed in, we just ignore them.
    
    This is problematic if we want to introduce new scrub flags, as we have
    no way to determine if such flags are supported.
    
    Address the problem by introducing a check for the flags, and if
    unsupported flags are set, return -EOPNOTSUPP to inform the user space.
    
    This check should be backported for all supported kernels before any new
    scrub flags are introduced.

    clk: rockchip: rk3399: allow clk_cifout to force clk_cifout_src to reparent
    
    commit 933bf364e152cd60902cf9585c2ba310d593e69f upstream.
    
    clk_cifout is derived from clk_cifout_src through an integer divider
    limited to 32. clk_cifout_src is a child of either cpll, gpll or npll
    without any possibility of a divider of any sort. The default clock
    parent is cpll.
    
    Let's allow clk_cifout to ask its parent clk_cifout_src to reparent in
    order to find the real closest possible rate for clk_cifout and not one
    derived from cpll only.

    wifi: rtl8xxxu: RTL8192EU always needs full init
    
    commit d46e04ccd40457a0119b76e11ab64a2ad403e138 upstream.
    
    Always run the entire init sequence (rtl8xxxu_init_device()) for
    RTL8192EU. It's what the vendor driver does too.
    
    This fixes a bug where the device is unable to connect after
    rebooting:
    
    wlp3s0f3u2: send auth to ... (try 1/3)
    wlp3s0f3u2: send auth to ... (try 2/3)
    wlp3s0f3u2: send auth to ... (try 3/3)
    wlp3s0f3u2: authentication with ... timed out
    
    Rebooting leaves the device powered on (partially? at least the
    firmware is still running), but not really in a working state.

    md/raid10: fix null-ptr-deref in raid10_sync_request
    
    commit a405c6f0229526160aa3f177f65e20c86fce84c5 upstream.
    
    init_resync() inits mempool and sets conf->have_replacemnt at the beginning
    of sync, close_sync() frees the mempool when sync is completed.
    
    After [1] recovery might be skipped and init_resync() is called but
    close_sync() is not. null-ptr-deref occurs with r10bio->dev[i].repl_bio.
    
    The following is one way to reproduce the issue.
    
      1) create a array, wait for resync to complete, mddev->recovery_cp is set
         to MaxSector.
      2) recovery is woken and it is skipped. conf->have_replacement is set to
         0 in init_resync(). close_sync() not called.
      3) some io errors and rdev A is set to WantReplacement.
      4) a new device is added and set to A's replacement.
      5) recovery is woken, A have replacement, but conf->have_replacemnt is
         0. r10bio->dev[i].repl_bio will not be alloced and null-ptr-deref
         occurs.
    
    Fix it by not calling init_resync() if recovery skipped.

    nilfs2: fix infinite loop in nilfs_mdt_get_block()
    
    commit a6a491c048882e7e424d407d32cba0b52d9ef2bf upstream.
    
    If the disk image that nilfs2 mounts is corrupted and a virtual block
    address obtained by block lookup for a metadata file is invalid,
    nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level() may return the same internal return code as
    -ENOENT, meaning the block does not exist in the metadata file.
    
    This duplication of return codes confuses nilfs_mdt_get_block(), causing
    it to read and create a metadata block indefinitely.
    
    In particular, if this happens to the inode metadata file, ifile,
    semaphore i_rwsem can be left held, causing task hangs in lock_mount.
    
    Fix this issue by making nilfs_bmap_lookup_at_level() treat virtual block
    address translation failures with -ENOENT as metadata corruption instead
    of returning the error code.

    nilfs2: do not write dirty data after degenerating to read-only
    
    commit 28a65b49eb53e172d23567005465019658bfdb4d upstream.
    
    According to syzbot's report, mark_buffer_dirty() called from
    nilfs_segctor_do_construct() outputs a warning with some patterns after
    nilfs2 detects metadata corruption and degrades to read-only mode.
    
    After such read-only degeneration, page cache data may be cleared through
    nilfs_clear_dirty_page() which may also clear the uptodate flag for their
    buffer heads.  However, even after the degeneration, log writes are still
    performed by unmount processing etc., which causes mark_buffer_dirty() to
    be called for buffer heads without the "uptodate" flag and causes the
    warning.
    
    Since any writes should not be done to a read-only file system in the
    first place, this fixes the warning in mark_buffer_dirty() by letting
    nilfs_segctor_do_construct() abort early if in read-only mode.
    
    This also changes the retry check of nilfs_segctor_write_out() to avoid
    unnecessary log write retries if it detects -EROFS that
    nilfs_segctor_do_construct() returned.

    [ Upstream commit 691d0b782066a6eeeecbfceb7910a8f6184e6105 ]
    
    Currently call_bind_status places a hard limit of 3 to the number of

    longer than 9 seconds to register with the port mapper after a restart.

    IB/hfi1: Fix SDMA mmu_rb_node not being evicted in LRU order
    
    [ Upstream commit 9fe8fec5e43d5a80f43cbf61aaada1b047a1eb61 ]
    
    hfi1_mmu_rb_remove_unless_exact() did not move mmu_rb_node objects in
    mmu_rb_handler->lru_list after getting a cache hit on an mmu_rb_node.
    
    As a result, hfi1_mmu_rb_evict() was not guaranteed to evict truly
    least-recently used nodes.
    
    This could be a performance issue for an application when that
    application:
    - Uses some long-lived buffers frequently.
    - Uses a large number of buffers once.
    - Hits the mmu_rb_handler cache size or pinned-page limits, forcing
      mmu_rb_handler cache entries to be evicted.
    
    In this case, the one-time use buffers cause the long-lived buffer
    entries to eventually filter to the end of the LRU list where
    hfi1_mmu_rb_evict() will consider evicting a frequently-used long-lived
    entry instead of evicting one of the one-time use entries.
    
    Fix this by inserting new mmu_rb_node at the tail of
    mmu_rb_handler->lru_list and move mmu_rb_ndoe to the tail of
    mmu_rb_handler->lru_list when the mmu_rb_node is a hit in
    hfi1_mmu_rb_remove_unless_exact(). Change hfi1_mmu_rb_evict() to evict
    from the head of mmu_rb_handler->lru_list instead of the tail.

    power: supply: generic-adc-battery: fix unit scaling
    
    [ Upstream commit 44263f50065969f2344808388bd589740f026167 ]
    
    power-supply properties are reported in µV, µA and µW.
    The IIO API provides mV, mA, mW, so the values need to
    be multiplied by 1000.

    RDMA/mlx4: Prevent shift wrapping in set_user_sq_size()
    
    [ Upstream commit d50b3c73f1ac20dabc53dc6e9d64ce9c79a331eb ]
    
    The ucmd->log_sq_bb_count variable is controlled by the user so this
    shift can wrap.  Fix it by using check_shl_overflow() in the same way
    that it was done in commit 515f60004ed9 ("RDMA/hns: Prevent undefined

    There is no need to check 'rdi->qp_dev' for NULL. The field 'qp_dev'
    is created in rvt_register_device() which will fail if the 'qp_dev'
    allocation fails in rvt_driver_qp_init(). Overwise this pointer
    doesn't changed and passed to rvt_qp_exit() by the next step.

    perf/core: Fix hardlockup failure caused by perf throttle
    
    [ Upstream commit 15def34e2635ab7e0e96f1bc32e1b69609f14942 ]
    
    commit e050e3f0a71bf ("perf: Fix broken interrupt rate throttling")
    introduces a change in throttling threshold judgment. Before this,
    compare hwc->interrupts and max_samples_per_tick, then increase
    hwc->interrupts by 1, but this commit reverses order of these two
    behaviors, causing the semantics of max_samples_per_tick to change.
    In literal sense of "max_samples_per_tick", if hwc->interrupts ==
    max_samples_per_tick, it should not be throttled, therefore, the judgment
    condition should be changed to "hwc->interrupts > max_samples_per_tick".
    
    In fact, this may cause the hardlockup to fail, The minimum value of
    max_samples_per_tick may be 1, in this case, the return value of
    __perf_event_account_interrupt function is 1.
    As a result, nmi_watchdog gets throttled, which would stop PMU (Use x86
    architecture as an example, see x86_pmu_handle_irq).

    powerpc/rtas: use memmove for potentially overlapping buffer copy
    
    [ Upstream commit 271208ee5e335cb1ad280d22784940daf7ddf820 ]
    
    Using memcpy() isn't safe when buf is identical to rtas_err_buf, which
    can happen during boot before slab is up. Full context which may not
    be obvious from the diff:
    
            if (altbuf) {
                    buf = altbuf;
            } else {
                    buf = rtas_err_buf;
                    if (slab_is_available())
                            buf = kmalloc(RTAS_ERROR_LOG_MAX, GFP_ATOMIC);
            }
            if (buf)
                    memcpy(buf, rtas_err_buf, RTAS_ERROR_LOG_MAX);
    
    This was found by inspection and I'm not aware of it causing problems
    in practice. It appears to have been introduced by commit
    033ef338b6e0 ("powerpc: Merge rtas.c into arch/powerpc/kernel"); the
    old ppc64 version of this code did not have this problem.

    spmi: Add a check for remove callback when removing a SPMI driver
    
    [ Upstream commit b56eef3e16d888883fefab47425036de80dd38fc ]
    
    When removing a SPMI driver, there can be a crash due to NULL pointer
    dereference if it does not have a remove callback defined. This is
    one such call trace observed when removing the QCOM SPMI PMIC driver:

    If a driver has all its resources allocated through devm_() APIs and
    does not need any other explicit cleanup, it would not require a
    remove callback to be defined. Hence, add a check for remove callback
    presence before calling it when removing a SPMI driver.

    [ Upstream commit 3fac2397f562eb669ddc2f45867a253f3fc26184 ]
    
    When loading the driver for rtl8192e, the W_DISABLE# switch is working as
    intended. But when the WLAN is turned off in software and then turned on
    again the W_DISABLE# does not work anymore. Reason for this is that in
    the function _rtl92e_dm_check_rf_ctrl_gpio() the bfirst_after_down is
    checked and returned when true. bfirst_after_down is set true when
    switching the WLAN off in software. But it is not set to false again
    when WLAN is turned on again.
    
    Add bfirst_after_down = false in _rtl92e_sta_up to reset bit and fix
    above described bug.

    sh: sq: Fix incorrect element size for allocating bitmap buffer
    
    [ Upstream commit 80f746e2bd0e1da3fdb49a53570e54a1a225faac ]
    
    The Store Queue code allocates a bitmap buffer with the size of
    multiple of sizeof(long) in sq_api_init(). While the buffer size
    is calculated correctly, the code uses the wrong element size to
    allocate the buffer which results in the allocated bitmap buffer
    being too small.
    
    Fix this by allocating the buffer with kcalloc() with element size
    sizeof(long) instead of kzalloc() whose elements size defaults to
    sizeof(char).

    uapi/linux/const.h: prefer ISO-friendly __typeof__
    
    [ Upstream commit 31088f6f7906253ef4577f6a9b84e2d42447dba0 ]
    
    typeof is (still) a GNU extension, which means that it cannot be used when
    building ISO C (e.g.  -std=c99).  It should therefore be avoided in uapi
    headers in favour of the ISO-friendly __typeof__.
    
    Unfortunately this issue could not be detected by
    CONFIG_UAPI_HEADER_TEST=y as the __ALIGN_KERNEL() macro is not expanded in
    any uapi header.
    
    This matters from a userspace perspective, not a kernel one. uapi
    headers and their contents are expected to be usable in a variety of
    situations, and in particular when building ISO C applications (with
    -std=c99 or similar).
    
    This particular problem can be reproduced by trying to use the
    __ALIGN_KERNEL macro directly in application code, say:
    
    #include <linux/const.h>
    
    int align(int x, int a)
    {
            return __KERNEL_ALIGN(x, a);
    }
    
    and trying to build that with -std=c99.

    of: Fix modalias string generation
    
    [ Upstream commit b19a4266c52de78496fe40f0b37580a3b762e67d ]
    
    The helper generating an OF based modalias (of_device_get_modalias())
    works fine, but due to the use of snprintf() internally it needs a
    buffer one byte longer than what should be needed just for the entire
    string (excluding the '\0'). Most users of this helper are sysfs hooks
    providing the modalias string to users. They all provide a PAGE_SIZE
    buffer which is way above the number of bytes required to fit the
    modalias string and hence do not suffer from this issue.
    
    There is another user though, of_device_request_module(), which is only
    called by drivers/usb/common/ulpi.c. This request module function is
    faulty, but maybe because in most cases there is an alternative, ULPI
    driver users have not noticed it.
    
    In this function, of_device_get_modalias() is called twice. The first
    time without buffer just to get the number of bytes required by the
    modalias string (excluding the null byte), and a second time, after
    buffer allocation, to fill the buffer. The allocation asks for an
    additional byte, in order to store the trailing '\0'. However, the
    buffer *length* provided to of_device_get_modalias() excludes this extra
    byte. The internal use of snprintf() with a length that is exactly the
    number of bytes to be written has the effect of using the last available
    byte to store a '\0', which then smashes the last character of the
    modalias string.
    
    Provide the actual size of the buffer to of_device_get_modalias() to fix
    this issue.
    
    Note: the "str[size - 1] = '\0';" line is not really needed as snprintf
    will anyway end the string with a null byte, but there is a possibility
    that this function might be called on a struct device_node without
    compatible, in this case snprintf() would not be executed. So we keep it
    just to avoid possible unbounded strings.

    Example thread interleaving that causes the general protection fault
    is as follows:
    
    CPU1 (vmci_host_poll)               CPU2 (vmci_host_do_init_context)
    -----                               -----
    // Read uninitialized context
    context = vmci_host_dev->context;
                                        // Initialize context
                                        vmci_host_dev->context = vmci_ctx_create();
                                        vmci_host_dev->ct_type = VMCIOBJ_CONTEXT;
    
    if (vmci_host_dev->ct_type == VMCIOBJ_CONTEXT) {
        // Dereferencing the wrong pointer
        poll_wait(..., &context->host_context);
    }
    
    In this scenario, vmci_host_poll() reads vmci_host_dev->context first,
    and then reads vmci_host_dev->ct_type to check that
    vmci_host_dev->context is initialized. However, since these two reads
    are not atomically executed, there is a chance of a race condition as
    described above.
    
    To fix this race condition, read vmci_host_dev->context after checking
    the value of vmci_host_dev->ct_type so that vmci_host_poll() always
    reads an initialized context.

    CPM has the same problem as QE so for CPM also use the fix added

      CPM mode uses Little Endian so words > 8 bits are byte swapped.
      Workaround this by always enforcing wordsize 8 for 16 and 32 bits
      words. Unfortunately this will not work for LSB transfers
      where wordsize is > 8 bits so disable these for now.
    
    Also limit the workaround to 16 and 32 bits words because it can
    only work for multiples of 8-bits.

    usb: gadget: udc: renesas_usb3: Fix use after free bug in renesas_usb3_remove due to race condition
    
    [ Upstream commit 2b947f8769be8b8181dc795fd292d3e7120f5204 ]
    
    In renesas_usb3_probe, role_work is bound with renesas_usb3_role_work.
    renesas_usb3_start will be called to start the work.
    
    If we remove the driver which will call usbhs_remove, there may be
    an unfinished work. The possible sequence is as follows:
    
    CPU0                                    CPU1
    
                                             renesas_usb3_role_work
    renesas_usb3_remove
    usb_role_switch_unregister
    device_unregister
    kfree(sw)
    //free usb3->role_sw
                                             usb_role_switch_set_role
                                             //use usb3->role_sw
    
    The usb3->role_sw could be freed under such circumstance and then
    used in usb_role_switch_set_role.
    
    This bug was found by static analysis. And note that removing a
    driver is a root-only operation, and should never happen in normal
    case. But the root user may directly remove the device which
    will also trigger the remove function.
    
    Fix it by canceling the work before cleanup in the renesas_usb3_remove.

    pstore: Revert pmsg_lock back to a normal mutex
    
    [ Upstream commit 5239a89b06d6b199f133bf0ffea421683187f257 ]
    
    This reverts commit 76d62f24db07f22ccf9bc18ca793c27d4ebef721.
    
    So while priority inversion on the pmsg_lock is an occasional
    problem that an rt_mutex would help with, in uses where logging
    is writing to pmsg heavily from multiple threads, the pmsg_lock
    can be heavily contended.
    
    After this change landed, it was reported that cases where the
    mutex locking overhead was commonly adding on the order of 10s
    of usecs delay had suddenly jumped to ~msec delay with rtmutex.
    
    It seems the slight differences in the locks under this level
    of contention causes the normal mutexes to utilize the spinning
    optimizations, while the rtmutexes end up in the sleeping
    slowpath (which allows additional threads to pile on trying
    to take the lock).
    
    In this case, it devolves to a worse case senerio where the lock
    acquisition and scheduling overhead dominates, and each thread
    is waiting on the order of ~ms to do ~us of work.
    
    Obviously, having tons of threads all contending on a single
    lock for logging is non-optimal, so the proper fix is probably
    reworking pstore pmsg to have per-cpu buffers so we don't have
    contention.
    
    Additionally, Steven Rostedt has provided some furhter
    optimizations for rtmutexes that improves the rtmutex spinning
    path, but at least in my testing, I still see the test tripping
    into the sleeping path on rtmutexes while utilizing the spinning
    path with mutexes.
    
    But in the short term, lets revert the change to the rt_mutex
    and go back to normal mutexes to avoid a potentially major
    performance regression. And we can work on optimizations to both
    rtmutexes and finer-grained locking for pstore pmsg in the
    future.

    tcp/udp: Fix memleaks of sk and zerocopy skbs with TX timestamp.
    
    [ Upstream commit 50749f2dd6854a41830996ad302aef2ffaf011d8 ]
    
    syzkaller reported [0] memory leaks of an UDP socket and ZEROCOPY
    skbs.  We can reproduce the problem with these sequences:
    
      sk = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0)
      sk.setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_TIMESTAMPING, SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_SOFTWARE)
      sk.setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_ZEROCOPY, 1)
      sk.sendto(b'', MSG_ZEROCOPY, ('127.0.0.1', 53))
      sk.close()
    
    sendmsg() calls msg_zerocopy_alloc(), which allocates a skb, sets
    skb->cb->ubuf.refcnt to 1, and calls sock_hold().  Here, struct
    ubuf_info_msgzc indirectly holds a refcnt of the socket.  When the
    skb is sent, __skb_tstamp_tx() clones it and puts the clone into
    the socket's error queue with the TX timestamp.
    
    When the original skb is received locally, skb_copy_ubufs() calls
    skb_unclone(), and pskb_expand_head() increments skb->cb->ubuf.refcnt.
    This additional count is decremented while freeing the skb, but struct
    ubuf_info_msgzc still has a refcnt, so __msg_zerocopy_callback() is
    not called.
    
    The last refcnt is not released unless we retrieve the TX timestamped
    skb by recvmsg().  Since we clear the error queue in inet_sock_destruct()
    after the socket's refcnt reaches 0, there is a circular dependency.
    If we close() the socket holding such skbs, we never call sock_put()
    and leak the count, sk, and skb.
    
    TCP has the same problem, and commit e0c8bccd40fc ("net: stream:
    purge sk_error_queue in sk_stream_kill_queues()") tried to fix it
    by calling skb_queue_purge() during close().  However, there is a
    small chance that skb queued in a qdisc or device could be put
    into the error queue after the skb_queue_purge() call.
    
    In __skb_tstamp_tx(), the cloned skb should not have a reference
    to the ubuf to remove the circular dependency, but skb_clone() does
    not call skb_copy_ubufs() for zerocopy skb.  So, we need to call
    skb_orphan_frags_rx() for the cloned skb to call skb_copy_ubufs().

    net: amd: Fix link leak when verifying config failed
    
    [ Upstream commit d325c34d9e7e38d371c0a299d415e9b07f66a1fb ]
    
    After failing to verify configuration, it returns directly without
    releasing link, which may cause memory leak.
    
    Paolo Abeni thinks that the whole code of this driver is quite
    "suboptimal" and looks unmainatained since at least ~15y, so he
    suggests that we could simply remove the whole driver, please
    take it into consideration.
    
    Simon Horman suggests that the fix label should be set to
    "Linux-2.6.12-rc2" considering that the problem has existed
    since the driver was introduced and the commit above doesn't
    seem to exist in net/net-next.

    netlink: Use copy_to_user() for optval in netlink_getsockopt().
    
    [ Upstream commit d913d32cc2707e9cd24fe6fa6d7d470e9c728980 ]
    
    Brad Spencer provided a detailed report [0] that when calling getsockopt()
    for AF_NETLINK, some SOL_NETLINK options set only 1 byte even though such
    options require at least sizeof(int) as length.
    
    The options return a flag value that fits into 1 byte, but such behaviour
    confuses users who do not initialise the variable before calling
    getsockopt() and do not strictly check the returned value as char.
    
    Currently, netlink_getsockopt() uses put_user() to copy data to optlen and
    optval, but put_user() casts the data based on the pointer, char *optval.
    As a result, only 1 byte is set to optval.
    
    To avoid this behaviour, we need to use copy_to_user() or cast optval for
    put_user().
    
    Note that this changes the behaviour on big-endian systems, but we document
    that the size of optval is int in the man page.
    
      $ man 7 netlink
      ...
      Socket options

    ixgbe: Enable setting RSS table to default values
    
    [ Upstream commit e85d3d55875f7a1079edfbc4e4e98d6f8aea9ac7 ]
    
    ethtool uses `ETHTOOL_GRXRINGS` to compute how many queues are supported
    by RSS. The driver should return the smaller of either:
      - The maximum number of RSS queues the device supports, OR
      - The number of RX queues configured
    
    Prior to this change, running `ethtool -X $iface default` fails if the
    number of queues configured is larger than the number supported by RSS,
    even though changing the queue count correctly resets the flowhash to
    use all supported queues.
    
    Other drivers (for example, i40e) will succeed but the flow hash will
    reset to support the maximum number of queues supported by RSS, even if
    that amount is smaller than the configured amount.
    
    Prior to this change:
    
    $ sudo ethtool -L eth1 combined 20
    $ sudo ethtool -x eth1
    RX flow hash indirection table for eth1 with 20 RX ring(s):
        0:      0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7
        8:      8     9    10    11    12    13    14    15
       16:      0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7
       24:      8     9    10    11    12    13    14    15
       32:      0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7
    ...
    
    You can see that the flowhash was correctly set to use the maximum
    number of queues supported by the driver (16).
    
    However, asking the NIC to reset to "default" fails:
    
    $ sudo ethtool -X eth1 default
    Cannot set RX flow hash configuration: Invalid argument
    
    After this change, the flowhash can be reset to default which will use
    all of the available RSS queues (16) or the configured queue count,
    whichever is smaller.
    
    Starting with eth1 which has 10 queues and a flowhash distributing to
    all 10 queues:
    
    $ sudo ethtool -x eth1
    RX flow hash indirection table for eth1 with 10 RX ring(s):
        0:      0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7
        8:      8     9     0     1     2     3     4     5
       16:      6     7     8     9     0     1     2     3
    ...
    
    Increasing the queue count to 48 resets the flowhash to distribute to 16
    queues, as it did before this patch:
    
    $ sudo ethtool -L eth1 combined 48
    $ sudo ethtool -x eth1
    RX flow hash indirection table for eth1 with 16 RX ring(s):
        0:      0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7
        8:      8     9    10    11    12    13    14    15
       16:      0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7
    ...
    
    Due to the other bugfix in this series, the flowhash can be set to use
    queues 0-5:
    
    $ sudo ethtool -X eth1 equal 5
    $ sudo ethtool -x eth1
    RX flow hash indirection table for eth1 with 16 RX ring(s):
        0:      0     1     2     3     4     0     1     2
        8:      3     4     0     1     2     3     4     0
       16:      1     2     3     4     0     1     2     3
    ...
    
    Due to this bugfix, the flowhash can be reset to default and use 16
    queues:
    
    $ sudo ethtool -X eth1 default
    $ sudo ethtool -x eth1
    RX flow hash indirection table for eth1 with 16 RX ring(s):
        0:      0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7
        8:      8     9    10    11    12    13    14    15
       16:      0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7

    ixgbe: Allow flow hash to be set via ethtool
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f3ed1293feb9502dc254b05802faf1ad3317ac6 ]
    
    ixgbe currently returns `EINVAL` whenever the flowhash it set by ethtool
    because the ethtool code in the kernel passes a non-zero value for hfunc
    that ixgbe should allow.
    
    When ethtool is called with `ETHTOOL_SRXFHINDIR`,
    `ethtool_set_rxfh_indir` will call ixgbe's set_rxfh function
    with `ETH_RSS_HASH_NO_CHANGE`. This value should be accepted.
    
    When ethtool is called with `ETHTOOL_SRSSH`, `ethtool_set_rxfh` will
    call ixgbe's set_rxfh function with `rxfh.hfunc`, which appears to be
    hardcoded in ixgbe to always be `ETH_RSS_HASH_TOP`. This value should
    also be accepted.

    bpftool: Fix bug for long instructions in program CFG dumps
    
    [ Upstream commit 67cf52cdb6c8fa6365d29106555dacf95c9fd374 ]
    
    When dumping the control flow graphs for programs using the 16-byte long
    load instruction, we need to skip the second part of this instruction
    when looking for the next instruction to process. Otherwise, we end up
    printing "BUG_ld_00" from the kernel disassembler in the CFG.

    scm: fix MSG_CTRUNC setting condition for SO_PASSSEC
    
    [ Upstream commit a02d83f9947d8f71904eda4de046630c3eb6802c ]
    
    Currently, kernel would set MSG_CTRUNC flag if msg_control buffer
    wasn't provided and SO_PASSCRED was set or if there was pending SCM_RIGHTS.
    
    For some reason we have no corresponding check for SO_PASSSEC.
    
    In the recvmsg(2) doc we have:
           MSG_CTRUNC
                  indicates that some control data was discarded due to lack
                  of space in the buffer for ancillary data.
    
    So, we need to set MSG_CTRUNC flag for all types of SCM.
    
    This change can break applications those don't check MSG_CTRUNC flag.

    tools: bpftool: Remove invalid \' json escape
    
    [ Upstream commit c679bbd611c08b0559ffae079330bc4e5574696a ]
    
    RFC8259 ("The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Data Interchange
    Format") only specifies \", \\, \/, \b, \f, \n, \r, and \r as valid
    two-character escape sequences. This does not include \', which is not
    required in JSON because it exclusively uses double quotes as string
    separators.
    
    Solidus (/) may be escaped, but does not have to. Only reverse
    solidus (\), double quotes ("), and the control characters have to be
    escaped. Therefore, with this fix, bpftool correctly supports all valid
    two-character escape sequences (but still does not support characters
    that require multi-character escape sequences).
    
    Witout this fix, attempting to load a JSON file generated by bpftool
    using Python 3.10.6's default json.load() may fail with the error
    "Invalid \escape" if the file contains the invalid escaped single
    quote (\').

    [ Upstream commit 7654cc03eb699297130b693ec34e25f77b17c947 ]
    
    hif_dev->remain_skb is allocated and used exclusively in
    ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream(). It is implied that an allocated remain_skb is
    processed and subsequently freed (in error paths) only during the next
    call of ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().
    
    So, if the urbs are deallocated between those two calls due to the device
    deinitialization or suspend, it is possible that ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream()
    is not called next time and the allocated remain_skb is leaked. Our local
    Syzkaller instance was able to trigger that.
    
    remain_skb makes sense when receiving two consecutive urbs which are
    logically linked together, i.e. a specific data field from the first skb
    indicates a cached skb to be allocated, memcpy'd with some data and
    subsequently processed in the next call to ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream(). Urbs
    deallocation supposedly makes that link irrelevant so we need to free the
    cached skb in those cases.
    
    Fix the leak by introducing a function to explicitly free remain_skb (if
    it is not NULL) when the rx urbs have been deallocated. remain_skb is NULL
    when it has not been allocated at all (hif_dev struct is kzalloced) or
    when it has been processed in next call to ath9k_hif_usb_rx_stream().

    debugobject: Prevent init race with static objects
    
    [ Upstream commit 63a759694eed61025713b3e14dd827c8548daadc ]
    
    Statically initialized objects are usually not initialized via the init()
    function of the subsystem. They are special cased and the subsystem
    provides a function to validate whether an object which is not yet tracked
    by debugobjects is statically initialized. This means the object is started
    to be tracked on first use, e.g. activation.
    
    This works perfectly fine, unless there are two concurrent operations on
    that object. Schspa decoded the problem:
    
    T0                                  T1
    
    debug_object_assert_init(addr)
      lock_hash_bucket()
      obj = lookup_object(addr);
      if (!obj) {

    This race exists forever, but was never observed until mod_timer() got a
    debug_object_assert_init() added which is outside of the timer base lock
    held section right at the beginning of the function to cover the lockless
    early exit points too.
    
    Rework the code so that the lookup, the static object check and the
    tracking object association happens atomically under the hash bucket
    lock. This prevents the issue completely as all callers are serialized on
    the hash bucket lock and therefore cannot observe inconsistent state.

    debugobjects: Move printk out of db->lock critical sections
    
    [ Upstream commit d5f34153e526903abe71869dbbc898bfc0f69373 ]
    
    The db->lock is a raw spinlock and so the lock hold time is supposed
    to be short. This will not be the case when printk() is being involved
    in some of the critical sections. In order to avoid the long hold time,
    in case some messages need to be printed, the debug_object_is_on_stack()
    and debug_print_object() calls are now moved out of those critical
    sections.

    debugobjects: Add percpu free pools
    
    [ Upstream commit d86998b17a01050c0232231fa481e65ef8171ca6 ]
    
    When a multi-threaded workload does a lot of small memory object
    allocations and deallocations, it may cause the allocation and freeing of
    many debug objects. This will make the global pool_lock a bottleneck in the
    performance of the workload.  Since interrupts are disabled when acquiring
    the pool_lock, it may even cause hard lockups to happen.
    
    To reduce contention of the global pool_lock, add a percpu debug object
    free pool that can be used to buffer some of the debug object allocation
    and freeing requests without acquiring the pool_lock.  Each CPU will now
    have a percpu free pool that can hold up to a maximum of 64 debug
    objects. Allocation and freeing requests will go to the percpu free pool
    first. If that fails, the pool_lock will be taken and the global free pool
    will be used.
    
    The presence or absence of obj_cache is used as a marker to see if the
    percpu cache should be used.

    arm64: kgdb: Set PSTATE.SS to 1 to re-enable single-step
    
    [ Upstream commit af6c0bd59f4f3ad5daad2f7b777954b1954551d5 ]
    
    Currently only the first attempt to single-step has any effect. After
    that all further stepping remains "stuck" at the same program counter
    value.
    
    Refer to the ARM Architecture Reference Manual (ARM DDI 0487E.a) D2.12,
    PSTATE.SS=1 should be set at each step before transferring the PE to the
    'Active-not-pending' state. The problem here is PSTATE.SS=1 is not set
    since the second single-step.
    
    After the first single-step, the PE transferes to the 'Inactive' state,
    with PSTATE.SS=0 and MDSCR.SS=1, thus PSTATE.SS won't be set to 1 due to
    kernel_active_single_step()=true. Then the PE transferes to the
    'Active-pending' state when ERET and returns to the debugger by step
    exception.

    x86/ioapic: Don't return 0 from arch_dynirq_lower_bound()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5af507bef93c09a94fb8f058213b489178f4cbe5 ]
    
    arch_dynirq_lower_bound() is invoked by the core interrupt code to
    retrieve the lowest possible Linux interrupt number for dynamically
    allocated interrupts like MSI.
    
    The x86 implementation uses this to exclude the IO/APIC GSI space.
    This works correctly as long as there is an IO/APIC registered, but
    returns 0 if not. This has been observed in VMs where the BIOS does
    not advertise an IO/APIC.
    
    0 is an invalid interrupt number except for the legacy timer interrupt
    on x86. The return value is unchecked in the core code, so it ends up
    to allocate interrupt number 0 which is subsequently considered to be
    invalid by the caller, e.g. the MSI allocation code.
    
    The function has already a check for 0 in the case that an IO/APIC is
    registered, as ioapic_dynirq_base is 0 in case of device tree setups.
    
    Consolidate this and zero check for both ioapic_dynirq_base and gsi_top,
    which is used in the case that no IO/APIC is registered.

    [ Upstream commit 9c592f8ab114875fdb3b2040f01818e53de44991 ]
    
    The driver was intended from the start to be a wake-up source for the
    system, however due to the absence of a suitable call to
    device_set_wakeup_capable(), the device_may_wakeup() call used to decide
    whether to enable the GPIO interrupt as a wake-up source would never
    happen. Lookup the DT standard "wakeup-source" property and call
    device_init_wakeup() to ensure the device is flagged as being wakeup
    capable.

    The detection of atomic update failure in reserve_eilvt_offset() is
    not correct. The value returned by atomic_cmpxchg() should be compared
    to the old value from the location to be updated.
    
    If these two are the same, then atomic update succeeded and
    "eilvt_offsets[offset]" location is updated to "new" in an atomic way.
    
    Otherwise, the atomic update failed and it should be retried with the
    value from "eilvt_offsets[offset]" - exactly what atomic_try_cmpxchg()
    does in a correct and more optimal way.

    drm/msm/adreno: drop bogus pm_runtime_set_active()
    
    [ Upstream commit db7662d076c973072d788bd0e8130e04430307a1 ]
    
    The runtime PM status can only be updated while runtime PM is disabled.
    
    Drop the bogus pm_runtime_set_active() call that was made after enabling
    runtime PM and which (incidentally but correctly) left the runtime PM
    status set to 'suspended'.

    drm/msm/adreno: Defer enabling runpm until hw_init()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4b18299b33655fa9672b774b6df774dc03d6aee8 ]
    
    To avoid preventing the display from coming up before the rootfs is
    mounted, without resorting to packing fw in the initrd, the GPU has
    this limbo state where the device is probed, but we aren't ready to
    start sending commands to it.  This is particularly problematic for
    a6xx, since the GMU (which requires fw to be loaded) is the one that
    is controlling the power/clk/icc votes.
    
    So defer enabling runpm until we are ready to call gpu->hw_init(),
    as that is a point where we know we have all the needed fw and are
    ready to start sending commands to the coproc's.

    [ Upstream commit eed9496a0501357aa326ddd6b71408189ed872eb ]
    
    The buf[4] value comes from the user via ts_play().  It is a value in
    the u8 range.  The final length we pass to av7110_ipack_instant_repack()
    is "len - (buf[4] + 1) - 4" so add a check to ensure that the length is
    not negative.  It's not clear that passing a negative len value does
    anything bad necessarily, but it's not best practice.
    
    With the new bounds checking the "if (!len)" condition is no longer
    possible or required so remove that.

    EDAC/skx: Fix overflows on the DRAM row address mapping arrays
    
    [ Upstream commit 71b1e3ba3fed5a34c5fac6d3a15c2634b04c1eb7 ]
    
    The current DRAM row address mapping arrays skx_{open,close}_row[]
    only support ranks with sizes up to 16G. Decoding a rank address
    to a DRAM row address for a 32G rank by using either one of the
    above arrays by the skx_edac driver, will result in an overflow on
    the array.
    
    For a 32G rank, the most significant DRAM row address bit (the
    bit17) is mapped from the bit34 of the rank address. Add this new
    mapping item to both arrays to fix the overflow issue.

    [ Upstream commit a8e47884f1906cd7440fafa056adc8817568e73e ]
    
    Currently we schedule a call to output_poll_execute from
    drm_kms_helper_poll_enable for 10s in future. Later we try to replace
    that in drm_helper_probe_single_connector_modes with a 0s schedule with
    delayed_event set.
    
    But as there is already a job in the queue this fails, and the immediate
    job we wanted with delayed_event set doesn't occur until 10s later.
    
    And that call acts as if connector state has changed, reprobing modes.
    This has a side effect of waking up a display that has been blanked.
    
    Make sure we cancel the old job before submitting the immediate one.

    ubifs: Free memory for tmpfile name
    
    commit 1fb815b38bb31d6af9bd0540b8652a0d6fe6cfd3 upstream.
    
    When opening a ubifs tmpfile on an encrypted directory, function

    stored in the directory entry, but after the name has been copied to the
    directory entry inode, the memory is not freed.
    
    When running kmemleak on it we see that it is registered as a leak. The
    report below is triggered by a simple program 'tmpfile' just opening a
    tmpfile:

    adds helper function, try_write_vid_and_data(), to simplify the code, but this
    helper function has bug, it will return 0 (success) when ubi_io_write_vid_hdr()
    or the ubi_io_write_data() return error number (-EIO, etc), because the return
    value of ubi_wl_put_peb() will overwrite the original return value.
    
    This issue will cause unexpected data loss issue, because the caller of this
    function and UBIFS willn't know the data is lost.

    ubifs: Fix memleak when insert_old_idx() failed
    
    commit b5fda08ef213352ac2df7447611eb4d383cce929 upstream.
    
    Following process will cause a memleak for copied up znode:
    
    dirty_cow_znode
      zn = copy_znode(c, znode);
      err = insert_old_idx(c, zbr->lnum, zbr->offs);
      if (unlikely(err))
         return ERR_PTR(err);   // No one refers to zn.
    
    Fetch a reproducer in [Link].
    
    Function copy_znode() is split into 2 parts: resource allocation
    and znode replacement, insert_old_idx() is split in similar way,
    so resource cleanup could be done in error handling path without
    corrupting metadata(mem & disk).
    It's okay that old index inserting is put behind of add_idx_dirt(),
    old index is used in layout_leb_in_gaps(), so the two processes do
    not depend on each other.

    commit 7d01cb27f6aebc54efbe28d8961a973b8f795b13 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 122deabfe1428 (ubifs: dirty_cow_znode: Fix memleak
    in error handling path).
    After commit 122deabfe1428 applied, if insert_old_idx() failed, old
    index neither exists in TNC nor in old-index tree. Which means that

    i2c: omap: Fix standard mode false ACK readings
    
    commit c770657bd2611b077ec1e7b1fe6aa92f249399bd upstream.
    
    Using standard mode, rare false ACK responses were appearing with
    i2cdetect tool. This was happening due to NACK interrupt triggering
    ISR thread before register access interrupt was ready. Removing the
    NACK interrupt's ability to trigger ISR thread lets register access
    ready interrupt do this instead.

    KVM: nVMX: Emulate NOPs in L2, and PAUSE if it's not intercepted
    
    commit 4984563823f0034d3533854c1b50e729f5191089 upstream.
    
    Extend VMX's nested intercept logic for emulated instructions to handle
    "pause" interception, in quotes because KVM's emulator doesn't filter out
    NOPs when checking for nested intercepts.  Failure to allow emulation of
    NOPs results in KVM injecting a #UD into L2 on any NOP that collides with
    the emulator's definition of PAUSE, i.e. on all single-byte NOPs.
    
    For PAUSE itself, honor L1's PAUSE-exiting control, but ignore PLE to
    avoid unnecessarily injecting a #UD into L2.  Per the SDM, the first
    execution of PAUSE after VM-Entry is treated as the beginning of a new
    loop, i.e. will never trigger a PLE VM-Exit, and so L1 can't expect any
    given execution of PAUSE to deterministically exit.
    
      ... the processor considers this execution to be the first execution of
      PAUSE in a loop. (It also does so for the first execution of PAUSE at
      CPL 0 after VM entry.)
    
    All that said, the PLE side of things is currently a moot point, as KVM
    doesn't expose PLE to L1.
    
    Note, vmx_check_intercept() is still wildly broken when L1 wants to
    intercept an instruction, as KVM injects a #UD instead of synthesizing a
    nested VM-Exit.  That issue extends far beyond NOP/PAUSE and needs far
    more effort to fix, i.e. is a problem for the future.

    reiserfs: Add security prefix to xattr name in reiserfs_security_write()
    
    commit d82dcd9e21b77d338dc4875f3d4111f0db314a7c upstream.
    
    Reiserfs sets a security xattr at inode creation time in two stages: first,
    it calls reiserfs_security_init() to obtain the xattr from active LSMs;
    then, it calls reiserfs_security_write() to actually write that xattr.
    
    Unfortunately, it seems there is a wrong expectation that LSMs provide the
    full xattr name in the form 'security.<suffix>'. However, LSMs always
    provided just the suffix, causing reiserfs to not write the xattr at all
    (if the suffix is shorter than the prefix), or to write an xattr with the
    wrong name.
    
    Add a temporary buffer in reiserfs_security_write(), and write to it the
    full xattr name, before passing it to reiserfs_xattr_set_handle().
    
    Also replace the name length check with a check that the full xattr name is
    not larger than XATTR_NAME_MAX.

    ring-buffer: Sync IRQ works before buffer destruction
    
    commit 675751bb20634f981498c7d66161584080cc061e upstream.
    
    If something was written to the buffer just before destruction,
    it may be possible (maybe not in a real system, but it did
    happen in ARCH=um with time-travel) to destroy the ringbuffer
    before the IRQ work ran, leading this KASAN report (or a crash
    without KASAN):

    debugfs: regset32: Add Runtime PM support
    
    commit 30332eeefec8f83afcea00c360f99ef64b87f220 upstream.
    
    Hardware registers of devices under control of power management cannot
    be accessed at all times.  If such a device is suspended, register
    accesses may lead to undefined behavior, like reading bogus values, or
    causing exceptions or system lock-ups.
    
    Extend struct debugfs_regset32 with an optional field to let device
    drivers specify the device the registers in the set belong to.  This
    allows debugfs_show_regset32() to make sure the device is resumed while
    its registers are being read.

    bluetooth: Perform careful capability checks in hci_sock_ioctl()
    
    commit 25c150ac103a4ebeed0319994c742a90634ddf18 upstream.
    
    Previously, capability was checked using capable(), which verified that the
    caller of the ioctl system call had the required capability. In addition,
    the result of the check would be stored in the HCI_SOCK_TRUSTED flag,
    making it persistent for the socket.
    
    However, malicious programs can abuse this approach by deliberately sharing
    an HCI socket with a privileged task. The HCI socket will be marked as
    trusted when the privileged task occasionally makes an ioctl call.
    
    This problem can be solved by using sk_capable() to check capability, which
    ensures that not only the current task but also the socket opener has the
    specified capability, thus reducing the risk of privilege escalation
    through the previously identified vulnerability.

    wifi: brcmfmac: slab-out-of-bounds read in brcmf_get_assoc_ies()
    
    commit 0da40e018fd034d87c9460123fa7f897b69fdee7 upstream.
    
    Fix a slab-out-of-bounds read that occurs in kmemdup() called from
    brcmf_get_assoc_ies().
    The bug could occur when assoc_info->req_len, data from a URB provided
    by a USB device, is bigger than the size of buffer which is defined as
    WL_EXTRA_BUF_MAX.
    
    Add the size check for req_len/resp_len of assoc_info.
    
    Found by a modified version of syzkaller.
