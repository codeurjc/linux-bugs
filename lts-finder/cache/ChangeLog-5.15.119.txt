    x86/apic: Fix kernel panic when booting with intremap=off and x2apic_phys
    
    [ Upstream commit 85d38d5810e285d5aec7fb5283107d1da70c12a9 ]
    
    When booting with "intremap=off" and "x2apic_phys" on the kernel command
    line, the physical x2APIC driver ends up being used even when x2APIC
    mode is disabled ("intremap=off" disables x2APIC mode). This happens
    because the first compound condition check in x2apic_phys_probe() is
    false due to x2apic_mode == 0 and so the following one returns true
    after default_acpi_madt_oem_check() having already selected the physical
    x2APIC driver.
    
    This results in the following panic:

    [ Upstream commit 20a99a291d564a559cc2fd013b4824a3bb3f1db7 ]
    
    Some devices have a wrong entry in their button array which points to
    a GPIO which is required in another driver, so soc_button_array must
    not claim it.
    
    A specific example of this is the Lenovo Yoga Book X90F / X90L,
    where the PNP0C40 home button entry points to a GPIO which is not
    a home button and which is required by the lenovo-yogabook driver.
    
    Add a DMI quirk table which can specify an ACPI GPIO resource index which
    should be skipped; and add an entry for the Lenovo Yoga Book X90F / X90L
    to this new DMI quirk table.

    nvme: double KA polling frequency to avoid KATO with TBKAS on
    
    [ Upstream commit ea4d453b9ec9ea279c39744cd0ecb47ef48ede35 ]
    
    With TBKAS on, the completion of one command can defer sending a
    keep alive for up to twice the delay between successive runs of
    nvme_keep_alive_work. The current delay of KATO / 2 thus makes it
    possible for one command to defer sending a keep alive for up to
    KATO, which can result in the controller detecting a KATO. The following
    trace demonstrates the issue, taking KATO = 8 for simplicity:
    
    1. t = 0: run nvme_keep_alive_work, no keep-alive sent
    2. t = ε: I/O completion seen, set comp_seen = true
    3. t = 4: run nvme_keep_alive_work, see comp_seen == true,
              skip sending keep-alive, set comp_seen = false
    4. t = 8: run nvme_keep_alive_work, see comp_seen == false,
              send a keep-alive command.
    
    Here, there is a delay of 8 - ε between receiving a command completion
    and sending the next command. With ε small, the controller is likely to
    detect a keep alive timeout.
    
    Fix this by running nvme_keep_alive_work with a delay of KATO / 4
    whenever TBKAS is on. Going through the above trace now gives us a
    worst-case delay of 4 - ε, which is in line with the recommendation of
    sending a command every KATO / 2 in the NVMe specification.

    When a message was received the last_initiator is set to 0xff.
    This will force the signal free time for the next transmit
    to that for a new initiator. However, if a new transmit is
    already in progress, then don't set last_initiator, since
    that's the initiator of the current transmit. Overwriting
    this would cause the signal free time of a following transmit

    scsi: target: iscsi: Prevent login threads from racing between each other
    
    [ Upstream commit 2a737d3b8c792400118d6cf94958f559de9c5e59 ]
    
    The tpg->np_login_sem is a semaphore that is used to serialize the login
    process when multiple login threads run concurrently against the same
    target portal group.
    
    The iscsi_target_locate_portal() function finds the tpg, calls
    iscsit_access_np() against the np_login_sem semaphore and saves the tpg
    pointer in conn->tpg;
    
    If iscsi_target_locate_portal() fails, the caller will check for the
    conn->tpg pointer and, if it's not NULL, then it will assume that
    iscsi_target_locate_portal() called iscsit_access_np() on the semaphore.
    
    Make sure that conn->tpg gets initialized only if iscsit_access_np() was
    successful, otherwise iscsit_deaccess_np() may end up being called against
    a semaphore we never took, allowing more than one thread to access the same
    tpg.

    gpio: Allow per-parent interrupt data
    
    [ Upstream commit cfe6807d82e97e81c3209dca9448f091e1448a57 ]
    
    The core gpiolib code is able to deal with multiple interrupt parents
    for a single gpio irqchip. It however only allows a single piece
    of data to be conveyed to all flow handlers (either the gpio_chip
    or some other, driver-specific data).
    
    This means that drivers have to go through some interesting dance
    to find the correct context, something that isn't great in interrupt
    context (see aebdc8abc9db86e2bd33070fc2f961012fff74b4 for a prime
    example).
    
    Instead, offer an optional way for a pinctrl/gpio driver to provide
    an array of pointers which gets used to provide the correct context
    to the flow handler.

    selftests: forwarding: Fix race condition in mirror installation
    
    [ Upstream commit c7c059fba6fb19c3bc924925c984772e733cb594 ]
    
    When mirroring to a gretap in hardware the device expects to be
    programmed with the egress port and all the encapsulating headers. This
    requires the driver to resolve the path the packet will take in the
    software data path and program the device accordingly.
    
    If the path cannot be resolved (in this case because of an unresolved
    neighbor), then mirror installation fails until the path is resolved.
    This results in a race that causes the test to sometimes fail.
    
    Fix this by setting the neighbor's state to permanent in a couple of
    tests, so that it is always valid.

    bpf/btf: Accept function names that contain dots
    
    [ Upstream commit 9724160b3942b0a967b91a59f81da5593f28b8ba ]
    
    When building a kernel with LLVM=1, LLVM_IAS=0 and CONFIG_KASAN=y, LLVM
    leaves DWARF tags for the "asan.module_ctor" & co symbols. In turn,
    pahole creates BTF_KIND_FUNC entries for these and this makes the BTF
    metadata validation fail because they contain a dot.
    
    In a dramatic turn of event, this BTF verification failure can cause
    the netfilter_bpf initialization to fail, causing netfilter_core to
    free the netfilter_helper hashmap and netfilter_ftp to trigger a
    use-after-free. The risk of u-a-f in netfilter will be addressed
    separately but the existence of "asan.module_ctor" debug info under some
    build conditions sounds like a good enough reason to accept functions
    that contain dots in BTF.
    
    Although using only LLVM=1 is the recommended way to compile clang-based
    kernels, users can certainly do LLVM=1, LLVM_IAS=0 as well and we still
    try to support that combination according to Nick. To clarify:
    
      - > v5.10 kernel, LLVM=1 (LLVM_IAS=0 is not the default) is recommended,
        but user can still have LLVM=1, LLVM_IAS=0 to trigger the issue
    
      - <= 5.10 kernel, LLVM=1 (LLVM_IAS=0 is the default) is recommended in
        which case GNU as will be used

    [ Upstream commit 2b84e215f87443c74ac0aa7f76bb172d43a87033 ]
    
    The .walk callback iterates over the current active set, but it might be
    useful to iterate over the next generation set. Use the generation mask
    to determine what set view (either current or next generation) is use
    for the walk iteration.

    netfilter: nf_tables: fix chain binding transaction logic
    
    [ Upstream commit 4bedf9eee016286c835e3d8fa981ddece5338795 ]
    
    Add bound flag to rule and chain transactions as in 6a0a8d10a366
    ("netfilter: nf_tables: use-after-free in failing rule with bound set")
    to skip them in case that the chain is already bound from the abort
    path.
    
    This patch fixes an imbalance in the chain use refcnt that triggers a
    WARN_ON on the table and chain destroy path.
    
    This patch also disallows nested chain bindings, which is not
    supported from userspace.
    
    The logic to deal with chain binding in nft_data_hold() and
    nft_data_release() is not correct. The NFT_TRANS_PREPARE state needs a
    special handling in case a chain is bound but next expressions in the
    same rule fail to initialize as described by 1240eb93f061 ("netfilter:
    nf_tables: incorrect error path handling with NFT_MSG_NEWRULE").
    
    The chain is left bound if rule construction fails, so the objects
    stored in this chain (and the chain itself) are released by the
    transaction records from the abort path, follow up patch ("netfilter:
    nf_tables: add NFT_TRANS_PREPARE_ERROR to deal with bound set/chain")
    completes this error handling.
    
    When deleting an existing rule, chain bound flag is set off so the
    rule expression .destroy path releases the objects.

    [ Upstream commit 7580e0a78eb29e7bb1a772eba4088250bbb70d41 ]
    
    We have seen a bug where the NIC incorrectly changes the length in the
    IP header of a padded packet to include the padding bytes. The driver
    already has a workaround for this so do the workaround for this NIC too.
    This resolves the issue.

    [ Upstream commit d7c66073559386b836bded7cdc8b66ee5c049129 ]
    
    BPDUs are link-local frames, therefore they must be trapped to the CPU
    port. Currently, the MT7530 switch treats BPDUs as regular multicast
    frames, therefore flooding them to user ports. To fix this, set BPDUs to be
    trapped to the CPU port. Group this on mt7530_setup() and
    mt7531_setup_common() into mt753x_trap_frames() and call that.

    ipvs: align inner_mac_header for encapsulation
    
    [ Upstream commit d7fce52fdf96663ddc2eb21afecff3775588612a ]
    
    When using encapsulation the original packet's headers are copied to the
    inner headers. This preserves the space for an inner mac header, which
    is not used by the inner payloads for the encapsulation types supported
    by IPVS. If a packet is using GUE or GRE encapsulation and needs to be
    segmented, flow can be passed to __skb_udp_tunnel_segment() which
    calculates a negative tunnel header length. A negative tunnel header
    length causes pskb_may_pull() to fail, dropping the packet.
    
    This can be observed by attaching probes to ip_vs_in_hook(),
    __dev_queue_xmit(), and __skb_udp_tunnel_segment():
    
        perf probe --add '__dev_queue_xmit skb->inner_mac_header \
        skb->inner_network_header skb->mac_header skb->network_header'
        perf probe --add '__skb_udp_tunnel_segment:7 tnl_hlen'
        perf probe -m ip_vs --add 'ip_vs_in_hook skb->inner_mac_header \
        skb->inner_network_header skb->mac_header skb->network_header'
    
    These probes the headers and tunnel header length for packets which
    traverse the IPVS encapsulation path. A TCP packet can be forced into
    the segmentation path by being smaller than a calculated clamped MSS,
    but larger than the advertised MSS.
    
        probe:ip_vs_in_hook: inner_mac_header=0x0 inner_network_header=0x0 mac_header=0x44 network_header=0x52
        probe:ip_vs_in_hook: inner_mac_header=0x44 inner_network_header=0x52 mac_header=0x44 network_header=0x32
        probe:dev_queue_xmit: inner_mac_header=0x44 inner_network_header=0x52 mac_header=0x44 network_header=0x32
        probe:__skb_udp_tunnel_segment_L7: tnl_hlen=-2
    
    When using veth-based encapsulation, the interfaces are set to be
    mac-less, which does not preserve space for an inner mac header. This
    prevents this issue from occurring.
    
    In our real-world testing of sending a 32KB file we observed operation
    time increasing from ~75ms for veth-based encapsulation to over 1.5s
    using IPVS encapsulation due to retries from dropped packets.
    
    This changeset modifies the packet on the encapsulation path in
    ip_vs_tunnel_xmit() and ip_vs_tunnel_xmit_v6() to remove the inner mac
    header offset. This fixes UDP segmentation for both encapsulation types,
    and corrects the inner headers for any IPIP flows that may use it.

    With offloading enabled, esp_xmit() gets invoked very late, from within
    validate_xmit_xfrm() which is after validate_xmit_skb() validates and
    linearizes the skb if the underlying device does not support fragments.
    
    esp_output_tail() may add a fragment to the skb while adding the auth
    tag/ IV. Devices without the proper support will then send skb->data
    points to with the correct length so the packet will have garbage at the
    end. A pcap sniffer will claim that the proper data has been sent since
    it parses the skb properly.
    
    It is not affected with INET_ESP_OFFLOAD disabled.
    
    Linearize the skb after offloading if the sending hardware requires it.
    It was tested on v4, v6 has been adopted.

    xfrm: fix inbound ipv4/udp/esp packets to UDPv6 dualstack sockets
    
    [ Upstream commit 1166a530a84758bb9e6b448fc8c195ed413f5ded ]
    
    Before Linux v5.8 an AF_INET6 SOCK_DGRAM (udp/udplite) socket
    with SOL_UDP, UDP_ENCAP, UDP_ENCAP_ESPINUDP{,_NON_IKE} enabled
    would just unconditionally use xfrm4_udp_encap_rcv(), afterwards
    such a socket would use the newly added xfrm6_udp_encap_rcv()
    which only handles IPv6 packets.

    bpf: Fix verifier id tracking of scalars on spill
    
    [ Upstream commit 713274f1f2c896d37017efee333fd44149710119 ]
    
    The following scenario describes a bug in the verifier where it
    incorrectly concludes about equivalent scalar IDs which could lead to
    verifier bypass in privileged mode:
    
    1. Prepare a 32-bit rogue number.
    2. Put the rogue number into the upper half of a 64-bit register, and
       roll a random (unknown to the verifier) bit in the lower half. The
       rest of the bits should be zero (although variations are possible).
    3. Assign an ID to the register by MOVing it to another arbitrary
       register.
    4. Perform a 32-bit spill of the register, then perform a 32-bit fill to
       another register. Due to a bug in the verifier, the ID will be
       preserved, although the new register will contain only the lower 32
       bits, i.e. all zeros except one random bit.
    
    At this point there are two registers with different values but the same
    ID, which means the integrity of the verifier state has been corrupted.
    
    5. Compare the new 32-bit register with 0. In the branch where it's
       equal to 0, the verifier will believe that the original 64-bit
       register is also 0, because it has the same ID, but its actual value
       still contains the rogue number in the upper half.
       Some optimizations of the verifier prevent the actual bypass, so
       extra care is needed: the comparison must be between two registers,
       and both branches must be reachable (this is why one random bit is
       needed). Both branches are still suitable for the bypass.
    6. Right shift the original register by 32 bits to pop the rogue number.
    7. Use the rogue number as an offset with any pointer. The verifier will
       believe that the offset is 0, while in reality it's the given number.
    
    The fix is similar to the 32-bit BPF_MOV handling in check_alu_op for
    SCALAR_VALUE. If the spill is narrowing the actual register value, don't
    keep the ID, make sure it's reset to 0.

    bpf: track immediate values written to stack by BPF_ST instruction
    
    [ Upstream commit ecdf985d7615356b78241fdb159c091830ed0380 ]
    
    For aligned stack writes using BPF_ST instruction track stored values
    in a same way BPF_STX is handled, e.g. make sure that the following
    commands produce similar verifier knowledge:
    
      fp[-8] = 42;             r1 = 42;
                           fp[-8] = r1;
    
    This covers two cases:
     - non-null values written to stack are stored as spill of fake
       registers;
     - null values written to stack are stored as STACK_ZERO marks.
    
    Previously both cases above used STACK_MISC marks instead.
    
    Some verifier test cases relied on the old logic to obtain STACK_MISC
    marks for some stack values. These test cases are updated in the same
    commit to avoid failures during bisect.

    xfrm: Ensure policies always checked on XFRM-I input path
    
    [ Upstream commit a287f5b0cfc6804c5b12a4be13c7c9fe27869e90 ]
    
    This change adds methods in the XFRM-I input path that ensures that
    policies are checked prior to processing of the subsequent decapsulated
    packet, after which the relevant policies may no longer be resolvable
    (due to changing src/dst/proto/etc).
    
    Notably, raw ESP/AH packets did not perform policy checks inherently,
    whereas all other encapsulated packets (UDP, TCP encapsulated) do policy
    checks after calling xfrm_input handling in the respective encapsulation
    layer.

    xfrm: Treat already-verified secpath entries as optional
    
    [ Upstream commit 1f8b6df6a997a430b0c48b504638154b520781ad ]
    
    This change allows inbound traffic through nested IPsec tunnels to
    successfully match policies and templates, while retaining the secpath
    stack trace as necessary for netfilter policies.
    
    Specifically, this patch marks secpath entries that have already matched
    against a relevant policy as having been verified, allowing it to be
    treated as optional and skipped after a tunnel decapsulation (during
    which the src/dst/proto/etc may have changed, and the correct policy
    chain no long be resolvable).
    
    This approach is taken as opposed to the iteration in b0355dbbf13c,
    where the secpath was cleared, since that breaks subsequent validations
    that rely on the existence of the secpath entries (netfilter policies, or
    transport-in-tunnel mode, where policies remain resolvable).

    x86/mm: Avoid using set_pgd() outside of real PGD pages
    
    commit d082d48737c75d2b3cc1f972b8c8674c25131534 upstream.
    
    KPTI keeps around two PGDs: one for userspace and another for the
    kernel. Among other things, set_pgd() contains infrastructure to
    ensure that updates to the kernel PGD are reflected in the user PGD
    as well.
    
    One side-effect of this is that set_pgd() expects to be passed whole
    pages.  Unfortunately, init_trampoline_kaslr() passes in a single entry:
    'trampoline_pgd_entry'.
    
    When KPTI is on, set_pgd() will update 'trampoline_pgd_entry' (an
    8-Byte globally stored [.bss] variable) and will then proceed to
    replicate that value into the non-existent neighboring user page
    (located +4k away), leading to the corruption of other global [.bss]
    stored variables.
    
    Fix it by directly assigning 'trampoline_pgd_entry' and avoiding
    set_pgd().

    nilfs2: prevent general protection fault in nilfs_clear_dirty_page()
    
    commit 782e53d0c14420858dbf0f8f797973c150d3b6d7 upstream.
    
    In a syzbot stress test that deliberately causes file system errors on
    nilfs2 with a corrupted disk image, it has been reported that
    nilfs_clear_dirty_page() called from nilfs_clear_dirty_pages() can cause a
    general protection fault.
    
    In nilfs_clear_dirty_pages(), when looking up dirty pages from the page
    cache and calling nilfs_clear_dirty_page() for each dirty page/folio
    retrieved, the back reference from the argument page to "mapping" may have
    been changed to NULL (and possibly others).  It is necessary to check this
    after locking the page/folio.
    
    So, fix this issue by not calling nilfs_clear_dirty_page() on a page/folio
    after locking it in nilfs_clear_dirty_pages() if the back reference
    "mapping" from the page/folio is different from the "mapping" that held
    the page/folio just before.

    io_uring/net: disable partial retries for recvmsg with cmsg
    
    Commit 78d0d2063bab954d19a1696feae4c7706a626d48 upstream.
    
    We cannot sanely handle partial retries for recvmsg if we have cmsg
    attached. If we don't, then we'd just be overwriting the initial cmsg
    header on retries. Alternatively we could increment and handle this
    appropriately, but it doesn't seem worth the complication.
    
    Move the MSG_WAITALL check into the non-multishot case while at it,
    since MSG_WAITALL is explicitly disabled for multishot anyway.

    If the application sets ->msg_control and we have to later retry this

    need to retain the original msg_control value. This is due to the net
    stack overwriting this field with an in-kernel pointer, to copy it
    in. Hitting that path for the second time will now fail the copy from
    user, as it's attempting to copy from a non-user address.

    This problem arises from the fact that the repurposed writeback_dirty_page
    trace event code was written assuming that every pointer to mapping
    (struct address_space) would come from a file-mapped page-cache object,
    thus mapping->host would always be populated, and that was a valid case
    before commit 19343b5bdd16.  The swap-cache address space
    (swapper_spaces), however, doesn't populate its ->host (struct inode)
    pointer, thus leading to the crashes in the corner-case aforementioned.
    
    commit 19343b5bdd16 ended up breaking the assignment of __entry->name and
    __entry->ino for the wait_on_page_writeback tracepoint -- both dependent
    on mapping->host carrying a pointer to a valid inode.  The assignment of
    __entry->name was fixed by commit 68f23b89067f ("memcg: fix a crash in
    wb_workfn when a device disappears"), and this commit fixes the remaining
    case, for __entry->ino.

    regmap: spi-avmm: Fix regmap_bus max_raw_write
    
    [ Upstream commit c8e796895e2310b6130e7577248da1d771431a77 ]
    
    The max_raw_write member of the regmap_spi_avmm_bus structure is defined
    as:
            .max_raw_write = SPI_AVMM_VAL_SIZE * MAX_WRITE_CNT
    
    SPI_AVMM_VAL_SIZE == 4 and MAX_WRITE_CNT == 1 so this results in a
    maximum write transfer size of 4 bytes which provides only enough space to
    transfer the address of the target register. It provides no space for the
    value to be transferred. This bug became an issue (divide-by-zero in
    _regmap_raw_write()) after the following was accepted into mainline:
    
    commit 3981514180c9 ("regmap: Account for register length when chunking")
    
    Change max_raw_write to include space (4 additional bytes) for both the
    register address and value:
    
            .max_raw_write = SPI_AVMM_REG_SIZE + SPI_AVMM_VAL_SIZE * MAX_WRITE_CNT

    ip_tunnels: allow VXLAN/GENEVE to inherit TOS/TTL from VLAN
    
    commit 7074732c8faee201a245a6f983008a5789c0be33 upstream.
    
    The current code allows for VXLAN and GENEVE to inherit the TOS
    respective the TTL when skb-protocol is ETH_P_IP or ETH_P_IPV6.
    However when the payload is VLAN encapsulated, then this inheriting
    does not work, because the visible skb-protocol is of type
    ETH_P_8021Q or ETH_P_8021AD.
    
    Instead of skb->protocol use skb_protocol().

    its existing logic do its work.

    mmc: sdhci-msm: Disable broken 64-bit DMA on MSM8916
    
    commit e6f9e590b72e12bbb86b1b8be7e1981f357392ad upstream.
    
    While SDHCI claims to support 64-bit DMA on MSM8916 it does not seem to
    be properly functional. It is not immediately obvious because SDHCI is
    usually used with IOMMU bypassed on this SoC, and all physical memory
    has 32-bit addresses. But when trying to enable the IOMMU it quickly
    fails with an error such as the following:
    
      arm-smmu 1e00000.iommu: Unhandled context fault:

    Looking closely it's obvious that only the 32-bit part of the address
    (0xfffff200) arrives at the SMMU, the higher 16-bit (0xffff...) get
    lost somewhere. This might not be a limitation of the SDHCI itself but
    perhaps the bus/interconnect it is connected to, or even the connection
    to the SMMU.
    
    Work around this by setting SDHCI_QUIRK2_BROKEN_64_BIT_DMA to avoid
    using 64-bit addresses.

    mutex_unlock(&cpuset_mutex)  | mutex_unlock(&cgroup_mutex)
    
    Inside css_task_iter_start/next/end, css_set_lock is hold and then
    released, so when iterating task(left side), the css_set may be moved to
    another list(right side), then it->cset_head points to the old list head
    and it->cset_pos->next points to the head node of new list, which can't
    be used as struct css_set.
    
    To fix this issue, switch from all css_sets to only scgrp's css_sets to
    patch in-flight iterators to preserve correct iteration, and then
    update it->cset_head as well.

    PCI: hv: Add a per-bus mutex state_lock
    
    commit 067d6ec7ed5b49380688e06c1e5f883a71bef4fe upstream.
    
    In the case of fast device addition/removal, it's possible that
    hv_eject_device_work() can start to run before create_root_hv_pci_bus()
    starts to run; as a result, the pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot() in
    hv_eject_device_work() can return a 'pdev' of NULL, and
    hv_eject_device_work() can remove the 'hpdev', and immediately send a
    message PCI_EJECTION_COMPLETE to the host, and the host immediately
    unassigns the PCI device from the guest; meanwhile,
    create_root_hv_pci_bus() and the PCI device driver can be probing the
    dead PCI device and reporting timeout errors.
    
    Fix the issue by adding a per-bus mutex 'state_lock' and grabbing the
    mutex before powering on the PCI bus in hv_pci_enter_d0(): when
    hv_eject_device_work() starts to run, it's able to find the 'pdev' and call
    pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device(pdev): if the PCI device driver has
    loaded, the PCI device driver's probe() function is already called in
    create_root_hv_pci_bus() -> pci_bus_add_devices(), and now
    hv_eject_device_work() -> pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device() is able
    to call the PCI device driver's remove() function and remove the device
    reliably; if the PCI device driver hasn't loaded yet, the function call
    hv_eject_device_work() -> pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device() is able to
    remove the PCI device reliably and the PCI device driver's probe()
    function won't be called; if the PCI device driver's probe() is already
    running (e.g., systemd-udev is loading the PCI device driver), it must
    be holding the per-device lock, and after the probe() finishes and releases
    the lock, hv_eject_device_work() -> pci_stop_and_remove_bus_device() is
    able to proceed to remove the device reliably.

    PCI: hv: Fix a race condition in hv_irq_unmask() that can cause panic
    
    commit 2738d5ab7929a845b654cd171a1e275c37eb428e upstream.
    
    When the host tries to remove a PCI device, the host first sends a
    PCI_EJECT message to the guest, and the guest is supposed to gracefully
    remove the PCI device and send a PCI_EJECTION_COMPLETE message to the host;
    the host then sends a VMBus message CHANNELMSG_RESCIND_CHANNELOFFER to
    the guest (when the guest receives this message, the device is already
    unassigned from the guest) and the guest can do some final cleanup work;
    if the guest fails to respond to the PCI_EJECT message within one minute,
    the host sends the VMBus message CHANNELMSG_RESCIND_CHANNELOFFER and
    removes the PCI device forcibly.
    
    In the case of fast device addition/removal, it's possible that the PCI
    device driver is still configuring MSI-X interrupts when the guest receives
    the PCI_EJECT message; the channel callback calls hv_pci_eject_device(),
    which sets hpdev->state to hv_pcichild_ejecting, and schedules a work
    hv_eject_device_work(); if the PCI device driver is calling
    pci_alloc_irq_vectors() -> ... -> hv_compose_msi_msg(), we can break the
    while loop in hv_compose_msi_msg() due to the updated hpdev->state, and
    leave data->chip_data with its default value of NULL; later, when the PCI
    device driver calls request_irq() -> ... -> hv_irq_unmask(), the guest
    crashes in hv_arch_irq_unmask() due to data->chip_data being NULL.
    
    Fix the issue by not testing hpdev->state in the while loop: when the
    guest receives PCI_EJECT, the device is still assigned to the guest, and
    the guest has one minute to finish the device removal gracefully. We don't
    really need to (and we should not) test hpdev->state in the loop.

    commit a847234e24d03d01a9566d1d9dcce018cc018d67 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit d6af2ed29c7c1c311b96dac989dcb991e90ee195.
    
    The statement "the hv_pci_bus_exit() call releases structures of all its
    child devices" in commit d6af2ed29c7c is not true: in the path
    hv_pci_probe() -> hv_pci_enter_d0() -> hv_pci_bus_exit(hdev, true): the
    parameter "keep_devs" is true, so hv_pci_bus_exit() does *not* release the
    child "struct hv_pci_dev *hpdev" that is created earlier in
    pci_devices_present_work() -> new_pcichild_device().
    
    The commit d6af2ed29c7c was originally made in July 2020 for RHEL 7.7,
    where the old version of hv_pci_bus_exit() was used; when the commit was
    rebased and merged into the upstream, people didn't notice that it's
    not really necessary. The commit itself doesn't cause any issue, but it
    makes hv_pci_probe() more complicated. Revert it to facilitate some
    upcoming changes to hv_pci_probe().

    Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix vmbus_wait_for_unload() to scan present CPUs
    
    commit 320805ab61e5f1e2a5729ae266e16bec2904050c upstream.
    
    vmbus_wait_for_unload() may be called in the panic path after other
    CPUs are stopped. vmbus_wait_for_unload() currently loops through
    online CPUs looking for the UNLOAD response message. But the values of
    CONFIG_KEXEC_CORE and crash_kexec_post_notifiers affect the path used
    to stop the other CPUs, and in one of the paths the stopped CPUs
    are removed from cpu_online_mask. This removal happens in both
    x86/x64 and arm64 architectures. In such a case, vmbus_wait_for_unload()
    only checks the panic'ing CPU, and misses the UNLOAD response message
    except when the panic'ing CPU is CPU 0. vmbus_wait_for_unload()
    eventually times out, but only after waiting 100 seconds.
    
    Fix this by looping through *present* CPUs in vmbus_wait_for_unload().
    The cpu_present_mask is not modified by stopping the other CPUs in the
    panic path, nor should it be.
    
    Also, in a CoCo VM the synic_message_page is not allocated in
    hv_synic_alloc(), but is set and cleared in hv_synic_enable_regs()
    and hv_synic_disable_regs() such that it is set only when the CPU is
    online.  If not all present CPUs are online when vmbus_wait_for_unload()
    is called, the synic_message_page might be NULL. Add a check for this.

    KVM: Avoid illegal stage2 mapping on invalid memory slot
    
    commit 2230f9e1171a2e9731422a14d1bbc313c0b719d1 upstream.
    
    We run into guest hang in edk2 firmware when KSM is kept as running on
    the host. The edk2 firmware is waiting for status 0x80 from QEMU's pflash
    device (TYPE_PFLASH_CFI01) during the operation of sector erasing or
    buffered write. The status is returned by reading the memory region of
    the pflash device and the read request should have been forwarded to QEMU
    and emulated by it. Unfortunately, the read request is covered by an
    illegal stage2 mapping when the guest hang issue occurs. The read request
    is completed with QEMU bypassed and wrong status is fetched. The edk2
    firmware runs into an infinite loop with the wrong status.
    
    The illegal stage2 mapping is populated due to same page sharing by KSM
    at (C) even the associated memory slot has been marked as invalid at (B)
    when the memory slot is requested to be deleted. It's notable that the
    active and inactive memory slots can't be swapped when we're in the middle
    of kvm_mmu_notifier_change_pte() because kvm->mn_active_invalidate_count
    is elevated, and kvm_swap_active_memslots() will busy loop until it reaches
    to zero again. Besides, the swapping from the active to the inactive memory
    slots is also avoided by holding &kvm->srcu in __kvm_handle_hva_range(),
    corresponding to synchronize_srcu_expedited() in kvm_swap_active_memslots().

      kvm_mmu_notifier_invalidate_range_end
    
    Fix the issue by skipping the invalid memory slot at (C) to avoid the
    illegal stage2 mapping so that the read request for the pflash's status
    is forwarded to QEMU and emulated by it. In this way, the correct pflash's
    status can be returned from QEMU to break the infinite loop in the edk2
    firmware.
    
    We tried a git-bisect and the first problematic commit is cd4c71835228 ("
    KVM: arm64: Convert to the gfn-based MMU notifier callbacks"). With this,
    clean_dcache_guest_page() is called after the memory slots are iterated
    in kvm_mmu_notifier_change_pte(). clean_dcache_guest_page() is called
    before the iteration on the memory slots before this commit. This change
    literally enlarges the racy window between kvm_mmu_notifier_change_pte()
    and memory slot removal so that we're able to reproduce the issue in a
    practical test case. However, the issue exists since commit d5d8184d35c9
    ("KVM: ARM: Memory virtualization setup").

    ACPI: sleep: Avoid breaking S3 wakeup due to might_sleep()
    
    commit 22db06337f590d01d79f60f181d8dfe5a9ef9085 upstream.
    
    The addition of might_sleep() to down_timeout() caused the latter to
    enable interrupts unconditionally in some cases, which in turn broke
    the ACPI S3 wakeup path in acpi_suspend_enter(), where down_timeout()
    is called by acpi_disable_all_gpes() via acpi_ut_acquire_mutex().
    
    Namely, if CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP is set, might_sleep() causes
    might_resched() to be used and if CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY is set,
    this triggers __cond_resched() which may call preempt_schedule_common(),
    so __schedule() gets invoked and it ends up with enabled interrupts (in
    the prev == next case).
    
    Now, enabling interrupts early in the S3 wakeup path causes the kernel
    to crash.
    
    Address this by modifying acpi_suspend_enter() to disable GPEs without
    attempting to acquire the sleeping lock which is not needed in that code
    path anyway.

    nilfs2: fix buffer corruption due to concurrent device reads
    
    commit 679bd7ebdd315bf457a4740b306ae99f1d0a403d upstream.
    
    As a result of analysis of a syzbot report, it turned out that in three
    cases where nilfs2 allocates block device buffers directly via sb_getblk,
    concurrent reads to the device can corrupt the allocated buffers.
    
    Nilfs2 uses sb_getblk for segment summary blocks, that make up a log
    header, and the super root block, that is the trailer, and when moving and
    writing the second super block after fs resize.
    
    In any of these, since the uptodate flag is not set when storing metadata
    to be written in the allocated buffers, the stored metadata will be
    overwritten if a device read of the same block occurs concurrently before
    the write.  This causes metadata corruption and misbehavior in the log
    write itself, causing warnings in nilfs_btree_assign() as reported.
    
    Fix these issues by setting an uptodate flag on the buffer head on the
    first or before modifying each buffer obtained with sb_getblk, and
    clearing the flag on failure.
    
    When setting the uptodate flag, the lock_buffer/unlock_buffer pair is used
    to perform necessary exclusive control, and the buffer is filled to ensure
    that uninitialized bytes are not mixed into the data read from others.  As
    for buffers for segment summary blocks, they are filled incrementally, so
    if the uptodate flag was unset on their allocation, set the flag and zero
    fill the buffer once at that point.
    
    Also, regarding the superblock move routine, the starting point of the
    memset call to zerofill the block is incorrectly specified, which can
    cause a buffer overflow on file systems with block sizes greater than
    4KiB.  In addition, if the superblock is moved within a large block, it is
    necessary to assume the possibility that the data in the superblock will
    be destroyed by zero-filling before copying.  So fix these potential
    issues as well.

    selftests: mptcp: join: skip check if MIB counter not supported
    
    commit 47867f0a7e831e24e5eab3330667ce9682d50fb1 upstream.
    
    Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
    supporting all MPTCP features.
    
    One of them is the MPTCP MIB counters introduced in commit fc518953bc9c
    ("mptcp: add and use MIB counter infrastructure") and more later. The
    MPTCP Join selftest heavily relies on these counters.
    
    If a counter is not supported by the kernel, it is not displayed when
    using 'nstat -z'. We can then detect that and skip the verification. A
    new helper (get_counter()) has been added to do the required checks and
    return an error if the counter is not available.
    
    Note that if we expect to have these features available and if
    SELFTESTS_MPTCP_LIB_EXPECT_ALL_FEATURES env var is set to 1, the tests
    will be marked as failed instead of skipped.
    
    This new helper also makes sure we get the exact counter we want to
    avoid issues we had in the past, e.g. with MPTcpExtRmAddr and
    MPTcpExtRmAddrDrop sharing the same prefix. While at it, we uniform the
    way we fetch a MIB counter.
    
    Note for the backports: we rarely change these modified blocks so if
    there is are conflicts, it is very likely because a counter is not used
    in the older kernels and we don't need that chunk.

    commit 2177d0b08e421971e035672b70f3228d9485c650 upstream.
    
    Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
    supporting all MPTCP features.
    
    One of them is the checks of the default limits returned by the MPTCP
    in-kernel path-manager. The default values have been modified by commit
    72bcbc46a5c3 ("mptcp: increase default max additional subflows to 2").
    Instead of comparing with hardcoded values, we can get the default one
    and compare with them.
    
    Note that if we expect to have the latest version, we continue to check
    the hardcoded values to avoid unexpected behaviour changes.

    selftests: mptcp: lib: skip if not below kernel version
    
    commit b1a6a38ab8a633546cefae890da842f19e006c74 upstream.
    
    Selftests are supposed to run on any kernels, including the old ones not
    supporting all MPTCP features.
    
    A new function is now available to easily detect if a feature is
    missing by looking at the kernel version. That's clearly not ideal and
    this kind of check should be avoided as soon as possible. But sometimes,
    there are no external sign that a "feature" is available or not:
    internal behaviours can change without modifying the uAPI and these
    selftests are verifying the internal behaviours. Sometimes, the only
    (easy) way to verify if the feature is present is to run the test but
    then the validation cannot determine if there is a failure with the
    feature or if the feature is missing. Then it looks better to check the
    kernel version instead of having tests that can never fail. In any case,
    we need a solution not to have a whole selftest being marked as failed
    just because one sub-test has failed.
    
    Note that this env var car be set to 1 not to do such check and run the
    linked sub-test: SELFTESTS_MPTCP_LIB_NO_KVERSION_CHECK.
    
    This new helper is going to be used in the following commits. In order
    to ease the backport of such future patches, it would be good if this
    patch is backported up to the introduction of MPTCP selftests, hence the
    Fixes tag below: this type of check was supposed to be done from the
    beginning.

    tick/common: Align tick period during sched_timer setup
    
    commit 13bb06f8dd42071cb9a49f6e21099eea05d4b856 upstream.
    
    The tick period is aligned very early while the first clock_event_device is
    registered. At that point the system runs in periodic mode and switches
    later to one-shot mode if possible.
    
    The next wake-up event is programmed based on the aligned value
    (tick_next_period) but the delta value, that is used to program the
    clock_event_device, is computed based on ktime_get().
    
    With the subtracted offset, the device fires earlier than the exact time
    frame. With a large enough offset the system programs the timer for the
    next wake-up and the remaining time left is too small to make any boot
    progress. The system hangs.
    
    Move the alignment later to the setup of tick_sched timer. At this point
    the system switches to oneshot mode and a high resolution clocksource is
    available. At this point it is safe to align tick_next_period because
    ktime_get() will now return accurate (not jiffies based) time.

    sequence used in the DC with a new one. As a result of this transition,
    we moved some specific parts from the commit sequence and brought them
    to amdgpu_dm. This commit adds a wrapper inside DM that enable our
    drivers to do any necessary preparation or change before we offload the
    plane/stream update to DC.

    drm/amd/display: Use dc_update_planes_and_stream
    
    commit f7511289821ffccc07579406d6ab520aa11049f5 upstream.
    
    [Why & How]
    The old dc_commit_updates_for_stream lacks manipulation for many corner
    cases where the DC feature requires special attention; as a result, it
    starts to show its limitation (e.g., the SubVP feature is not supported
    by it, among other cases). To modernize and unify our internal API, this
    commit replaces the old dc_commit_updates_for_stream with
    dc_update_planes_and_stream, which has more features.

    drm/amd/display: Add minimal pipe split transition state
    
    commit 97ca308925a50aa80711ccfaf814fa3898374862 upstream.
    
    [WHY?]
    When adding/removing a plane to some configurations, unsupported pipe
    programming can occur when moving to a new plane.  Such cases include pipe
    split on multi-display, with MPO, and/or ODM.
    
    [HOW?]
    Add a safe transistion state that minimizes pipe usage before programming
    new configuration. When adding a plane, the current state has the least
    pipes required so it is applied without splitting.  This must be applied
    prior to updating the plane_state for seamless transition.  When removing a
    plane, the new state has the least pieps required so it is applied without
    splitting.

    tracing: Add tracing_reset_all_online_cpus_unlocked() function
    
    commit e18eb8783ec4949adebc7d7b0fdb65f65bfeefd9 upstream.
    
    Currently the tracing_reset_all_online_cpus() requires the
    trace_types_lock held. But only one caller of this function actually has
    that lock held before calling it, and the other just takes the lock so
    that it can call it. More users of this function is needed where the lock
    is not held.
    
    Add a tracing_reset_all_online_cpus_unlocked() function for the one use
    case that calls it without being held, and also add a lockdep_assert to
    make sure it is held when called.
    
    Then have tracing_reset_all_online_cpus() take the lock internally, such
    that callers do not need to worry about taking it.

    [ Upstream commit ea2062dd1f0384ae1b136d333ee4ced15bedae38 ]
    
    [Why]
    When the PSR enabled. If you try to adjust the timing parameters,
    it may cause system hang. Because the timing mismatch with the
    DMCUB settings.
    
    [How]
    Disable the PSR before adjusting timing parameters.
