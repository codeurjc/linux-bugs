    Revert "staging: rtl8192e: Replace macro RTL_PCI_DEVICE with PCI_DEVICE"
    
    This reverts commit 8809b5e3bca90170deb466d7f4447dc91c8569da which is
    commit fda2093860df4812d69052a8cf4997e53853a340 upstream.
    
    Ben reports that this should not have been backported to the older
    kernels as the rest of the macro is not empty.  It was a clean-up patch
    in 6.4-rc1 only, it did not add new device ids.

    btrfs: unset reloc control if transaction commit fails in prepare_to_relocate()
    
    commit 85f02d6c856b9f3a0acf5219de6e32f58b9778eb upstream.
    
    In btrfs_relocate_block_group(), the rc is allocated.  Then
    btrfs_relocate_block_group() calls
    
    relocate_block_group()
      prepare_to_relocate()
        set_reloc_control()
    
    that assigns rc to the variable fs_info->reloc_ctl. When
    prepare_to_relocate() returns, it calls
    
    btrfs_commit_transaction()
      btrfs_start_dirty_block_groups()
        btrfs_alloc_path()
          kmem_cache_zalloc()
    
    which may fail for example (or other errors could happen). When the
    failure occurs, btrfs_relocate_block_group() detects the error and frees
    rc and doesn't set fs_info->reloc_ctl to NULL. After that, in
    btrfs_init_reloc_root(), rc is retrieved from fs_info->reloc_ctl and
    then used, which may cause a use-after-free bug.
    
    This possible bug can be triggered by calling btrfs_ioctl_balance()
    before calling btrfs_ioctl_defrag().
    
    To fix this possible bug, in prepare_to_relocate(), check if
    btrfs_commit_transaction() fails. If the failure occurs,
    unset_reloc_control() is called to set fs_info->reloc_ctl to NULL.
    
    The error log in our fault-injection testing is shown as follows:

    commit fb686c6824dd6294ca772b92424b8fba666e7d00 upstream.
    
    There are a few places where we don't check the return value of
    btrfs_commit_transaction in relocation.c.  Thankfully all these places
    have straightforward error handling, so simply change all of the sites
    at once.

    ext4: only check dquot_initialize_needed() when debugging
    
    commit dea9d8f7643fab07bf89a1155f1f94f37d096a5e upstream.
    
    ext4_xattr_block_set() relies on its caller to call dquot_initialize()
    on the inode.  To assure that this has happened there are WARN_ON
    checks.  Unfortunately, this is subject to false positives if there is
    an antagonist thread which is flipping the file system at high rates
    between r/o and rw.  So only do the check if EXT4_XATTR_DEBUG is
    enabled.

    If pm runtime resume fails the .remove callback used to exit early. This
    resulted in an error message by the driver core but the device gets
    removed anyhow. This lets the registered i2c adapter stay around with an
    unbound parent device.
    
    So only skip clk disabling if resume failed, but do delete the adapter.

    ceph: fix use-after-free bug for inodes when flushing capsnaps
    
    commit 409e873ea3c1fd3079909718bbeb06ac1ec7f38b upstream.
    
    There is a race between capsnaps flush and removing the inode from
    'mdsc->snap_flush_list' list:
    
       == Thread A ==                     == Thread B ==
    ceph_queue_cap_snap()
     -> allocate 'capsnapA'
     ->ihold('&ci->vfs_inode')
     ->add 'capsnapA' to 'ci->i_cap_snaps'
     ->add 'ci' to 'mdsc->snap_flush_list'
        ...
       == Thread C ==
    ceph_flush_snaps()
     ->__ceph_flush_snaps()
      ->__send_flush_snap()
                                    handle_cap_flushsnap_ack()
                                     ->iput('&ci->vfs_inode')
                                       this also will release 'ci'
                                        ...
                                          == Thread D ==
                                    ceph_handle_snap()
                                     ->flush_snaps()
                                      ->iterate 'mdsc->snap_flush_list'
                                       ->get the stale 'ci'
     ->remove 'ci' from                ->ihold(&ci->vfs_inode) this
       'mdsc->snap_flush_list'           will WARNING
    
    To fix this we will increase the inode's i_count ref when adding 'ci'
    to the 'mdsc->snap_flush_list' list.

    Input: xpad - delete a Razer DeathAdder mouse VID/PID entry
    
    commit feee70f4568650cf44c573488798ffc0a2faeea3 upstream.
    
    While doing my research to improve the xpad device names I noticed
    that the 1532:0037 VID/PID seems to be used by the DeathAdder 2013,
    so that Razer Sabertooth instance looked wrong and very suspect to
    me. I didn't see any mention in the official drivers, either.
    
    After doing more research, it turns out that the xpad list
    is used by many other projects (like Steam) as-is [1], this
    issue was reported [2] and Valve/Sam Lantinga fixed it [3]:
    
    [1]: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/dcc5eef0e2395854b254ea2873a4899edab347c6/src/joystick/controller_type.h#L251
    [2]: https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/0/1743392486228754770/
    [3]: https://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/rev/29809f6f0271
    
    (With multiple Internet users reporting similar issues, not linked here)
    
    After not being able to find the correct VID/PID combination anywhere
    on the Internet and not receiving any reply from Razer support I did
    some additional detective work, it seems like it presents itself as
    "Razer Sabertooth Gaming Controller (XBOX360)", code 1689:FE00.
    
    Leaving us with this:
     * Razer Sabertooth (1689:fe00)
     * Razer Sabertooth Elite (24c6:5d04)
     * Razer DeathAdder 2013 (1532:0037) [note: not a gamepad]
    
    So, to sum things up; remove this conflicting/duplicate entry:
    
    { 0x1532, 0x0037, "Razer Sabertooth", 0, XTYPE_XBOX360 },
    
    As the real/correct one is already present there, even if
    the Internet as a whole insists on presenting it as the
    Razer Sabertooth Elite, which (by all accounts) is not:
    
    { 0x1689, 0xfe00, "Razer Sabertooth", 0, XTYPE_XBOX360 },

    batman-adv: Broken sync while rescheduling delayed work
    
    commit abac3ac97fe8734b620e7322a116450d7f90aa43 upstream.
    
    Syzkaller got a lot of crashes like:
    KASAN: use-after-free Write in *_timers*
    
    All of these crashes point to the same memory area:
    
    The buggy address belongs to the object at ffff88801f870000
     which belongs to the cache kmalloc-8k of size 8192
    The buggy address is located 5320 bytes inside of
     8192-byte region [ffff88801f870000, ffff88801f872000)
    
    This area belongs to :
            batadv_priv->batadv_priv_dat->delayed_work->timer_list
    
    The reason for these issues is the lack of synchronization. Delayed
    work (batadv_dat_purge) schedules new timer/work while the device
    is being deleted. As the result new timer/delayed work is set after
    cancel_delayed_work_sync() was called. So after the device is freed
    the timer list contains pointer to already freed memory.

    bnxt_en: Query default VLAN before VNIC setup on a VF
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a9e4f501bc6ff1b6ecb60df54fbf2b54db43bfe ]
    
    We need to call bnxt_hwrm_func_qcfg() on a VF to query the default
    VLAN that may be setup by the PF.  If a default VLAN is enabled,
    the VF cannot support VLAN acceleration on the receive side and
    the VNIC must be setup to strip out the default VLAN tag.  If a
    default VLAN is not enabled, the VF can support VLAN acceleration
    on the receive side.  The VNIC should be set up to strip or not
    strip the VLAN based on the RX VLAN acceleration setting.
    
    Without this call to determine the default VLAN before calling
    bnxt_setup_vnic(), the VNIC may not be set up correctly.  For
    example, bnxt_setup_vnic() may set up to strip the VLAN tag based
    on stale default VLAN information.  If RX VLAN acceleration is
    not enabled, the VLAN tag will be incorrectly stripped and the
    RX data path will not work correctly.

    lib: cpu_rmap: Fix potential use-after-free in irq_cpu_rmap_release()
    
    [ Upstream commit 7c5d4801ecf0564c860033d89726b99723c55146 ]
    
    irq_cpu_rmap_release() calls cpu_rmap_put(), which may free the rmap.
    So we need to clear the pointer to our glue structure in rmap before
    doing that, not after.

    [ Upstream commit 886bc7d6ed3357975c5f1d3c784da96000d4bbb4 ]
    
    rtm_tca_policy is used from net/sched/sch_api.c and net/sched/cls_api.c,
    thus should be declared in an include file.
    
    This fixes the following sparse warning:

    Bluetooth: Fix l2cap_disconnect_req deadlock
    
    [ Upstream commit 02c5ea5246a44d6ffde0fddebfc1d56188052976 ]
    
    L2CAP assumes that the locks conn->chan_lock and chan->lock are
    acquired in the order conn->chan_lock, chan->lock to avoid
    potential deadlock.
    For example, l2sock_shutdown acquires these locks in the order:
      mutex_lock(&conn->chan_lock)
      l2cap_chan_lock(chan)
    
    However, l2cap_disconnect_req acquires chan->lock in
    l2cap_get_chan_by_scid first and then acquires conn->chan_lock
    before calling l2cap_chan_del. This means that these locks are
    acquired in unexpected order, which leads to potential deadlock:
      l2cap_chan_lock(c)
      mutex_lock(&conn->chan_lock)
    
    This patch releases chan->lock before acquiring the conn_chan_lock
    to avoid the potential deadlock.

    spi: qup: Request DMA before enabling clocks
    
    [ Upstream commit 0c331fd1dccfba657129380ee084b95c1cedfbef ]
    
    It is usually better to request all necessary resources (clocks,
    regulators, ...) before starting to make use of them. That way they do
    not change state in case one of the resources is not available yet and
    probe deferral (-EPROBE_DEFER) is necessary. This is particularly
    important for DMA channels and IOMMUs which are not enforced by
    fw_devlink yet (unless you use fw_devlink.strict=1).
    
    spi-qup does this in the wrong order, the clocks are enabled and
    disabled again when the DMA channels are not available yet.
    
    This causes issues in some cases: On most SoCs one of the SPI QUP
    clocks is shared with the UART controller. When using earlycon UART is
    actively used during boot but might not have probed yet, usually for
    the same reason (waiting for the DMA controller). In this case, the
    brief enable/disable cycle ends up gating the clock and further UART
    console output will halt the system completely.
    
    Avoid this by requesting the DMA channels before changing the clock
    state.
