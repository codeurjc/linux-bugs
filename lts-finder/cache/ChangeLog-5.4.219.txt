    wifi: mac80211: fix MBSSID parsing use-after-free
    
    Commit ff05d4b45dd89b922578dac497dcabf57cf771c6 upstream.
    This is a different version of the commit, changed to store
    the non-transmitted profile in the elems, and freeing it in
    the few places where it's relevant, since that is only the
    case when the last argument for parsing (the non-tx BSSID)
    is non-NULL.
    
    When we parse a multi-BSSID element, we might point some
    element pointers into the allocated nontransmitted_profile.
    However, we free this before returning, causing UAF when the
    relevant pointers in the parsed elements are accessed.
    
    Fix this by not allocating the scratch buffer separately but
    as part of the returned structure instead, that way, there
    are no lifetime issues with it.
    
    The scratch buffer introduction as part of the returned data
    here is taken from MLO feature work done by Ilan.
    
    This fixes CVE-2022-42719.

    wifi: mac80211: don't parse mbssid in assoc response
    
    This is simply not valid and simplifies the next commit.
    I'll make a separate patch for this in the current main
    tree as well.

    mac80211: mlme: find auth challenge directly
    
    There's no need to parse all elements etc. just to find the
    authentication challenge - use cfg80211_find_elem() instead.
    This also allows us to remove WLAN_EID_CHALLENGE handling
    from the element parsing entirely.

    Revert "fs: check FMODE_LSEEK to control internal pipe splicing"
    
    This reverts commit fd0a6e99b61e6c08fa5cf585d54fd956f70c73a6.
    
    Which was upstream commit 97ef77c52b789ec1411d360ed99dca1efe4b2c81.
    
    The commit is missing dependencies and breaks NFS tests, remove it for
    now.
