    USB: core: Don't hold device lock while reading the "descriptors" sysfs file
    
    commit 45bf39f8df7f05efb83b302c65ae3b9bc92b7065 upstream.
    
    Ever since commit 83e83ecb79a8 ("usb: core: get config and string
    descriptors for unauthorized devices") was merged in 2013, there has
    been no mechanism for reallocating the rawdescriptors buffers in
    struct usb_device after the initial enumeration.  Before that commit,
    the buffers would be deallocated when a device was deauthorized and
    reallocated when it was authorized and enumerated.
    
    This means that the locking in the read_descriptors() routine is not
    needed, since the buffers it reads will never be reallocated while the
    routine is running.  This locking can interfere with user programs
    trying to read a hub's descriptors via sysfs while new child devices
    of the hub are being initialized, since the hub is locked during this
    procedure.
    
    Since the locking in read_descriptors() hasn't been needed for over
    nine years, we can remove it.

    vc_screen: don't clobber return value in vcs_read
    
    commit ae3419fbac845b4d3f3a9fae4cc80c68d82cdf6e upstream.
    
    Commit 226fae124b2d ("vc_screen: move load of struct vc_data pointer in
    vcs_read() to avoid UAF") moved the call to vcs_vc() into the loop.
    
    While doing this it also moved the unconditional assignment of
    
            ret = -ENXIO;
    
    This unconditional assignment was valid outside the loop but within it
    it clobbers the actual value of ret.
    
    To avoid this only assign "ret = -ENXIO" when actually needed.
    
    [ Also, the 'goto unlock_out" needs to be just a "break", so that it
      does the right thing when it exits on later iterations when partial
      success has happened - Linus ]

    net: Remove WARN_ON_ONCE(sk->sk_forward_alloc) from sk_stream_kill_queues().
    
    commit 62ec33b44e0f7168ff2886520fec6fb62d03b5a3 upstream.
    
    Christoph Paasch reported that commit b5fc29233d28 ("inet6: Remove
    inet6_destroy_sock() in sk->sk_prot->destroy().") started triggering
    WARN_ON_ONCE(sk->sk_forward_alloc) in sk_stream_kill_queues().  [0 - 2]
    Also, we can reproduce it by a program in [3].
    
    In the commit, we delay freeing ipv6_pinfo.pktoptions from sk->destroy()
    to sk->sk_destruct(), so sk->sk_forward_alloc is no longer zero in
    inet_csk_destroy_sock().
    
    The same check has been in inet_sock_destruct() from at least v2.6,
    we can just remove the WARN_ON_ONCE().  However, among the users of
    sk_stream_kill_queues(), only CAIF is not calling inet_sock_destruct().
    Thus, we add the same WARN_ON_ONCE() to caif_sock_destructor().

    bpf: bpf_fib_lookup should not return neigh in NUD_FAILED state
    
    commit 1fe4850b34ab512ff911e2c035c75fb6438f7307 upstream.
    
    The bpf_fib_lookup() helper does not only look up the fib (ie. route)
    but it also looks up the neigh. Before returning the neigh, the helper
    does not check for NUD_VALID. When a neigh state (neigh->nud_state)
    is in NUD_FAILED, its dmac (neigh->ha) could be all zeros. The helper
    still returns SUCCESS instead of NO_NEIGH in this case. Because of the
    SUCCESS return value, the bpf prog directly uses the returned dmac
    and ends up filling all zero in the eth header.
    
    This patch checks for NUD_VALID and returns NO_NEIGH if the neigh is
    not valid.

    HID: core: Fix deadloop in hid_apply_multiplier.

    The initial value of hid->collection[].parent_idx if 0. When
    Report descriptor doesn't contain "HID Collection", the value
    remains as 0.
    
    In the meanwhile, when the Report descriptor fullfill
    all following conditions, it will trigger hid_apply_multiplier
    function call.
    1. Usage page is Generic Desktop Ctrls (0x01)
    2. Usage is RESOLUTION_MULTIPLIER (0x48)
    3. Contain any FEATURE items
    
    The while loop in hid_apply_multiplier will search the top-most
    collection by searching parent_idx == -1. Because all parent_idx
    is 0. The loop will run forever.
    
    There is a Report Descriptor triggerring the deadloop

    neigh: make sure used and confirmed times are valid
    
    [ Upstream commit c1d2ecdf5e38e3489ce8328238b558b3b2866fe1 ]
    
    Entries can linger in cache without timer for days, thanks to
    the gc_thresh1 limit. As result, without traffic, the confirmed
    time can be outdated and to appear to be in the future. Later,
    on traffic, NUD_STALE entries can switch to NUD_DELAY and start
    the timer which can see the invalid confirmed time and wrongly
    switch to NUD_REACHABLE state instead of NUD_PROBE. As result,
    timer is set many days in the future. This is more visible on
    32-bit platforms, with higher HZ value.
    
    Why this is a problem? While we expect unused entries to expire,
    such entries stay in REACHABLE state for too long, locked in
    cache. They are not expired normally, only when cache is full.
    
    Problem and the wrong state change reported by Zhang Changzhong:
    
    172.16.1.18 dev bond0 lladdr 0a:0e:0f:01:12:01 ref 1 used 350521/15994171/350520 probes 4 REACHABLE
    
    350520 seconds have elapsed since this entry was last updated, but it is
    still in the REACHABLE state (base_reachable_time_ms is 30000),
    preventing lladdr from being updated through probe.
    
    Fix it by ensuring timer is started with valid used/confirmed
    times. Considering the valid time range is LONG_MAX jiffies,
    we try not to go too much in the past while we are in
    DELAY/PROBE state. There are also places that need
    used/updated times to be validated while timer is not running.

    The arg->clone_sources_count is u64 and can trigger a warning when a
    huge value is passed from user space and a huge array is allocated.
    Limit the allocated memory to 8MiB (can be increased if needed), which
    in turn limits the number of clone sources to 8M / sizeof(struct
    clone_root) = 8M / 40 = 209715.  Real world number of clones is from
    tens to hundreds, so this is future proof.

    [ Upstream commit fb6df4366f86dd252bfa3049edffa52d17e7b895 ]
    
    Lockdep reports that acpi_nfit_shutdown() may deadlock against an
    opportune acpi_nfit_scrub(). acpi_nfit_scrub () is run from inside a
    'work' and therefore has already acquired workqueue-internal locks. It
    also acquiires acpi_desc->init_mutex. acpi_nfit_shutdown() first
    acquires init_mutex, and was subsequently attempting to cancel any
    pending workqueue items. This reversed locking order causes a potential
    deadlock:

        libndctl/1958 is trying to acquire lock:
        ffff888129b461c0 ((work_completion)(&(&acpi_desc->dwork)->work)){+.+.}-{0:0}, at: __flush_work+0x43/0x450
    
        but task is already holding lock:
        ffff888129b460e8 (&acpi_desc->init_mutex){+.+.}-{3:3}, at: acpi_nfit_shutdown+0x87/0xd0 [nfit]
    
        which lock already depends on the new lock.
    
        ...
    
        Possible unsafe locking scenario:
    
              CPU0                    CPU1
              ----                    ----
         lock(&acpi_desc->init_mutex);
                                      lock((work_completion)(&(&acpi_desc->dwork)->work));
                                      lock(&acpi_desc->init_mutex);
         lock((work_completion)(&(&acpi_desc->dwork)->work));
    
        *** DEADLOCK ***
    
    Since the workqueue manipulation is protected by its own internal locking,
    the cancellation of pending work doesn't need to be done under
    acpi_desc->init_mutex. Move cancel_delayed_work_sync() outside the
    init_mutex to fix the deadlock. Any work that starts after
    acpi_nfit_shutdown() drops the lock will see ARS_CANCEL, and the
    cancel_delayed_work_sync() will safely flush it out.

    ARM: dts: rockchip: add power-domains property to dp node on rk3288
    
    [ Upstream commit 80422339a75088322b4d3884bd12fa0fe5d11050 ]
    
    The clocks in the Rockchip rk3288 DisplayPort node are
    included in the power-domain@RK3288_PD_VIO logic, but the
    power-domains property in the dp node is missing, so fix it.

    arm64: dts: rockchip: drop unused LED mode property from rk3328-roc-cc
    
    [ Upstream commit 1692bffec674551163a7a4be32f59fdde04ecd27 ]
    
    GPIO LEDs do not have a 'mode' property:
    
      rockchip/rk3328-roc-pc.dtb: leds: led-0: Unevaluated properties are not allowed ('mode' was unexpected)
