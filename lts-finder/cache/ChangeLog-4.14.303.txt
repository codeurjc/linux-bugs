    nfc: pn533: Wait for out_urb's completion in pn533_usb_send_frame()
    
    [ Upstream commit 9dab880d675b9d0dd56c6428e4e8352a3339371d ]
    
    Fix a use-after-free that occurs in hcd when in_urb sent from
    pn533_usb_send_frame() is completed earlier than out_urb. Its callback
    frees the skb data in pn533_send_async_complete() that is used as a
    transfer buffer of out_urb. Wait before sending in_urb until the
    callback of out_urb is called. To modify the callback of out_urb alone,
    separate the complete function of out_urb and ack_urb.
    
    Found by a modified version of syzkaller.

    hvc/xen: lock console list traversal
    
    [ Upstream commit c0dccad87cf68fc6012aec7567e354353097ec1a ]
    
    The currently lockless access to the xen console list in
    vtermno_to_xencons() is incorrect, as additions and removals from the
    list can happen anytime, and as such the traversal of the list to get
    the private console data for a given termno needs to happen with the
    lock held.  Note users that modify the list already do so with the
    lock taken.
    
    Adjust current lock takers to use the _irq{save,restore} helpers,
    since the context in which vtermno_to_xencons() is called can have
    interrupts disabled.  Use the _irq{save,restore} set of helpers to
    switch the current callers to disable interrupts in the locked region.
    I haven't checked if existing users could instead use the _irq
    variant, as I think it's safer to use _irq{save,restore} upfront.
    
    While there switch from using list_for_each_entry_safe to
    list_for_each_entry: the current entry cursor won't be removed as
    part of the code in the loop body, so using the _safe variant is
    pointless.

    With 'GNU assembler (GNU Binutils for Debian) 2.39.90.20221231' the

    Which is due to:

      Note that with the dropped CMPSD and MOVSD Intel Syntax string insn
      templates taking operands, mixed IsString/non-IsString template groups
      (with memory operands) cannot occur anymore. With that

    Borislav Petkov further explains:
    
      " the particular problem here is is that the 'd' suffix is
        "conflicting" in the sense that you can have SSE mnemonics like movsD %xmm...
        and the same thing also for string ops (which is the case here) so apparently

        and phase out 'd' slowly... "

    The 0x153 version of the kbd backlight control SNC handle has no separate

    net/ulp: prevent ULP without clone op from entering the LISTEN status
    
    commit 2c02d41d71f90a5168391b6a5f2954112ba2307c upstream.
    
    When an ULP-enabled socket enters the LISTEN status, the listener ULP data
    pointer is copied inside the child/accepted sockets by sk_clone_lock().
    
    The relevant ULP can take care of de-duplicating the context pointer via
    the clone() operation, but only MPTCP and SMC implement such op.
    
    Other ULPs may end-up with a double-free at socket disposal time.
    
    We can't simply clear the ULP data at clone time, as TLS replaces the
    socket ops with custom ones assuming a valid TLS ULP context is
    available.
    
    Instead completely prevent clone-less ULP sockets from entering the
    LISTEN status.

    docs: Fix the docs build with Sphinx 6.0
    
    commit 0283189e8f3d0917e2ac399688df85211f48447b upstream.
    
    Sphinx 6.0 removed the execfile_() function, which we use as part of the
    configuration process.  They *did* warn us...  Just open-code the
    functionality as is done in Sphinx itself.
    
    Tested (using SPHINX_CONF, since this code is only executed with an
    alternative config file) on various Sphinx versions from 2.5 through 6.0.

    net: sched: disallow noqueue for qdisc classes
    
    commit 96398560f26aa07e8f2969d73c8197e6a6d10407 upstream.
    
    While experimenting with applying noqueue to a classful queue discipline,
    we discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the __dev_queue_xmit()
    path that generates a kernel OOPS:
    
        # dev=enp0s5
        # tc qdisc replace dev $dev root handle 1: htb default 1
        # tc class add dev $dev parent 1: classid 1:1 htb rate 10mbit
        # tc qdisc add dev $dev parent 1:1 handle 10: noqueue
        # ping -I $dev -w 1 -c 1 1.1.1.1

    Previously in commit d66d6c3152e8 ("net: sched: register noqueue
    qdisc"), NULL was set for the noqueue discipline on noqueue init
    so that __dev_queue_xmit() falls through for the noqueue case. This
    also sets a bypass of the enqueue NULL check in the
    register_qdisc() function for the struct noqueue_disc_ops.
    
    Classful queue disciplines make it past the NULL check in
    __dev_queue_xmit() because the discipline is set to htb (in this case),
    and then in the call to __dev_xmit_skb(), it calls into htb_enqueue()
    which grabs a leaf node for a class and then calls qdisc_enqueue() by
    passing in a queue discipline which assumes ->enqueue() is not set to NULL.
    
    Fix this by not allowing classes to be assigned to the noqueue
    discipline. Linux TC Notes states that classes cannot be set to
    the noqueue discipline. [1] Let's enforce that here.

    ravb: Fix "failed to switch device to config mode" message during unbind
    
    commit c72a7e42592b2e18d862cf120876070947000d7a upstream.
    
    This patch fixes the error "ravb 11c20000.ethernet eth0: failed to switch
    device to config mode" during unbind.
    
    We are doing register access after pm_runtime_put_sync().
    
    We usually do cleanup in reverse order of init. Currently in
    remove(), the "pm_runtime_put_sync" is not in reverse order.

    driver core: Fix bus_type.match() error handling in __driver_attach()
    
    commit 27c0d217340e47ec995557f61423ef415afba987 upstream.
    
    When a driver registers with a bus, it will attempt to match with every
    device on the bus through the __driver_attach() function. Currently, if
    the bus_type.match() function encounters an error that is not
    -EPROBE_DEFER, __driver_attach() will return a negative error code, which
    causes the driver registration logic to stop trying to match with the
    remaining devices on the bus.
    
    This behavior is not correct; a failure while matching a driver to a
    device does not mean that the driver won't be able to match and bind
    with other devices on the bus. Update the logic in __driver_attach()
    to reflect this.

    parisc: Align parisc MADV_XXX constants with all other architectures
    
    commit 71bdea6f798b425bc0003780b13e3fdecb16a010 upstream.
    
    Adjust some MADV_XXX constants to be in sync what their values are on
    all other platforms. There is currently no reason to have an own
    numbering on parisc, but it requires workarounds in many userspace
    sources (e.g. glibc, qemu, ...) - which are often forgotten and thus
    introduce bugs and different behaviour on parisc.
    
    A wrapper avoids an ABI breakage for existing userspace applications by
    translating any old values to the new ones, so this change allows us to
    move over all programs to the new ABI over time.

    hfs/hfsplus: avoid WARN_ON() for sanity check, use proper error handling
    
    commit cb7a95af78d29442b8294683eca4897544b8ef46 upstream.
    
    Commit 55d1cbbbb29e ("hfs/hfsplus: use WARN_ON for sanity check") fixed
    a build warning by turning a comment into a WARN_ON(), but it turns out
    that syzbot then complains because it can trigger said warning with a
    corrupted hfs image.
    
    The warning actually does warn about a bad situation, but we are much
    better off just handling it as the error it is.  So rather than warn
    about us doing bad things, stop doing the bad things and return -EIO.
    
    While at it, also fix a memory leak that was introduced by an earlier
    fix for a similar syzbot warning situation, and add a check for one case
    that historically wasn't handled at all (ie neither comment nor
    subsequent WARN_ON).

    commit 55d1cbbbb29e6656c662ee8f73ba1fc4777532eb upstream.
    
    gcc warns about a couple of instances in which a sanity check exists but
    the author wasn't sure how to react to it failing, which makes it look
    like a possible bug:

    panic() is probably not the correct choice here, but a WARN_ON
    seems appropriate and avoids the compile-time warning.

    nfsd: fix handling of readdir in v4root vs. mount upcall timeout
    
    commit cad853374d85fe678d721512cecfabd7636e51f3 upstream.
    
    If v4 READDIR operation hits a mountpoint and gets back an error,
    then it will include that entry in the reply and set RDATTR_ERROR for it
    to the error.
    
    That's fine for "normal" exported filesystems, but on the v4root, we
    need to be more careful to only expose the existence of dentries that
    lead to exports.
    
    If the mountd upcall times out while checking to see whether a
    mountpoint on the v4root is exported, then we have no recourse other
    than to fail the whole operation.

    usb: rndis_host: Secure rndis_query check against int overflow
    
    [ Upstream commit c7dd13805f8b8fc1ce3b6d40f6aff47e66b72ad2 ]
    
    Variables off and len typed as uint32 in rndis_query function
    are controlled by incoming RNDIS response message thus their
    value may be manipulated. Setting off to a unexpectetly large
    value will cause the sum with len and 8 to overflow and pass
    the implemented validation step. Consequently the response
    pointer will be referring to a location past the expected
    buffer boundaries allowing information leakage e.g. via
    RNDIS_OID_802_3_PERMANENT_ADDRESS OID.

    qlcnic: prevent ->dcb use-after-free on qlcnic_dcb_enable() failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 13a7c8964afcd8ca43c0b6001ebb0127baa95362 ]
    
    adapter->dcb would get silently freed inside qlcnic_dcb_enable() in
    case qlcnic_dcb_attach() would return an error, which always happens
    under OOM conditions. This would lead to use-after-free because both
    of the existing callers invoke qlcnic_dcb_get_info() on the obtained
    pointer, which is potentially freed at that point.
    
    Propagate errors from qlcnic_dcb_enable(), and instead free the dcb
    pointer at callsite using qlcnic_dcb_free(). This also removes the now
    unused qlcnic_clear_dcb_ops() helper, which was a simple wrapper around
    kfree() also causing memory leaks for partially initialized dcb.
    
    Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE
    static analysis tool.

    SUNRPC: ensure the matching upcall is in-flight upon downcall
    
    [ Upstream commit b18cba09e374637a0a3759d856a6bca94c133952 ]
    
    Commit 9130b8dbc6ac ("SUNRPC: allow for upcalls for the same uid
    but different gss service") introduced `auth` argument to
    __gss_find_upcall(), but in gss_pipe_downcall() it was left as NULL
    since it (and auth->service) was not (yet) determined.
    
    When multiple upcalls with the same uid and different service are
    ongoing, it could happen that __gss_find_upcall(), which returns the
    first match found in the pipe->in_downcall list, could not find the
    correct gss_msg corresponding to the downcall we are looking for.
    Moreover, it might return a msg which is not sent to rpc.gssd yet.
    
    We could see mount.nfs process hung in D state with multiple mount.nfs
    are executed in parallel.  The call trace below is of CentOS 7.9
    kernel-3.10.0-1160.24.1.el7.x86_64 but we observed the same hang w/
    elrepo kernel-ml-6.0.7-1.el7.
    
    PID: 71258  TASK: ffff91ebd4be0000  CPU: 36  COMMAND: "mount.nfs"
     #0 [ffff9203ca3234f8] __schedule at ffffffffa3b8899f

     #9 [ffff9203ca323820] rpc_execute at ffffffffc0420a48 [sunrpc]
    
    The scenario is like this. Let's say there are two upcalls for
    services A and B, A -> B in pipe->in_downcall, B -> A in pipe->pipe.
    
    When rpc.gssd reads pipe to get the upcall msg corresponding to
    service B from pipe->pipe and then writes the response, in
    gss_pipe_downcall the msg corresponding to service A will be picked
    because only uid is used to find the msg and it is before the one for
    B in pipe->in_downcall.  And the process waiting for the msg
    corresponding to service A will be woken up.
    
    Actual scheduing of that process might be after rpc.gssd processes the
    next msg.  In rpc_pipe_generic_upcall it clears msg->errno (for A).
    The process is scheduled to see gss_msg->ctx == NULL and
    gss_msg->msg.errno == 0, therefore it cannot break the loop in
    gss_create_upcall and is never woken up after that.
    
    This patch adds a simple check to ensure that a msg which is not
    sent to rpc.gssd yet is not chosen as the matching upcall upon
    receiving a downcall.

    ext4: allocate extended attribute value in vmalloc area
    
    commit cc12a6f25e07ed05d5825a1664b67a970842b2ca upstream.
    
    Now, extended attribute value maximum length is 64K. The memory
    requested here does not need continuous physical addresses, so it is
    appropriate to use kvmalloc to request memory. At the same time, it
    can also cope with the situation that the extended attribute will
    become longer in the future.

    When expanding inode space in ext4_expand_extra_isize_ea() we may need
    to allocate external xattr block. If quota is not initialized for the
    inode, the block allocation will not be accounted into quota usage. Make
    sure the quota is initialized before we try to expand inode space.

    This occurs in 'ext4_xattr_inode_create()'. If 'ext4_mark_inode_dirty()'

    ext4: avoid BUG_ON when creating xattrs
    
    commit b40ebaf63851b3a401b0dc9263843538f64f5ce6 upstream.
    
    Commit fb0a387dcdcd ("ext4: limit block allocations for indirect-block
    files to < 2^32") added code to try to allocate xattr block with 32-bit
    block number for indirect block based files on the grounds that these
    files cannot use larger block numbers. It also added BUG_ON when
    allocated block could not fit into 32 bits. This is however bogus
    reasoning because xattr block is stored in inode->i_file_acl and
    inode->i_file_acl_hi and as such even indirect block based files can
    happily use full 48 bits for xattr block number. The proper handling
    seems to be there basically since 64-bit block number support was added.
    So remove the bogus limitation and BUG_ON.

    In the above issue, ioctl invokes the swap_inode_boot_loader function to
    swap inode<5> and inode<12>. However, inode<5> contain incorrect imode and
    disordered extents, and i_nlink is set to 1. The extents check for inode in
    the ext4_iget function can be bypassed bacause 5 is EXT4_BOOT_LOADER_INO.
    While links_count is set to 1, the extents are not initialized in
    swap_inode_boot_loader. After the ioctl command is executed successfully,
    the extents are swapped to inode<12>, in this case, run the `cat` command
    to view inode<12>. And Bug_ON is triggered due to the incorrect extents.
    
    When the boot loader inode is not initialized, its imode can be one of the
    following:
    1) the imode is a bad type, which is marked as bad_inode in ext4_iget and
       set to S_IFREG.
    2) the imode is good type but not S_IFREG.
    3) the imode is S_IFREG.
    
    The BUG_ON may be triggered by bypassing the check in cases 1 and 2.
    Therefore, when the boot loader inode is bad_inode or its imode is not
    S_IFREG, initialize the inode to avoid triggering the BUG.

    ext4: add inode table check in __ext4_get_inode_loc to aovid possible infinite loop
    
    commit eee22187b53611e173161e38f61de1c7ecbeb876 upstream.
    
    In do_writepages, if the value returned by ext4_writepages is "-ENOMEM"
    and "wbc->sync_mode == WB_SYNC_ALL", retry until the condition is not met.
    
    In __ext4_get_inode_loc, if the bh returned by sb_getblk is NULL,
    the function returns -ENOMEM.
    
    In __getblk_slow, if the return value of grow_buffers is less than 0,
    the function returns NULL.
    
    When the three processes are connected in series like the following stack,
    an infinite loop may occur:
    
    do_writepages                                   <--- keep retrying
     ext4_writepages

          ext4_ext_handle_unwritten_extents
           ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized
            ext4_split_extent
             ext4_split_extent_at
              __ext4_ext_dirty
               __ext4_mark_inode_dirty
                ext4_reserve_inode_write
                 ext4_get_inode_loc
                  __ext4_get_inode_loc              <--- return -ENOMEM
                   sb_getblk
                    __getblk_gfp
                     __getblk_slow                  <--- return NULL
                      grow_buffers
                       grow_dev_page                <--- return -ENXIO
                        ret = (block < end_block) ? 1 : -ENXIO;
    
    In this issue, bg_inode_table_hi is overwritten as an incorrect value.
    As a result, `block < end_block` cannot be met in grow_dev_page.
    Therefore, __ext4_get_inode_loc always returns '-ENOMEM' and do_writepages
    keeps retrying. As a result, the writeback process is in the D state due
    to an infinite loop.
    
    Add a check on inode table block in the __ext4_get_inode_loc function by
    referring to ext4_read_inode_bitmap to avoid this infinite loop.

    commit 4cf949c7fafe21e085a4ee386bb2dade9067316e upstream.
    
    Invalid userspace dma surface copies could potentially overflow
    the memcpy from the surface to the snooped image leading to crashes.
    To fix it the dimensions of the copybox have to be validated
    against the expected size of the snooped cursor.

    drm/connector: send hotplug uevent on connector cleanup
    
    commit 6fdc2d490ea1369d17afd7e6eb66fecc5b7209bc upstream.
    
    A typical DP-MST unplug removes a KMS connector. However care must
    be taken to properly synchronize with user-space. The expected
    sequence of events is the following:
    
    1. The kernel notices that the DP-MST port is gone.
    2. The kernel marks the connector as disconnected, then sends a
       uevent to make user-space re-scan the connector list.
    3. User-space notices the connector goes from connected to disconnected,
       disables it.
    4. Kernel handles the IOCTL disabling the connector. On success,
       the very last reference to the struct drm_connector is dropped and
       drm_connector_cleanup() is called.
    5. The connector is removed from the list, and a uevent is sent to tell
       user-space that the connector disappeared.
    
    The very last step was missing. As a result, user-space thought the
    connector still existed and could try to disable it again. Since the
    kernel no longer knows about the connector, that would end up with
    EINVAL and confused user-space.
    
    Fix this by sending a hotplug uevent from drm_connector_cleanup().

    commit 5f18e9f8868c6d4eae71678e7ebd4977b7d8c8cf upstream.
    
    The second (UID) strcmp in acpi_dev_hid_uid_match considers
    "0" and "00" different, which can prevent device registration.
    
    Have the AMD IOMMU driver's ivrs_acpihid parsing code remove
    any leading zeroes to make the UID strcmp succeed.  Now users
    can safely specify "AMDxxxxx:00" or "AMDxxxxx:0" and expect
    the same behaviour.

    PCI/sysfs: Fix double free in error path
    
    commit aa382ffa705bea9931ec92b6f3c70e1fdb372195 upstream.
    
    When pci_create_attr() fails, pci_remove_resource_files() is called which
    will iterate over the res_attr[_wc] arrays and frees every non NULL entry.
    To avoid a double free here set the array entry only after it's clear we
    successfully initialized it.
    
    Fixes: b562ec8f74e4 ("PCI: Don't leak memory if sysfs_create_bin_file() fails")

    PCI: Fix pci_device_is_present() for VFs by checking PF
    
    commit 98b04dd0b4577894520493d96bc4623387767445 upstream.
    
    pci_device_is_present() previously didn't work for VFs because it reads the
    Vendor and Device ID, which are 0xffff for VFs, which looks like they
    aren't present.  Check the PF instead.
    
    Wei Gong reported that if virtio I/O is in progress when the driver is
    unbound or "0" is written to /sys/.../sriov_numvfs, the virtio I/O
    operation hangs, which may result in output like this:
    
      task:bash state:D stack:    0 pid: 1773 ppid:  1241 flags:0x00004002
      Call Trace:

       virtio_pci_remove+0x41/0x80
       pci_device_remove+0x3e/0xb0
    
    This happened because pci_device_is_present(VF) returned "false" in
    virtio_pci_remove(), so it called virtio_break_device().  The broken vq
    meant that vring_interrupt() skipped the vq.callback() that would have
    completed the virtio I/O operation via virtblk_done().

    media: dvb-core: Fix UAF due to refcount races at releasing
    
    commit fd3d91ab1c6ab0628fe642dd570b56302c30a792 upstream.
    
    The dvb-core tries to sync the releases of opened files at
    dvb_dmxdev_release() with two refcounts: dvbdev->users and
    dvr_dvbdev->users.  A problem is present in those two syncs: when yet
    another dvb_demux_open() is called during those sync waits,
    dvb_demux_open() continues to process even if the device is being
    closed.  This includes the increment of the former refcount, resulting
    in the leftover refcount after the sync of the latter refcount at
    dvb_dmxdev_release().  It ends up with use-after-free, since the
    function believes that all usages were gone and releases the
    resources.
    
    This patch addresses the problem by adding the check of dmxdev->exit
    flag at dvb_demux_open(), just like dvb_dvr_open() already does.  With
    the exit flag check, the second call of dvb_demux_open() fails, hence
    the further corruption can be avoided.
    
    Also for avoiding the races of the dmxdev->exit flag reference, this
    patch serializes the dmxdev->exit set up and the sync waits with the
    dmxdev->mutex lock at dvb_dmxdev_release().  Without the mutex lock,
    dvb_demux_open() (or dvb_dvr_open()) may run concurrently with
    dvb_dmxdev_release(), which allows to skip the exit flag check and
    continue the open process that is being closed.
    
    CVE-2022-41218 is assigned to those bugs above.

    media: dvb-core: Fix double free in dvb_register_device()
    
    commit 6b0d0477fce747d4137aa65856318b55fba72198 upstream.
    
    In function dvb_register_device() -> dvb_register_media_device() ->
    dvb_create_media_entity(), dvb->entity is allocated and initialized. If
    the initialization fails, it frees the dvb->entity, and return an error
    code. The caller takes the error code and handles the error by calling
    dvb_media_device_free(), which unregisters the entity and frees the
    field again if it is not NULL. As dvb->entity may not NULLed in
    dvb_create_media_entity() when the allocation of dvbdev->pad fails, a
    double free may occur. This may also cause an Use After free in
    media_device_unregister_entity().
    
    Fix this by storing NULL to dvb->entity when it is freed.

    ARM: 9256/1: NWFPE: avoid compiler-generated __aeabi_uldivmod
    
    commit 3220022038b9a3845eea762af85f1c5694b9f861 upstream.
    
    clang-15's ability to elide loops completely became more aggressive when
    it can deduce how a variable is being updated in a loop. Counting down
    one variable by an increment of another can be replaced by a modulo
    operation.
    
    For 64b variables on 32b ARM EABI targets, this can result in the
    compiler generating calls to __aeabi_uldivmod, which it does for a do
    while loop in float64_rem().
    
    For the kernel, we'd generally prefer that developers not open code 64b
    division via binary / operators and instead use the more explicit
    helpers from div64.h. On arm-linux-gnuabi targets, failure to do so can
    result in linkage failures due to undefined references to
    __aeabi_uldivmod().
    
    While developers can avoid open coding divisions on 64b variables, the
    compiler doesn't know that the Linux kernel has a partial implementation
    of a compiler runtime (--rtlib) to enforce this convention.
    
    It's also undecidable for the compiler whether the code in question
    would be faster to execute the loop vs elide it and do the 64b division.
    
    While I actively avoid using the internal -mllvm command line flags, I
    think we get better code than using barrier() here, which will force
    reloads+spills in the loop for all toolchains.

            time out
    __do_softirq
      run_timer_softirq # pool has already been freed
    
    This can be easily reproduced using:
      1. create thin-pool
      2. dmsetup suspend pool
      3. dmsetup resume pool
      4. dmsetup remove_all # Concurrent with 3
    
    The root cause of this UAF bug is that dm_resume() adds timer after
    dm_destroy() skips cancelling the timer because of suspend status.
    After timeout, it will call run_timer_softirq(), however pool has
    already been freed. The concurrency UAF bug will happen.
    
    Therefore, cancelling timer again in __pool_destroy().

    dm thin: Use last transaction's pmd->root when commit failed
    
    commit 7991dbff6849f67e823b7cc0c15e5a90b0549b9f upstream.
    
    Recently we found a softlock up problem in dm thin pool btree lookup
    code due to corrupted metadata:
    
     Kernel panic - not syncing: softlockup: hung tasks

    Following process may generate a broken btree mixed with fresh and
    stale btree nodes, which could get dm thin trapped in an infinite loop
    while looking up data block:
     Transaction 1: pmd->root = A, A->B->C   // One path in btree
                    pmd->root = X, X->Y->Z   // Copy-up
     Transaction 2: X,Z is updated on disk, Y write failed.
                    // Commit failed, dm thin becomes read-only.
                    process_bio_read_only
                     dm_thin_find_block
                      __find_block
                       dm_btree_lookup(pmd->root)
    The pmd->root points to a broken btree, Y may contain stale node
    pointing to any block, for example X, which gets dm thin trapped into
    a dead loop while looking up Z.
    
    Fix this by setting pmd->root in __open_metadata(), so that dm thin
    will use the last transaction's pmd->root if commit failed.

    selftests: Use optional USERCFLAGS and USERLDFLAGS
    
    commit de3ee3f63400a23954e7c1ad1cb8c20f29ab6fe3 upstream.
    
    This change enables to extend CFLAGS and LDFLAGS from command line, e.g.
    to extend compiler checks: make USERCFLAGS=-Werror USERLDFLAGS=-static
    
    USERCFLAGS and USERLDFLAGS are documented in
    Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.rst and Documentation/kbuild/kbuild.rst
    
    This should be backported (down to 5.10) to improve previous kernel
    versions testing as well.

    ARM: ux500: do not directly dereference __iomem
    
    commit 65b0e307a1a9193571db12910f382f84195a3d29 upstream.
    
    Sparse reports that calling add_device_randomness() on `uid` is a
    violation of address spaces. And indeed the next usage uses readl()
    properly, but that was left out when passing it toadd_device_
    randomness(). So instead copy the whole thing to the stack first.

    ktest.pl minconfig: Unset configs instead of just removing them
    
    commit ef784eebb56425eed6e9b16e7d47e5c00dcf9c38 upstream.
    
    After a full run of a make_min_config test, I noticed there were a lot of
    CONFIGs still enabled that really should not be. Looking at them, I
    noticed they were all defined as "default y". The issue is that the test
    simple removes the config and re-runs make oldconfig, which enables it
    again because it is set to default 'y'. Instead, explicitly disable the
    config with writing "# CONFIG_FOO is not set" to the file to keep it from
    being set again.
    
    With this change, one of my box's minconfigs went from 768 configs set,
    down to 521 configs set.

    media: stv0288: use explicitly signed char
    
    commit 7392134428c92a4cb541bd5c8f4f5c8d2e88364d upstream.
    
    With char becoming unsigned by default, and with `char` alone being
    ambiguous and based on architecture, signed chars need to be marked
    explicitly as such. Use `s8` and `u8` types here, since that's what
    surrounding code does. This fixes:

    md: fix a crash in mempool_free
    
    commit 341097ee53573e06ab9fc675d96a052385b851fa upstream.
    
    There's a crash in mempool_free when running the lvm test
    shell/lvchange-rebuild-raid.sh.
    
    The reason for the crash is this:
    * super_written calls atomic_dec_and_test(&mddev->pending_writes) and
      wake_up(&mddev->sb_wait). Then it calls rdev_dec_pending(rdev, mddev)
      and bio_put(bio).
    * so, the process that waited on sb_wait and that is woken up is racing
      with bio_put(bio).
    * if the process wins the race, it calls bioset_exit before bio_put(bio)
      is executed.
    * bio_put(bio) attempts to free a bio into a destroyed bio set - causing
      a crash in mempool_free.
    
    We fix this bug by moving bio_put before atomic_dec_and_test.
    
    We also move rdev_dec_pending before atomic_dec_and_test as suggested by
    Neil Brown.
    
    The function md_end_flush has a similar bug - we must call bio_put before
    we decrement the number of in-progress bios.

    pnode: terminate at peers of source
    
    commit 11933cf1d91d57da9e5c53822a540bbdc2656c16 upstream.
    
    The propagate_mnt() function handles mount propagation when creating
    mounts and propagates the source mount tree @source_mnt to all
    applicable nodes of the destination propagation mount tree headed by
    @dest_mnt.
    
    Unfortunately it contains a bug where it fails to terminate at peers of
    @source_mnt when looking up copies of the source mount that become
    masters for copies of the source mount tree mounted on top of slaves in
    the destination propagation tree causing a NULL dereference.
    
    Once the mechanics of the bug are understood it's easy to trigger.
    Because of unprivileged user namespaces it is available to unprivileged
    users.
    
    While fixing this bug we've gotten confused multiple times due to
    unclear terminology or missing concepts. So let's start this with some
    clarifications:
    
    * The terms "master" or "peer" denote a shared mount. A shared mount
      belongs to a peer group.
    
    * A peer group is a set of shared mounts that propagate to each other.
      They are identified by a peer group id. The peer group id is available
      in @shared_mnt->mnt_group_id.
      Shared mounts within the same peer group have the same peer group id.
      The peers in a peer group can be reached via @shared_mnt->mnt_share.
    
    * The terms "slave mount" or "dependent mount" denote a mount that
      receives propagation from a peer in a peer group. IOW, shared mounts
      may have slave mounts and slave mounts have shared mounts as their
      master. Slave mounts of a given peer in a peer group are listed on
      that peers slave list available at @shared_mnt->mnt_slave_list.
    
    * The term "master mount" denotes a mount in a peer group. IOW, it
      denotes a shared mount or a peer mount in a peer group. The term
      "master mount" - or "master" for short - is mostly used when talking
      in the context of slave mounts that receive propagation from a master
      mount. A master mount of a slave identifies the closest peer group a
      slave mount receives propagation from. The master mount of a slave can
      be identified via @slave_mount->mnt_master. Different slaves may point
      to different masters in the same peer group.
    
    * Multiple peers in a peer group can have non-empty ->mnt_slave_lists.
      Non-empty ->mnt_slave_lists of peers don't intersect. Consequently, to
      ensure all slave mounts of a peer group are visited the
      ->mnt_slave_lists of all peers in a peer group have to be walked.
    
    * Slave mounts point to a peer in the closest peer group they receive
      propagation from via @slave_mnt->mnt_master (see above). Together with
      these peers they form a propagation group (see below). The closest
      peer group can thus be identified through the peer group id
      @slave_mnt->mnt_master->mnt_group_id of the peer/master that a slave
      mount receives propagation from.
    
    * A shared-slave mount is a slave mount to a peer group pg1 while also
      a peer in another peer group pg2. IOW, a peer group may receive
      propagation from another peer group.
    
      If a peer group pg1 is a slave to another peer group pg2 then all
      peers in peer group pg1 point to the same peer in peer group pg2 via
      ->mnt_master. IOW, all peers in peer group pg1 appear on the same
      ->mnt_slave_list. IOW, they cannot be slaves to different peer groups.
    
    * A pure slave mount is a slave mount that is a slave to a peer group
      but is not a peer in another peer group.
    
    * A propagation group denotes the set of mounts consisting of a single
      peer group pg1 and all slave mounts and shared-slave mounts that point
      to a peer in that peer group via ->mnt_master. IOW, all slave mounts
      such that @slave_mnt->mnt_master->mnt_group_id is equal to
      @shared_mnt->mnt_group_id.
    
      The concept of a propagation group makes it easier to talk about a
      single propagation level in a propagation tree.
    
      For example, in propagate_mnt() the immediate peers of @dest_mnt and
      all slaves of @dest_mnt's peer group form a propagation group propg1.
      So a shared-slave mount that is a slave in propg1 and that is a peer
      in another peer group pg2 forms another propagation group propg2
      together with all slaves that point to that shared-slave mount in
      their ->mnt_master.
    
    * A propagation tree refers to all mounts that receive propagation
      starting from a specific shared mount.
    
      For example, for propagate_mnt() @dest_mnt is the start of a
      propagation tree. The propagation tree ecompasses all mounts that
      receive propagation from @dest_mnt's peer group down to the leafs.
    
    With that out of the way let's get to the actual algorithm.
    
    We know that @dest_mnt is guaranteed to be a pure shared mount or a
    shared-slave mount. This is guaranteed by a check in
    attach_recursive_mnt(). So propagate_mnt() will first propagate the
    source mount tree to all peers in @dest_mnt's peer group:
    
    for (n = next_peer(dest_mnt); n != dest_mnt; n = next_peer(n)) {
            ret = propagate_one(n);
            if (ret)
                   goto out;
    }
    
    Notice, that the peer propagation loop of propagate_mnt() doesn't
    propagate @dest_mnt itself. @dest_mnt is mounted directly in
    attach_recursive_mnt() after we propagated to the destination
    propagation tree.
    
    The mount that will be mounted on top of @dest_mnt is @source_mnt. This
    copy was created earlier even before we entered attach_recursive_mnt()
    and doesn't concern us a lot here.
    
    It's just important to notice that when propagate_mnt() is called
    @source_mnt will not yet have been mounted on top of @dest_mnt. Thus,
    @source_mnt->mnt_parent will either still point to @source_mnt or - in
    the case @source_mnt is moved and thus already attached - still to its
    former parent.
    
    For each peer @m in @dest_mnt's peer group propagate_one() will create a
    new copy of the source mount tree and mount that copy @child on @m such
    that @child->mnt_parent points to @m after propagate_one() returns.
    
    propagate_one() will stash the last destination propagation node @m in
    @last_dest and the last copy it created for the source mount tree in
    @last_source.
    
    Hence, if we call into propagate_one() again for the next destination
    propagation node @m, @last_dest will point to the previous destination
    propagation node and @last_source will point to the previous copy of the
    source mount tree and mounted on @last_dest.
    
    Each new copy of the source mount tree is created from the previous copy
    of the source mount tree. This will become important later.
    
    The peer loop in propagate_mnt() is straightforward. We iterate through
    the peers copying and updating @last_source and @last_dest as we go
    through them and mount each copy of the source mount tree @child on a
    peer @m in @dest_mnt's peer group.
    
    After propagate_mnt() handled the peers in @dest_mnt's peer group
    propagate_mnt() will propagate the source mount tree down the
    propagation tree that @dest_mnt's peer group propagates to:
    
    for (m = next_group(dest_mnt, dest_mnt); m;
                    m = next_group(m, dest_mnt)) {
            /* everything in that slave group */
            n = m;
            do {
                    ret = propagate_one(n);
                    if (ret)
                            goto out;
                    n = next_peer(n);
            } while (n != m);
    }
    
    The next_group() helper will recursively walk the destination
    propagation tree, descending into each propagation group of the
    propagation tree.
    
    The important part is that it takes care to propagate the source mount
    tree to all peers in the peer group of a propagation group before it
    propagates to the slaves to those peers in the propagation group. IOW,
    it creates and mounts copies of the source mount tree that become
    masters before it creates and mounts copies of the source mount tree
    that become slaves to these masters.
    
    It is important to remember that propagating the source mount tree to
    each mount @m in the destination propagation tree simply means that we
    create and mount new copies @child of the source mount tree on @m such
    that @child->mnt_parent points to @m.
    
    Since we know that each node @m in the destination propagation tree
    headed by @dest_mnt's peer group will be overmounted with a copy of the
    source mount tree and since we know that the propagation properties of
    each copy of the source mount tree we create and mount at @m will mostly
    mirror the propagation properties of @m. We can use that information to
    create and mount the copies of the source mount tree that become masters
    before their slaves.
    
    The easy case is always when @m and @last_dest are peers in a peer group
    of a given propagation group. In that case we know that we can simply
    copy @last_source without having to figure out what the master for the
    new copy @child of the source mount tree needs to be as we've done that
    in a previous call to propagate_one().
    
    The hard case is when we're dealing with a slave mount or a shared-slave
    mount @m in a destination propagation group that we need to create and
    mount a copy of the source mount tree on.
    
    For each propagation group in the destination propagation tree we
    propagate the source mount tree to we want to make sure that the copies
    @child of the source mount tree we create and mount on slaves @m pick an
    ealier copy of the source mount tree that we mounted on a master @m of
    the destination propagation group as their master. This is a mouthful
    but as far as we can tell that's the core of it all.
    
    But, if we keep track of the masters in the destination propagation tree
    @m we can use the information to find the correct master for each copy
    of the source mount tree we create and mount at the slaves in the
    destination propagation tree @m.
    
    Let's walk through the base case as that's still fairly easy to grasp.
    
    If we're dealing with the first slave in the propagation group that
    @dest_mnt is in then we don't yet have marked any masters in the
    destination propagation tree.
    
    We know the master for the first slave to @dest_mnt's peer group is
    simple @dest_mnt. So we expect this algorithm to yield a copy of the
    source mount tree that was mounted on a peer in @dest_mnt's peer group
    as the master for the copy of the source mount tree we want to mount at
    the first slave @m:
    
    for (n = m; ; n = p) {
            p = n->mnt_master;
            if (p == dest_master || IS_MNT_MARKED(p))
                    break;
    }
    
    For the first slave we walk the destination propagation tree all the way
    up to a peer in @dest_mnt's peer group. IOW, the propagation hierarchy
    can be walked by walking up the @mnt->mnt_master hierarchy of the
    destination propagation tree @m. We will ultimately find a peer in
    @dest_mnt's peer group and thus ultimately @dest_mnt->mnt_master.
    
    Btw, here the assumption we listed at the beginning becomes important.
    Namely, that peers in a peer group pg1 that are slaves in another peer
    group pg2 appear on the same ->mnt_slave_list. IOW, all slaves who are
    peers in peer group pg1 point to the same peer in peer group pg2 via
    their ->mnt_master. Otherwise the termination condition in the code
    above would be wrong and next_group() would be broken too.
    
    So the first iteration sets:
    
    n = m;
    p = n->mnt_master;
    
    such that @p now points to a peer or @dest_mnt itself. We walk up one
    more level since we don't have any marked mounts. So we end up with:
    
    n = dest_mnt;
    p = dest_mnt->mnt_master;
    
    If @dest_mnt's peer group is not slave to another peer group then @p is
    now NULL. If @dest_mnt's peer group is a slave to another peer group
    then @p now points to @dest_mnt->mnt_master points which is a master
    outside the propagation tree we're dealing with.
    
    Now we need to figure out the master for the copy of the source mount
    tree we're about to create and mount on the first slave of @dest_mnt's
    peer group:
    
    do {
            struct mount *parent = last_source->mnt_parent;
            if (last_source == first_source)
                    break;
            done = parent->mnt_master == p;
            if (done && peers(n, parent))
                    break;
            last_source = last_source->mnt_master;
    } while (!done);
    
    We know that @last_source->mnt_parent points to @last_dest and
    @last_dest is the last peer in @dest_mnt's peer group we propagated to
    in the peer loop in propagate_mnt().
    
    Consequently, @last_source is the last copy we created and mount on that
    last peer in @dest_mnt's peer group. So @last_source is the master we
    want to pick.
    
    We know that @last_source->mnt_parent->mnt_master points to
    @last_dest->mnt_master. We also know that @last_dest->mnt_master is
    either NULL or points to a master outside of the destination propagation
    tree and so does @p. Hence:
    
    done = parent->mnt_master == p;
    
    is trivially true in the base condition.
    
    We also know that for the first slave mount of @dest_mnt's peer group
    that @last_dest either points @dest_mnt itself because it was
    initialized to:
    
    last_dest = dest_mnt;
    
    at the beginning of propagate_mnt() or it will point to a peer of
    @dest_mnt in its peer group. In both cases it is guaranteed that on the
    first iteration @n and @parent are peers (Please note the check for
    peers here as that's important.):
    
    if (done && peers(n, parent))
            break;
    
    So, as we expected, we select @last_source, which referes to the last
    copy of the source mount tree we mounted on the last peer in @dest_mnt's
    peer group, as the master of the first slave in @dest_mnt's peer group.
    The rest is taken care of by clone_mnt(last_source, ...). We'll skip
    over that part otherwise this becomes a blogpost.
    
    At the end of propagate_mnt() we now mark @m->mnt_master as the first
    master in the destination propagation tree that is distinct from
    @dest_mnt->mnt_master. IOW, we mark @dest_mnt itself as a master.
    
    By marking @dest_mnt or one of it's peers we are able to easily find it
    again when we later lookup masters for other copies of the source mount
    tree we mount copies of the source mount tree on slaves @m to
    @dest_mnt's peer group. This, in turn allows us to find the master we
    selected for the copies of the source mount tree we mounted on master in
    the destination propagation tree again.
    
    The important part is to realize that the code makes use of the fact
    that the last copy of the source mount tree stashed in @last_source was
    mounted on top of the previous destination propagation node @last_dest.
    What this means is that @last_source allows us to walk the destination
    propagation hierarchy the same way each destination propagation node @m
    does.
    
    If we take @last_source, which is the copy of @source_mnt we have
    mounted on @last_dest in the previous iteration of propagate_one(), then
    we know @last_source->mnt_parent points to @last_dest but we also know
    that as we walk through the destination propagation tree that
    @last_source->mnt_master will point to an earlier copy of the source
    mount tree we mounted one an earlier destination propagation node @m.
    
    IOW, @last_source->mnt_parent will be our hook into the destination
    propagation tree and each consecutive @last_source->mnt_master will lead
    us to an earlier propagation node @m via
    @last_source->mnt_master->mnt_parent.
    
    Hence, by walking up @last_source->mnt_master, each of which is mounted
    on a node that is a master @m in the destination propagation tree we can
    also walk up the destination propagation hierarchy.
    
    So, for each new destination propagation node @m we use the previous
    copy of @last_source and the fact it's mounted on the previous
    propagation node @last_dest via @last_source->mnt_master->mnt_parent to
    determine what the master of the new copy of @last_source needs to be.
    
    The goal is to find the _closest_ master that the new copy of the source
    mount tree we are about to create and mount on a slave @m in the
    destination propagation tree needs to pick. IOW, we want to find a
    suitable master in the propagation group.
    
    As the propagation structure of the source mount propagation tree we
    create mirrors the propagation structure of the destination propagation
    tree we can find @m's closest master - i.e., a marked master - which is
    a peer in the closest peer group that @m receives propagation from. We
    store that closest master of @m in @p as before and record the slave to
    that master in @n
    
    We then search for this master @p via @last_source by walking up the
    master hierarchy starting from the last copy of the source mount tree
    stored in @last_source that we created and mounted on the previous
    destination propagation node @m.
    
    We will try to find the master by walking @last_source->mnt_master and
    by comparing @last_source->mnt_master->mnt_parent->mnt_master to @p. If
    we find @p then we can figure out what earlier copy of the source mount
    tree needs to be the master for the new copy of the source mount tree
    we're about to create and mount at the current destination propagation
    node @m.
    
    If @last_source->mnt_master->mnt_parent and @n are peers then we know
    that the closest master they receive propagation from is
    @last_source->mnt_master->mnt_parent->mnt_master. If not then the
    closest immediate peer group that they receive propagation from must be
    one level higher up.
    
    This builds on the earlier clarification at the beginning that all peers
    in a peer group which are slaves of other peer groups all point to the
    same ->mnt_master, i.e., appear on the same ->mnt_slave_list, of the
    closest peer group that they receive propagation from.
    
    However, terminating the walk has corner cases.
    
    If the closest marked master for a given destination node @m cannot be
    found by walking up the master hierarchy via @last_source->mnt_master
    then we need to terminate the walk when we encounter @source_mnt again.
    
    This isn't an arbitrary termination. It simply means that the new copy
    of the source mount tree we're about to create has a copy of the source
    mount tree we created and mounted on a peer in @dest_mnt's peer group as
    its master. IOW, @source_mnt is the peer in the closest peer group that
    the new copy of the source mount tree receives propagation from.
    
    We absolutely have to stop @source_mnt because @last_source->mnt_master
    either points outside the propagation hierarchy we're dealing with or it
    is NULL because @source_mnt isn't a shared-slave.
    
    So continuing the walk past @source_mnt would cause a NULL dereference
    via @last_source->mnt_master->mnt_parent. And so we have to stop the
    walk when we encounter @source_mnt again.
    
    One scenario where this can happen is when we first handled a series of
    slaves of @dest_mnt's peer group and then encounter peers in a new peer
    group that is a slave to @dest_mnt's peer group. We handle them and then
    we encounter another slave mount to @dest_mnt that is a pure slave to
    @dest_mnt's peer group. That pure slave will have a peer in @dest_mnt's
    peer group as its master. Consequently, the new copy of the source mount
    tree will need to have @source_mnt as it's master. So we walk the
    propagation hierarchy all the way up to @source_mnt based on
    @last_source->mnt_master.
    
    So terminate on @source_mnt, easy peasy. Except, that the check misses
    something that the rest of the algorithm already handles.
    
    If @dest_mnt has peers in it's peer group the peer loop in
    propagate_mnt():
    
    for (n = next_peer(dest_mnt); n != dest_mnt; n = next_peer(n)) {
            ret = propagate_one(n);
            if (ret)
                    goto out;
    }
    
    will consecutively update @last_source with each previous copy of the
    source mount tree we created and mounted at the previous peer in
    @dest_mnt's peer group. So after that loop terminates @last_source will
    point to whatever copy of the source mount tree was created and mounted
    on the last peer in @dest_mnt's peer group.
    
    Furthermore, if there is even a single additional peer in @dest_mnt's
    peer group then @last_source will __not__ point to @source_mnt anymore.
    Because, as we mentioned above, @dest_mnt isn't even handled in this
    loop but directly in attach_recursive_mnt(). So it can't even accidently
    come last in that peer loop.
    
    So the first time we handle a slave mount @m of @dest_mnt's peer group
    the copy of the source mount tree we create will make the __last copy of
    the source mount tree we created and mounted on the last peer in
    @dest_mnt's peer group the master of the new copy of the source mount
    tree we create and mount on the first slave of @dest_mnt's peer group__.
    
    But this means that the termination condition that checks for
    @source_mnt is wrong. The @source_mnt cannot be found anymore by
    propagate_one(). Instead it will find the last copy of the source mount
    tree we created and mounted for the last peer of @dest_mnt's peer group
    again. And that is a peer of @source_mnt not @source_mnt itself.
    
    IOW, we fail to terminate the loop correctly and ultimately dereference
    @last_source->mnt_master->mnt_parent. When @source_mnt's peer group
    isn't slave to another peer group then @last_source->mnt_master is NULL
    causing the splat below.
    
    For example, assume @dest_mnt is a pure shared mount and has three peers
    in its peer group:

    After this sequence has been processed @last_source will point to (P3),
    the copy generated for the third peer in @dest_mnt's peer group we
    handled. So the copy of the source mount tree (P4) we create and mount
    on the first slave of @dest_mnt's peer group:
    
    ===================================================================================
                                             mount-id   mount-parent-id   peer-group-id
    ===================================================================================
        mnt_master[216]                      309        297               shared:216

      \
       \    (P3) mnt_master[218]             626        545               shared:218
        \  /
         \/
        (P4) mnt_slave                       627        483               master:218
    
    will pick the last copy of the source mount tree (P3) as master, not (S0).
    
    When walking the propagation hierarchy via @last_source's master
    hierarchy we encounter (P3) but not (S0), i.e., @source_mnt.
    
    We can fix this in multiple ways:
    
    (1) By setting @last_source to @source_mnt after we processed the peers
        in @dest_mnt's peer group right after the peer loop in
        propagate_mnt().
    
    (2) By changing the termination condition that relies on finding exactly
        @source_mnt to finding a peer of @source_mnt.
    
    (3) By only moving @last_source when we actually venture into a new peer
        group or some clever variant thereof.
    
    The first two options are minimally invasive and what we want as a fix.
    The third option is more intrusive but something we'd like to explore in
    the near future.
    
    This passes all LTP tests and specifically the mount propagation
    testsuite part of it. It also holds up against all known reproducers of
    this issues.
    
    Final words.
    First, this is a clever but __worringly__ underdocumented algorithm.
    There isn't a single detailed comment to be found in next_group(),
    propagate_one() or anywhere else in that file for that matter. This has
    been a giant pain to understand and work through and a bug like this is
    insanely difficult to fix without a detailed understanding of what's
    happening. Let's not talk about the amount of time that was sunk into
    fixing this.
    
    Second, all the cool kids with access to
    unshare --mount --user --map-root --propagation=unchanged
    are going to have a lot of fun. IOW, triggerable by unprivileged users
    while namespace_lock() lock is held.

    commit 8508fa2e7472f673edbeedf1b1d2b7a6bb898ecc upstream.
    
    A PODxt device sends 0xb2, 0xc2 or 0xf2 as a status byte for MIDI
    messages over USB that should otherwise have a 0xb0, 0xc0 or 0xf0
    status byte. This is usually corrected by the driver on other OSes.
    
    This fixes MIDI sysex messages sent by PODxt.

    HID: plantronics: Additional PIDs for double volume key presses quirk
    
    [ Upstream commit 3d57f36c89d8ba32b2c312f397a37fd1a2dc7cfc ]
    
    I no longer work for Plantronics (aka Poly, aka HP) and do not have
    access to the headsets in order to test. However, as noted by Maxim,
    the other 32xx models that share the same base code set as the 3220
    would need the same quirk. This patch adds the PIDs for the rest of
    the Blackwire 32XX product family that require the quirk.
    
    Plantronics Blackwire 3210 Series (047f:c055)
    Plantronics Blackwire 3215 Series (047f:c057)
    Plantronics Blackwire 3225 Series (047f:c058)
    
    Quote from previous patch by Maxim Mikityanskiy
    Plantronics Blackwire 3220 Series (047f:c056) sends HID reports twice
    for each volume key press. This patch adds a quirk to hid-plantronics
    for this product ID, which will ignore the second volume key press if
    it happens within 5 ms from the last one that was handled.
    
    The patch was tested on the mentioned model only, it shouldn't affect
    other models, however, this quirk might be needed for them too.
    Auto-repeat (when a key is held pressed) is not affected, because the
    rate is about 3 times per second, which is far less frequent than once
    in 5 ms.

    powerpc/rtas: avoid device tree lookups in rtas_os_term()
    
    [ Upstream commit ed2213bfb192ab51f09f12e9b49b5d482c6493f3 ]
    
    rtas_os_term() is called during panic. Its behavior depends on a couple
    of conditions in the /rtas node of the device tree, the traversal of
    which entails locking and local IRQ state changes. If the kernel panics
    while devtree_lock is held, rtas_os_term() as currently written could
    hang.
    
    Instead of discovering the relevant characteristics at panic time,
    cache them in file-static variables at boot. Note the lookup for
    "ibm,extended-os-term" is converted to of_property_read_bool() since it
    is a boolean property, not an RTAS function token.

    reiserfs: Add missing calls to reiserfs_security_free()
    
    commit 572302af1258459e124437b8f3369357447afac7 upstream.
    
    Commit 57fe60df6241 ("reiserfs: add atomic addition of selinux attributes
    during inode creation") defined reiserfs_security_free() to free the name
    and value of a security xattr allocated by the active LSM through
    security_old_inode_init_security(). However, this function is not called
    in the reiserfs code.
    
    Thus, add a call to reiserfs_security_free() whenever
    reiserfs_security_init() is called, and initialize value to NULL, to avoid
    to call kfree() on an uninitialized pointer.
    
    Finally, remove the kfree() for the xattr name, as it is not allocated
    anymore.

    HID: wacom: Ensure bootloader PID is usable in hidraw mode
    
    commit 1db1f392591aff13fd643f0ec7c1d5e27391d700 upstream.
    
    Some Wacom devices have a special "bootloader" mode that is used for
    firmware flashing. When operating in this mode, the device cannot be
    used for input, and the HID descriptor is not able to be processed by
    the driver. The driver generates an "Unknown device_type" warning and
    then returns an error code from wacom_probe(). This is a problem because
    userspace still needs to be able to interact with the device via hidraw
    to perform the firmware flash.
    
    This commit adds a non-generic device definition for 056a:0094 which
    is used when devices are in "bootloader" mode. It marks the devices
    with a special BOOTLOADER type that is recognized by wacom_probe() and
    wacom_raw_event(). When we see this type we ensure a hidraw device is
    created and otherwise keep our hands off so that userspace is in full
    control.

    usb: dwc3: core: defer probe on ulpi_read_id timeout
    
    commit 63130462c919ece0ad0d9bb5a1f795ef8d79687e upstream.
    
    Since commit 0f0101719138 ("usb: dwc3: Don't switch OTG -> peripheral
    if extcon is present"), Dual Role support on Intel Merrifield platform
    broke due to rearranging the call to dwc3_get_extcon().
    
    It appears to be caused by ulpi_read_id() masking the timeout on the first
    test write. In the past dwc3 probe continued by calling dwc3_core_soft_reset()
    followed by dwc3_get_extcon() which happend to return -EPROBE_DEFER.
    On deferred probe ulpi_read_id() finally succeeded. Due to above mentioned
    rearranging -EPROBE_DEFER is not returned and probe completes without phy.
    
    On Intel Merrifield the timeout on the first test write issue is reproducible
    but it is difficult to find the root cause. Using a mainline kernel and
    rootfs with buildroot ulpi_read_id() succeeds. As soon as adding
    ftrace / bootconfig to find out why, ulpi_read_id() fails and we can't
    analyze the flow. Using another rootfs ulpi_read_id() fails even without
    adding ftrace. We suspect the issue is some kind of timing / race, but
    merely retrying ulpi_read_id() does not resolve the issue.
    
    As we now changed ulpi_read_id() to return -ETIMEDOUT in this case, we
    need to handle the error by calling dwc3_core_soft_reset() and request
    -EPROBE_DEFER. On deferred probe ulpi_read_id() is retried and succeeds.

    pstore: Make sure CONFIG_PSTORE_PMSG selects CONFIG_RT_MUTEXES
    
    [ Upstream commit 2f4fec5943407318b9523f01ce1f5d668c028332 ]
    
    In commit 76d62f24db07 ("pstore: Switch pmsg_lock to an rt_mutex
    to avoid priority inversion") I changed a lock to an rt_mutex.
    
    However, its possible that CONFIG_RT_MUTEXES is not enabled,
    which then results in a build failure, as the 0day bot detected:
      https://lore.kernel.org/linux-mm/202212211244.TwzWZD3H-lkp@intel.com/
    
    Thus this patch changes CONFIG_PSTORE_PMSG to select
    CONFIG_RT_MUTEXES, which ensures the build will not fail.

    [ Upstream commit 76d62f24db07f22ccf9bc18ca793c27d4ebef721 ]
    
    Wei Wang reported seeing priority inversion caused latencies
    caused by contention on pmsg_lock, and suggested it be switched
    to a rt_mutex.
    
    I was initially hesitant this would help, as the tasks in that
    trace all seemed to be SCHED_NORMAL, so the benefit would be
    limited to only nice boosting.
    
    However, another similar issue was raised where the priority
    inversion was seen did involve a blocked RT task so it is clear
    this would be helpful in that case.

    drm/sti: Fix return type of sti_{dvo,hda,hdmi}_connector_mode_valid()
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ad811cc08a937d875cbad0149c1bab17f84ba05 ]
    
    With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
    indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
    pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
    ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
    which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed. A
    proposed warning in clang aims to catch these at compile time, which
    reveals:

    media: si470x: Fix use-after-free in si470x_int_in_callback()
    
    [ Upstream commit 7d21e0b1b41b21d628bf2afce777727bd4479aa5 ]
    
    syzbot reported use-after-free in si470x_int_in_callback() [1].  This
    indicates that urb->context, which contains struct si470x_device
    object, is freed when si470x_int_in_callback() is called.
    
    The cause of this issue is that si470x_int_in_callback() is called for
    freed urb.
    
    si470x_usb_driver_probe() calls si470x_start_usb(), which then calls
    usb_submit_urb() and si470x_start().  If si470x_start_usb() fails,
    si470x_usb_driver_probe() doesn't kill urb, but it just frees struct
    si470x_device object, as depicted below:
    
    si470x_usb_driver_probe()
      ...
      si470x_start_usb()
        ...
        usb_submit_urb()
        retval = si470x_start()
        return retval
      if (retval < 0)
        free struct si470x_device object, but don't kill urb
    
    This patch fixes this issue by killing urb when si470x_start_usb()
    fails and urb is submitted.  If si470x_start_usb() fails and urb is
    not submitted, i.e. submitting usb fails, it just frees struct
    si470x_device object.

    media: dvb-usb: fix memory leak in dvb_usb_adapter_init()
    
    [ Upstream commit 94d90fb06b94a90c176270d38861bcba34ce377d ]
    
    Syzbot reports a memory leak in "dvb_usb_adapter_init()".
    The leak is due to not accounting for and freeing current iteration's
    adapter->priv in case of an error. Currently if an error occurs,
    it will exit before incrementing "num_adapters_initalized",
    which is used as a reference counter to free all adap->priv
    in "dvb_usb_adapter_exit()". There are multiple error paths that
    can exit from before incrementing the counter. Including the
    error handling paths for "dvb_usb_adapter_stream_init()",
    "dvb_usb_adapter_dvb_init()" and "dvb_usb_adapter_frontend_init()"
    within "dvb_usb_adapter_init()".
    
    This means that in case of an error in any of these functions the
    current iteration is not accounted for and the current iteration's
    adap->priv is not freed.
    
    Fix this by freeing the current iteration's adap->priv in the
    "stream_init_err:" label in the error path. The rest of the
    (accounted for) adap->priv objects are freed in dvb_usb_adapter_exit()
    as expected using the num_adapters_initalized variable.
    
    Syzbot report:

    media: dvbdev: adopts refcnt to avoid UAF
    
    [ Upstream commit 0fc044b2b5e2d05a1fa1fb0d7f270367a7855d79 ]
    
    dvb_unregister_device() is known that prone to use-after-free.
    That is, the cleanup from dvb_unregister_device() releases the dvb_device
    even if there are pointers stored in file->private_data still refer to it.
    
    This patch adds a reference counter into struct dvb_device and delays its
    deallocation until no pointer refers to the object.

    drm/sti: Use drm_mode_copy()
    
    [ Upstream commit 442cf8e22ba25a77cb9092d78733fdbac9844e50 ]
    
    struct drm_display_mode embeds a list head, so overwriting
    the full struct with another one will corrupt the list
    (if the destination mode is on a list). Use drm_mode_copy()
    instead which explicitly preserves the list head of
    the destination mode.
    
    Even if we know the destination mode is not on any list
    using drm_mode_copy() seems decent as it sets a good
    example. Bad examples of not using it might eventually
    get copied into code where preserving the list head
    actually matters.
    
    Obviously one case not covered here is when the mode
    itself is embedded in a larger structure and the whole
    structure is copied. But if we are careful when copying
    into modes embedded in structures I think we can be a
    little more reassured that bogus list heads haven't been
    propagated in.

    s390/ctcm: Fix return type of ctc{mp,}m_tx()
    
    [ Upstream commit aa5bf80c3c067b82b4362cd6e8e2194623bcaca6 ]
    
    With clang's kernel control flow integrity (kCFI, CONFIG_CFI_CLANG),
    indirect call targets are validated against the expected function
    pointer prototype to make sure the call target is valid to help mitigate
    ROP attacks. If they are not identical, there is a failure at run time,
    which manifests as either a kernel panic or thread getting killed. A
    proposed warning in clang aims to catch these at compile time, which
    reveals:
    
      drivers/s390/net/ctcm_main.c:1064:21: error: incompatible function pointer types initializing 'netdev_tx_t (*)(struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)' (aka 'enum netdev_tx (*)(struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)') with an expression of type 'int (struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *)' [-Werror,-Wincompatible-function-pointer-types-strict]
              .ndo_start_xmit         = ctcm_tx,
                                        ^~~~~~~

    ->ndo_start_xmit() in 'struct net_device_ops' expects a return type of
    'netdev_tx_t', not 'int'. Adjust the return type of ctc{mp,}m_tx() to
    match the prototype's to resolve the warning and potential CFI failure,
    should s390 select ARCH_SUPPORTS_CFI_CLANG in the future.
    
    Additionally, while in the area, remove a comment block that is no
    longer relevant.

    igb: Do not free q_vector unless new one was allocated
    
    [ Upstream commit 0668716506ca66f90d395f36ccdaebc3e0e84801 ]
    
    Avoid potential use-after-free condition under memory pressure. If the
    kzalloc() fails, q_vector will be freed but left in the original
    adapter->q_vector[v_idx] array position.

    wifi: brcmfmac: Fix potential shift-out-of-bounds in brcmf_fw_alloc_request()
    
    [ Upstream commit 81d17f6f3331f03c8eafdacea68ab773426c1e3c ]
    
    This patch fixes a shift-out-of-bounds in brcmfmac that occurs in
    BIT(chiprev) when a 'chiprev' provided by the device is too large.
    It should also not be equal to or greater than BITS_PER_TYPE(u32)
    as we do bitwise AND with a u32 variable and BIT(chiprev). The patch
    adds a check that makes the function return NULL if that is the case.
    Note that the NULL case is later handled by the bus-specific caller,
    brcmf_usb_probe_cb() or brcmf_usb_reset_resume(), for example.
    
    Found by a modified version of syzkaller.

    The reproducer doesn't really reproduce outside of syzkaller
    environment, so I'm taking a guess here. It looks like we
    do generate correct ETH_HLEN-sized packet, but we redirect
    the packet to the tunneling device. Before we do so, we
    __skb_pull l2 header and arrive again at skb->len == 0.
    Doesn't seem like we can do anything better than having
    an explicit check after __skb_pull?

    ipmi: fix memleak when unload ipmi driver
    
    [ Upstream commit 36992eb6b9b83f7f9cdc8e74fb5799d7b52e83e9 ]
    
    After the IPMI disconnect problem, the memory kept rising and we tried
    to unload the driver to free the memory. However, only part of the
    free memory is recovered after the driver is uninstalled. Using
    ebpf to hook free functions, we find that neither ipmi_user nor
    ipmi_smi_msg is free, only ipmi_recv_msg is free.
    
    We find that the deliver_smi_err_response call in clean_smi_msgs does
    the destroy processing on each message from the xmit_msg queue without
    checking the return value and free ipmi_smi_msg.
    
    deliver_smi_err_response is called only at this location. Adding the
    free handling has no effect.
    
    To verify, try using ebpf to trace the free function.
    
      $ bpftrace -e 'kretprobe:ipmi_alloc_recv_msg {printf("alloc rcv
          %p\n",retval);} kprobe:free_recv_msg {printf("free recv %p\n",

    In ar5523_probe(), ar5523_host_available() calls ar5523_cmd() as below
    (there are other functions which finally call ar5523_cmd()):
    
    ar5523_probe()
    -> ar5523_host_available()
       -> ar5523_cmd_read()
          -> ar5523_cmd()
    
    If ar5523_cmd() timed out, then ar5523_host_available() failed and
    ar5523_probe() freed the device structure.  So, ar5523_cmd_tx_cb()
    might touch the freed structure.
    
    This patch fixes this issue by canceling in-flight tx cmd if submitted
    urb timed out.

    wifi: ath9k: verify the expected usb_endpoints are present
    
    [ Upstream commit 16ef02bad239f11f322df8425d302be62f0443ce ]
    
    The bug arises when a USB device claims to be an ATH9K but doesn't
    have the expected endpoints. (In this case there was an interrupt
    endpoint where the driver expected a bulk endpoint.) The kernel
    needs to be able to handle such devices without getting an internal error.

    acct: fix potential integer overflow in encode_comp_t()
    
    [ Upstream commit c5f31c655bcc01b6da53b836ac951c1556245305 ]
    
    The integer overflow is descripted with following codes:
      > 317 static comp_t encode_comp_t(u64 value)
      > 318 {
      > 319         int exp, rnd;
        ......
      > 341         exp <<= MANTSIZE;
      > 342         exp += value;
      > 343         return exp;
      > 344 }
    
    Currently comp_t is defined as type of '__u16', but the variable 'exp' is
    type of 'int', so overflow would happen when variable 'exp' in line 343 is
    greater than 65535.

    nilfs2: fix shift-out-of-bounds/overflow in nilfs_sb2_bad_offset()
    
    [ Upstream commit 610a2a3d7d8be3537458a378ec69396a76c385b6 ]
    
    Patch series "nilfs2: fix UBSAN shift-out-of-bounds warnings on mount
    time".
    
    The first patch fixes a bug reported by syzbot, and the second one fixes
    the remaining bug of the same kind.  Although they are triggered by the
    same super block data anomaly, I divided it into the above two because the
    details of the issues and how to fix it are different.
    
    Both are required to eliminate the shift-out-of-bounds issues at mount
    time.
    
    This patch (of 2):
    
    If the block size exponent information written in an on-disk superblock is
    corrupted, nilfs_sb2_bad_offset helper function can trigger
    shift-out-of-bounds warning followed by a kernel panic (if panic_on_warn
    is set):
    
     shift exponent 38983 is too large for 64-bit type 'unsigned long long'
     Call Trace:

      nilfs_mount+0x613/0x9b0 fs/nilfs2/super.c:1317
      ...
    
    In addition, since nilfs_sb2_bad_offset() performs multiplication without
    considering the upper bound, the computation may overflow if the disk
    layout parameters are not normal.
    
    This fixes these issues by inserting preliminary sanity checks for those
    parameters and by converting the comparison from one involving
    multiplication and left bit-shifting to one using division and right
    bit-shifting.

    ACPICA: Fix error code path in acpi_ds_call_control_method()
    
    [ Upstream commit 404ec60438add1afadaffaed34bb5fe4ddcadd40 ]
    
    A use-after-free in acpi_ps_parse_aml() after a failing invocaion of
    acpi_ds_call_control_method() is reported by KASAN [1] and code
    inspection reveals that next_walk_state pushed to the thread by
    acpi_ds_create_walk_state() is freed on errors, but it is not popped
    from the thread beforehand.  Thus acpi_ds_get_current_walk_state()
    called by acpi_ps_parse_aml() subsequently returns it as the new
    walk state which is incorrect.
    
    To address this, make acpi_ds_call_control_method() call
    acpi_ds_pop_walk_state() to pop next_walk_state from the thread before
    returning an error.

    The cause of the issue is that brelse() is called on both ofibh.sbh
    and ofibh.ebh by udf_find_entry() when it returns NULL.  However,
    brelse() is called by udf_rename(), too.  So, b_count on buffer_head
    becomes unbalanced.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by not calling brelse() by udf_rename()
    when udf_find_entry() returns NULL.

    fs: jfs: fix shift-out-of-bounds in dbAllocAG
    
    [ Upstream commit 898f706695682b9954f280d95e49fa86ffa55d08 ]
    
    Syzbot found a crash : UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in dbAllocAG. The
    underlying bug is the missing check of bmp->db_agl2size. The field can
    be greater than 64 and trigger the shift-out-of-bounds.
    
    Fix this bug by adding a check of bmp->db_agl2size in dbMount since this
    field is used in many following functions. The upper bound for this
    field is L2MAXL2SIZE - L2MAXAG, thanks for the help of Dave Kleikamp.
    Note that, for maintenance, I reorganized error handling code of dbMount.

    net: stream: purge sk_error_queue in sk_stream_kill_queues()
    
    [ Upstream commit e0c8bccd40fc1c19e1d246c39bcf79e357e1ada3 ]
    
    Changheon Lee reported TCP socket leaks, with a nice repro.
    
    It seems we leak TCP sockets with the following sequence:
    
    1) SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_ACK is enabled on the socket.
    
       Each ACK will cook an skb put in error queue, from __skb_tstamp_tx().
       __skb_tstamp_tx() is using skb_clone(), unless
       SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_TSONLY was also requested.
    
    2) If the application is also using MSG_ZEROCOPY, then we put in the
       error queue cloned skbs that had a struct ubuf_info attached to them.
    
       Whenever an struct ubuf_info is allocated, sock_zerocopy_alloc()
       does a sock_hold().
    
       As long as the cloned skbs are still in sk_error_queue,
       socket refcount is kept elevated.
    
    3) Application closes the socket, while error queue is not empty.
    
    Since tcp_close() no longer purges the socket error queue,
    we might end up with a TCP socket with at least one skb in
    error queue keeping the socket alive forever.
    
    This bug can be (ab)used to consume all kernel memory
    and freeze the host.
    
    We need to purge the error queue, with proper synchronization
    against concurrent writers.

    net_sched: reject TCF_EM_SIMPLE case for complex ematch module
    
    [ Upstream commit 9cd3fd2054c3b3055163accbf2f31a4426f10317 ]
    
    When TCF_EM_SIMPLE was introduced, it is supposed to be convenient
    for ematch implementation:
    
    https://lore.kernel.org/all/20050105110048.GO26856@postel.suug.ch/
    
    "You don't have to, providing a 32bit data chunk without TCF_EM_SIMPLE
    set will simply result in allocating & copy. It's an optimization,
    nothing more."
    
    So if an ematch module provides ops->datalen that means it wants a
    complex data structure (saved in its em->data) instead of a simple u32
    value. We should simply reject such a combination, otherwise this u32
    could be misinterpreted as a pointer.

    openvswitch: Fix flow lookup to use unmasked key
    
    [ Upstream commit 68bb10101e6b0a6bb44e9c908ef795fc4af99eae ]
    
    The commit mentioned below causes the ovs_flow_tbl_lookup() function
    to be called with the masked key. However, it's supposed to be called
    with the unmasked key. This due to the fact that the datapath supports
    installing wider flows, and OVS relies on this behavior. For example
    if ipv4(src=1.1.1.1/192.0.0.0, dst=1.1.1.2/192.0.0.0) exists, a wider
    flow (smaller mask) of ipv4(src=192.1.1.1/128.0.0.0,dst=192.1.1.2/
    128.0.0.0) is allowed to be added.
    
    However, if we try to add a wildcard rule, the installation fails:
    
    $ ovs-appctl dpctl/add-flow system@myDP "in_port(1),eth_type(0x0800), \
      ipv4(src=1.1.1.1/192.0.0.0,dst=1.1.1.2/192.0.0.0,frag=no)" 2
    $ ovs-appctl dpctl/add-flow system@myDP "in_port(1),eth_type(0x0800), \
      ipv4(src=192.1.1.1/0.0.0.0,dst=49.1.1.2/0.0.0.0,frag=no)" 2
    ovs-vswitchd: updating flow table (File exists)
    
    The reason is that the key used to determine if the flow is already
    present in the system uses the original key ANDed with the mask.
    This results in the IP address not being part of the (miniflow) key,
    i.e., being substituted with an all-zero value. When doing the actual
    lookup, this results in the key wrongfully matching the first flow,
    and therefore the flow does not get installed.
    
    This change reverses the commit below, but rather than having the key
    on the stack, it's allocated.

          ...
    
    The problem occurs in probe process as follows:
      r6040_init_one:
        mdiobus_register
          mdiobus_scan    <- alloc and register phy_device,
                             the reference count of phy_device is 3
        r6040_mii_probe
          phy_connect     <- connect to the first phy_device,
                             so the reference count of the first
                             phy_device is 4, others are 3
        register_netdev   <- fault inject succeeded, goto error handling path
    
        // error handling path
        err_out_mdio_unregister:
          mdiobus_unregister(lp->mii_bus);
        err_out_mdio:
          mdiobus_free(lp->mii_bus);    <- the reference count of the first
                                           phy_device is 1, it is not released
                                           and other phy_devices are released
      // similarly, the remove process also has the same problem
    
    The root cause is traced to the phy_device is not disconnected when
    removes one r6040 device in r6040_remove_one() or on error handling path
    after r6040_mii probed successfully. In r6040_mii_probe(), a net ethernet
    device is connected to the first PHY device of mii_bus, in order to
    notify the connected driver when the link status changes, which is the
    default behavior of the PHY infrastructure to handle everything.
    Therefore the phy_device should be disconnected when removes one r6040
    device or on error handling path.
    
    Fix it by adding phy_disconnect() when removes one r6040 device or on
    error handling path after r6040_mii probed successfully.

    mISDN: hfcmulti: don't call dev_kfree_skb/kfree_skb() under spin_lock_irqsave()
    
    [ Upstream commit 1232946cf522b8de9e398828bde325d7c41f29dd ]
    
    It is not allowed to call kfree_skb() or consume_skb() from hardware
    interrupt context or with hardware interrupts being disabled.
    
    skb_queue_purge() is called under spin_lock_irqsave() in handle_dmsg()
    and hfcm_l1callback(), kfree_skb() is called in them, to fix this, use
    skb_queue_splice_init() to move the dch->squeue to a free queue, also
    enqueue the tx_skb and rx_skb, at last calling __skb_queue_purge() to
    free the SKBs afer unlock.

    [ Upstream commit ddc9648db162eee556edd5222d2808fe33730203 ]
    
    It is not allowed to call kfree_skb() or consume_skb() from hardware
    interrupt context or with hardware interrupts being disabled.
    
    It should use dev_kfree_skb_irq() or dev_consume_skb_irq() instead.
    The difference between them is free reason, dev_kfree_skb_irq() means
    the SKB is dropped in error and dev_consume_skb_irq() means the SKB
    is consumed in normal.
    
    skb_queue_purge() is called under spin_lock_irqsave() in hfcusb_l2l1D(),

    a reference to the xprt otherwise both client cleanup and the
    error handling path of the caller call to put it. Better to

    macro to enable these events for platform firmware
    that supports counter_info_version 0x6 or below. And assigning

    powerpc/perf: callchain validate kernel stack pointer bounds
    
    [ Upstream commit 32c5209214bd8d4f8c4e9d9b630ef4c671f58e79 ]
    
    The interrupt frame detection and loads from the hypothetical pt_regs
    are not bounds-checked. The next-frame validation only bounds-checks
    STACK_FRAME_OVERHEAD, which does not include the pt_regs. Add another
    test for this.
    
    The user could set r1 to be equal to the address matching the first
    interrupt frame - STACK_INT_FRAME_SIZE, which is in the previous page
    due to the kernel redzone, and induce the kernel to load the marker from
    there. Possibly this could cause a crash at least. If the user could
    induce the previous page to contain a valid marker, then it might be
    able to direct perf to read specific memory addresses in a way that
    could be transmitted back to the user in the perf data.

    macintosh: fix possible memory leak in macio_add_one_device()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ca86eae55a2f006e6c1edd2029b2cacb6979515 ]
    
    Afer commit 1fa5ae857bb1 ("driver core: get rid of struct device's
    bus_id string array"), the name of device is allocated dynamically. It
    needs to be freed when of_device_register() fails. Call put_device() to
    give up the reference that's taken in device_initialize(), so that it
    can be freed in kobject_cleanup() when the refcount hits 0.

    As comment of pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot() says, it returns
    a pci device with refcount increment, when finish using it,
    the caller must decrement the reference count by calling
    pci_dev_put(). So call it before returning from ppr_notifier()
    to avoid refcount leak.

    rtc: snvs: Allow a time difference on clock register read
    
    [ Upstream commit 0462681e207ccc44778a77b3297af728b1cf5b9f ]
    
    On an iMX6ULL the following message appears when a wakealarm is set:
    
    echo 0 > /sys/class/rtc/rtc1/wakealarm
    rtc rtc1: Timeout trying to get valid LPSRT Counter read
    
    This does not always happen but is reproducible quite often (7 out of 10
    times). The problem appears because the iMX6ULL is not able to read the
    registers within one 32kHz clock cycle which is the base clock of the
    RTC. Therefore, this patch allows a difference of up to 320 cycles
    (10ms). 10ms was chosen to be big enough even on systems with less cpu
    power (e.g. iMX6ULL). According to the reference manual a difference is
    fine:
    - If the two consecutive reads are similar, the value is correct.
    The values have to be similar, not equal.

    include/uapi/linux/swab: Fix potentially missing __always_inline
    
    [ Upstream commit defbab270d45e32b068e7e73c3567232d745c60f ]
    
    Commit bc27fb68aaad ("include/uapi/linux/byteorder, swab: force inlining
    of some byteswap operations") added __always_inline to swab functions
    and commit 283d75737837 ("uapi/linux/stddef.h: Provide __always_inline to
    userspace headers") added a definition of __always_inline for use in
    exported headers when the kernel's compiler.h is not available.
    
    However, since swab.h does not include stddef.h, if the header soup does
    not indirectly include it, the definition of __always_inline is missing,
    resulting in a compilation failure, which was observed compiling the
    perf tool using exported headers containing this commit:
    
    In file included from /usr/include/linux/byteorder/little_endian.h:12:0,
                     from /usr/include/asm/byteorder.h:14,
                     from tools/include/uapi/linux/perf_event.h:20,
                     from perf.h:8,

     static __always_inline __u16 __swab16p(const __u16 *p)
    
    Fix this by replacing the inclusion of linux/compiler.h with
    linux/stddef.h to ensure that we pick up that definition if required,
    without relying on it's indirect inclusion. compiler.h is then included
    indirectly, via stddef.h.

    power: supply: fix residue sysfs file in error handle route of __power_supply_register()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5b79480ce1978864ac3f06f2134dfa3b6691fe74 ]
    
    If device_add() succeeds, we should call device_del() when want to

    serial: amba-pl011: avoid SBSA UART accessing DMACR register
    
    [ Upstream commit 94cdb9f33698478b0e7062586633c42c6158a786 ]
    
    Chapter "B Generic UART" in "ARM Server Base System Architecture" [1]
    documentation describes a generic UART interface. Such generic UART
    does not support DMA. In current code, sbsa_uart_pops and
    amba_pl011_pops share the same stop_rx operation, which will invoke
    pl011_dma_rx_stop, leading to an access of the DMACR register. This
    commit adds a using_rx_dma check in pl011_dma_rx_stop to avoid the
    access to DMACR register for SBSA UARTs which does not support DMA.
    
    When the kernel enables DMA engine with "CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE=y", Linux
    SBSA PL011 driver will access PL011 DMACR register in some functions.
    For most real SBSA Pl011 hardware implementations, the DMACR write
    behaviour will be ignored. So these DMACR operations will not cause
    obvious problems. But for some virtual SBSA PL011 hardware, like Xen
    virtual SBSA PL011 (vpl011) device, the behaviour might be different.
    Xen vpl011 emulation will inject a data abort to guest, when guest is
    accessing an unimplemented UART register. As Xen VPL011 is SBSA
    compatible, it will not implement DMACR register. So when Linux SBSA
    PL011 driver access DMACR register, it will get an unhandled data abort
    fault and the application will get a segmentation fault:

    usb: fotg210-udc: Fix ages old endianness issues
    
    [ Upstream commit 46ed6026ca2181c917c8334a82e3eaf40a6234dd ]
    
    The code in the FOTG210 driver isn't entirely endianness-agnostic
    as reported by the kernel robot sparse testing. This came to
    the surface while moving the files around.
    
    The driver is only used on little-endian systems, so this causes
    no real-world regression, but it is nice to be strict and have
    some compile coverage also on big endian machines, so fix it
    up with the right LE accessors.

    uio: uio_dmem_genirq: Fix deadlock between irq config and handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 118b918018175d9fcd8db667f905012e986cc2c9 ]
    
    This fixes a concurrency issue addressed in commit 34cb27528398 ("UIO: Fix
    concurrency issue"):
    
      "In a SMP case there was a race condition issue between
      Uio_pdrv_genirq_irqcontrol() running on one CPU and irq handler on
      another CPU. Fix it by spin_locking shared resources access inside irq
      handler."
    
    The implementation of "uio_dmem_genirq" was based on "uio_pdrv_genirq" and
    it is used in a similar manner to the "uio_pdrv_genirq" driver with respect
    to interrupt configuration and handling. At the time "uio_dmem_genirq" was
    merged, both had the same implementation of the 'uio_info' handlers
    irqcontrol() and handler(), thus, both had the same concurrency issue
    mentioned by the above commit. However, the above patch was only applied to
    the "uio_pdrv_genirq" driver.
    
    Split out from commit 34cb27528398 ("UIO: Fix concurrency issue").

    Commit b74351287d4b ("uio: fix a sleep-in-atomic-context bug in
    uio_dmem_genirq_irqcontrol()") started calling disable_irq() without
    holding the spinlock because it can sleep. However, that fix introduced
    another bug: if interrupt is already disabled and a new disable request
    comes in, then the spinlock is not unlocked:

    ('myfpga' is a simple 'uio_dmem_genirq' driver I wrote to test this)
    
    The implementation of "uio_dmem_genirq" was based on "uio_pdrv_genirq" and
    it is used in a similar manner to the "uio_pdrv_genirq" driver with respect
    to interrupt configuration and handling. At the time "uio_dmem_genirq" was
    introduced, both had the same implementation of the 'uio_info' handlers
    irqcontrol() and handler(). Then commit 34cb27528398 ("UIO: Fix concurrency
    issue"), which was only applied to "uio_pdrv_genirq", ended up making them
    a little different. That commit, among other things, changed disable_irq()
    to disable_irq_nosync() in the implementation of irqcontrol(). The
    motivation there was to avoid a deadlock between irqcontrol() and
    handler(), since it added a spinlock in the irq handler, and disable_irq()
    waits for the completion of the irq handler.
    
    By changing disable_irq() to disable_irq_nosync() in irqcontrol(), we also
    avoid the sleeping-while-atomic bug that commit b74351287d4b ("uio: fix a
    sleep-in-atomic-context bug in uio_dmem_genirq_irqcontrol()") was trying to
    fix. Thus, this fixes the missing unlock in irqcontrol() by importing the
    implementation of irqcontrol() handler from the "uio_pdrv_genirq" driver.
    In the end, it reverts commit b74351287d4b ("uio: fix a
    sleep-in-atomic-context bug in uio_dmem_genirq_irqcontrol()") and change
    disable_irq() to disable_irq_nosync().
    
    It is worth noting that this still does not address the concurrency issue
    fixed by commit 34cb27528398 ("UIO: Fix concurrency issue"). It will be
    addressed separately in the next commits.

    class: fix possible memory leak in __class_register()
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c3e8a6bdb5253b97ad532570f8b5db5f7a06407 ]
    
    If class_add_groups() returns error, the 'cp->subsys' need be
    unregister, and the 'cp' need be freed.
    
    We can not call kset_unregister() here, because the 'cls' will
    be freed in callback function class_release() and it's also
    freed in caller's error path, it will cause double free.
    
    So fix this by calling kobject_del() and kfree_const(name) to
    cleanup kobject. Besides, call kfree() to free the 'cp'.

    IB/IPoIB: Fix queue count inconsistency for PKEY child interfaces
    
    [ Upstream commit dbc94a0fb81771a38733c0e8f2ea8c4fa6934dc1 ]
    
    There are 2 ways to create IPoIB PKEY child interfaces:
    1) Writing a PKEY to /sys/class/net/<ib parent interface>/create_child.
    2) Using netlink with iproute.
    
    While with sysfs the child interface has the same number of tx and
    rx queues as the parent, with netlink there will always be 1 tx
    and 1 rx queue for the child interface. That's because the
    get_num_tx/rx_queues() netlink ops are missing and the default value
    of 1 is taken for the number of queues (in rtnl_create_link()).
    
    This change adds the get_num_tx/rx_queues() ops which allows for
    interfaces with multiple queues to be created over netlink. This
    constant only represents the max number of tx and rx queues on that
    net device.

    scsi: fcoe: Fix possible name leak when device_register() fails
    
    [ Upstream commit 47b6a122c7b69a876c7ee2fc064a26b09627de9d ]
    
    If device_register() returns an error, the name allocated by dev_set_name()
    needs to be freed. As the comment of device_register() says, one should use
    put_device() to give up the reference in the error path. Fix this by
    calling put_device(), then the name can be freed in kobject_cleanup().
    
    The 'fcf' is freed in fcoe_fcf_device_release(), so the kfree() in the
    error path can be removed.
    
    The 'ctlr' is freed in fcoe_ctlr_device_release(), so don't use the error
    label, just return NULL after calling put_device().

    stmmac: fix potential division by 0
    
    [ Upstream commit ede5a389852d3640a28e7187fb32b7f204380901 ]
    
    When the MAC is connected to a 10 Mb/s PHY and the PTP clock is derived
    from the MAC reference clock (default), the clk_ptp_rate becomes too
    small and the calculated sub second increment becomes 0 when computed by
    the stmmac_config_sub_second_increment() function within
    stmmac_init_tstamp_counter().
    
    Therefore, the subsequent div_u64 in stmmac_init_tstamp_counter()
    operation triggers a divide by 0 exception as shown below.

    ntb_netdev: Use dev_kfree_skb_any() in interrupt context
    
    [ Upstream commit 5f7d78b2b12a9d561f48fa00bab29b40f4616dad ]
    
    TX/RX callback handlers (ntb_netdev_tx_handler(),
    ntb_netdev_rx_handler()) can be called in interrupt
    context via the DMA framework when the respective
    DMA operations have completed. As such, any calls
    by these routines to free skb's, should use the
    interrupt context safe dev_kfree_skb_any() function.
    
    Previously, these callback handlers would call the
    interrupt unsafe version of dev_kfree_skb(). This has
    not presented an issue on Intel IOAT DMA engines as
    that driver utilizes tasklets rather than a hard
    interrupt handler, like the AMD PTDMA DMA driver.
    On AMD systems, a kernel WARNING message is
    encountered, which is being issued from
    skb_release_head_state() due to in_hardirq()
    being true.
    
    Besides the user visible WARNING from the kernel,
    the other symptom of this bug was that TCP/IP performance
    across the ntb_netdev interface was very poor, i.e.
    approximately an order of magnitude below what was
    expected. With the repair to use dev_kfree_skb_any(),
    kernel WARNINGs from skb_release_head_state() ceased
    and TCP/IP performance, as measured by iperf, was on
    par with expected results, approximately 20 Gb/s on
    AMD Milan based server. Note that this performance
    is comparable with Intel based servers.

    [ Upstream commit f8ab263d4d48e6dab752029bf562f20a2ee630ed ]
    
    There are cables that exist that can support speeds in excess of 10GbE.
    The driver, however, restricts the EEPROM advertised nominal bitrate to
    a specific range, which can prevent usage of cables that can support,
    for example, up to 25GbE.
    
    Rather than checking that an active or passive cable supports a specific
    range, only check for a minimum supported speed.

    Fix it by adding free_netdev() and kfree() in fst_remove_one(), just as
    the operations on the error handling path in fst_add_one().

    ethernet: s2io: don't call dev_kfree_skb() under spin_lock_irqsave()
    
    [ Upstream commit 6cee96e09df54ae17784c0f38a49e0ed8229b825 ]
    
    It is not allowed to call kfree_skb() or consume_skb() from hardware
    interrupt context or with hardware interrupts being disabled.
    
    It should use dev_kfree_skb_irq() or dev_consume_skb_irq() instead.
    The difference between them is free reason, dev_kfree_skb_irq() means
    the SKB is dropped in error and dev_consume_skb_irq() means the SKB
    is consumed in normal.
    
    In this case, dev_kfree_skb() is called in free_tx_buffers() to drop
    the SKBs in tx buffers, when the card is down, so replace it with
    dev_kfree_skb_irq() here.

    blktrace: Fix output non-blktrace event when blk_classic option enabled
    
    [ Upstream commit f596da3efaf4130ff61cd029558845808df9bf99 ]
    
    When the blk_classic option is enabled, non-blktrace events must be
    filtered out. Otherwise, events of other types are output in the blktrace
    classic format, which is unexpected.
    
    The problem can be triggered in the following ways:
    
      # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/options/blk_classic
      # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/enable

    [ Upstream commit 29276d56f6ed138db0f38cd31aedc0b725c8c76c ]
    
    mmc_add_host() may return error, if we ignore its return value, the memory
    that allocated in mmc_alloc_host() will be leaked and it will lead a kernel
    crash because of deleting not added device in the remove path.
    
    So fix this by checking the return value and goto error path which will call
    mmc_free_host(), besides, clk_disable_unprepare() also needs be called.

    I got a null-ptr-defer error report when I do the following tests
    on the qemu platform:
    
    make defconfig and CONFIG_PARPORT=m, CONFIG_PARPORT_PC=m,
    CONFIG_SND_MTS64=m

    If we're asked to recover open state while a delegation return is
    outstanding, then the state manager thread cannot use a cached open, so
    if the server returns a delegation, we can end up deadlocked behind the
    pending delegreturn.
    To avoid this problem, let's just ask the server not to give us a
    delegation unless we're explicitly reclaiming one.

    media: imon: fix a race condition in send_packet()
    
    [ Upstream commit 813ceef062b53d68f296aa3cb944b21a091fabdb ]
    
    The function send_packet() has a race condition as follows:
    
    func send_packet()
    {
        // do work
        call usb_submit_urb()
        mutex_unlock()
        wait_for_event_interruptible()  <-- lock gone
        mutex_lock()
    }
    
    func vfd_write()
    {
        mutex_lock()
        call send_packet()  <- prev call is not completed
        mutex_unlock()
    }
    
    When the mutex is unlocked and the function send_packet() waits for the
    call to complete, vfd_write() can start another call, which leads to the
    "URB submitted while active" warning in usb_submit_urb().
    Fix this by removing the mutex_unlock() call in send_packet() and using
    mutex_lock_interruptible().

    [ Upstream commit b434422c45282a0573d8123239abc41fa72665d4 ]
    
    A problem about modprobe s5p_fimc failed is triggered with the
    following log given:
    
     [  272.075275] Error: Driver 'exynos4-fimc' is already registered, aborting...
     modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 's5p_fimc': Device or resource busy
    
    The reason is that fimc_md_init() returns platform_driver_register()
    directly without checking its return value, if platform_driver_register()
    failed, it returns without unregister fimc_driver, resulting the
    s5p_fimc can never be installed later.
    A simple call graph is shown as below:
    
     fimc_md_init()
       fimc_register_driver() # register fimc_driver
       platform_driver_register()
         platform_driver_register()

             bus_add_driver()
               dev = kzalloc(...) # OOM happened
       # return without unregister fimc_driver
    
    Fix by unregister fimc_driver when platform_driver_register() returns

    Input: elants_i2c - properly handle the reset GPIO when power is off
    
    [ Upstream commit a85fbd6498441694475716a4d5c65f9d3e073faf ]
    
    As can be seen in elants_i2c_power_off(), we want the reset GPIO
    asserted when power is off. The reset GPIO is active low so we need
    the reset line logic low when power is off to avoid leakage.
    
    We have a problem, though, at probe time. At probe time we haven't
    powered the regulators on yet but we have:
    
      devm_gpiod_get(&client->dev, "reset", GPIOD_OUT_LOW);
    
    While that _looks_ right, it turns out that it's not. The
    GPIOD_OUT_LOW doesn't mean to init the GPIO to low. It means init the
    GPIO to "not asserted". Since this is an active low GPIO that inits it
    to be high.
    
    Let's fix this to properly init the GPIO. Now after both probe and
    power off the state of the GPIO is consistent (it's "asserted" or
    level low).
    
    Once we fix this, we can see that at power on time we no longer to
    assert the reset GPIO as the first thing. The reset GPIO is _always_
    asserted before powering on. Let's fix powering on to account for
    this.

    When the radeon driver reads the bios information from ACPI
    table in radeon_acpi_vfct_bios(), it misses to call acpi_put_table()
    to release the ACPI memory after the init, so add acpi_put_table()

    It is required to return the received buffers, if streaming can not be
    started. For instance media_pipeline_start() may fail with EPIPE, if
    a link validation between entities is not passed, and in such a case
    a user gets a kernel warning:

    [ Upstream commit dd95f2239fc846795fc926787c3ae0ca701c9840 ]
    
    It is possible that skb is freed in ath9k_htc_rx_msg(), then
    usb_submit_urb() fails and we try to free skb again. It causes
    use-after-free bug. Moreover, if alloc_skb() fails, urb->context becomes
    NULL but rx_buf is not freed and there can be a memory leak.
    
    The patch removes unnecessary nskb and makes skb processing more clear: it
    is supposed that ath9k_htc_rx_msg() either frees old skb or passes its
    managing to another callback function.

    wifi: ath9k: hif_usb: fix memory leak of urbs in ath9k_hif_usb_dealloc_tx_urbs()
    
    [ Upstream commit c2a94de38c74e86f49124ac14f093d6a5c377a90 ]
    
    Syzkaller reports a long-known leak of urbs in
    ath9k_hif_usb_dealloc_tx_urbs().
    
    The cause of the leak is that usb_get_urb() is called but usb_free_urb()
    (or usb_put_urb()) is not called inside usb_kill_urb() as urb->dev or
    urb->ep fields have not been initialized and usb_kill_urb() returns
    immediately.
    
    The patch removes trying to kill urbs located in hif_dev->tx.tx_buf
    because hif_dev->tx.tx_buf is not supposed to contain urbs which are in
    pending state (the pending urbs are stored in hif_dev->tx.tx_pending).
    The tx.tx_lock is acquired so there should not be any changes in the list.

    [ Upstream commit 470188b09e92d83c5a997f25f0e8fb8cd2bc3469 ]

    The root cause of the problem is that the acpi_operand_object
    is freed when acpi_ut_walk_package_tree() fails in
    acpi_ut_copy_ipackage_to_ipackage(), lead to repeated release in
    acpi_ut_copy_iobject_to_iobject(). The problem was introduced
    by "8aa5e56eeb61" commit, this commit is to fix memory leak in
    acpi_ut_copy_iobject_to_iobject(), repeatedly adding remove
    operation, lead to "acpi_operand_object" used after free.
    
    Fix it by removing acpi_ut_remove_reference() in
    acpi_ut_copy_ipackage_to_ipackage(). acpi_ut_copy_ipackage_to_ipackage()
    is called to copy an internal package object into another internal
    package object, when it fails, the memory of acpi_operand_object
    should be freed by the caller.

    When `timerqueue_getnext()` is called on an empty timer queue, it will
    use `rb_entry()` on a NULL pointer, which is invalid. Fix that by using
    `rb_entry_safe()` which handles NULL pointers.
    
    This has not caused any issues so far because the offset of the `rb_node`
    member in `timerqueue_node` is 0, so `rb_entry()` is essentially a no-op.

    perf: Fix possible memleak in pmu_dev_alloc()
    
    [ Upstream commit e8d7a90c08ce963c592fb49845f2ccc606a2ac21 ]
    
    In pmu_dev_alloc(), when dev_set_name() failed, it will goto free_dev
    and call put_device(pmu->dev) to release it.
    However pmu->dev->release is assigned after this, which makes warning
    and memleak.
    Call dev_set_name() after pmu->dev->release = pmu_dev_release to fix it.

    fs: don't audit the capability check in simple_xattr_list()
    
    [ Upstream commit e7eda157c4071cd1e69f4b1687b0fbe1ae5e6f46 ]
    
    The check being unconditional may lead to unwanted denials reported by
    LSMs when a process has the capability granted by DAC, but denied by an
    LSM. In the case of SELinux such denials are a problem, since they can't
    be effectively filtered out via the policy and when not silenced, they
    produce noise that may hide a true problem or an attack.
    
    Checking for the capability only if any trusted xattr is actually
    present wouldn't really address the issue, since calling listxattr(2) on
    such node on its own doesn't indicate an explicit attempt to see the
    trusted xattrs. Additionally, it could potentially leak the presence of
    trusted xattrs to an unprivileged user if they can check for the denials
    (e.g. through dmesg).
    
    Therefore, it's best (and simplest) to keep the check unconditional and
    instead use ns_capable_noaudit() that will silence any associated LSM
    denials.

    cpuidle: dt: Return the correct numbers of parsed idle states
    
    [ Upstream commit ee3c2c8ad6ba6785f14a60e4081d7c82e88162a2 ]
    
    While we correctly skips to initialize an idle state from a disabled idle
    state node in DT, the returned value from dt_init_idle_driver() don't get
    adjusted accordingly. Instead the number of found idle state nodes are
    returned, while the callers are expecting the number of successfully
    initialized idle states from DT.
    
    This leads to cpuidle drivers unnecessarily continues to initialize their
    idle state specific data. Moreover, in the case when all idle states have
    been disabled in DT, we would end up registering a cpuidle driver, rather
    than relying on the default arch specific idle call.

    During early boot, memblock reserves the pages for the ramoops reserved
    memory node in DT that would otherwise be part of the direct lowmem
    mapping. Pstore's ram backend reuses those reserved pages to change the
    memory type (writeback or non-cached) by passing the pages to vmap()
    (see pfn_to_page() usage in persistent_ram_vmap() for more details) with
    specific flags. When read_kcore() starts iterating over the vmalloc
    region, it runs over the virtual address that vmap() returned for
    ramoops. In aligned_vread() the virtual address is passed to
    vmalloc_to_page() which returns the page struct for the reserved lowmem
    area. That lowmem page is passed to kmap_atomic(), which effectively
    calls page_to_virt() that assumes a lowmem page struct must be directly
    accessible with __va() and friends. These pages are mapped via vmap()
    though, and the lowmem mapping was never made, so accessing them via the
    lowmem virtual address oopses like above.
    
    Let's side-step this problem by passing VM_IOREMAP to vmap(). This will
    tell vread() to not include the ramoops region in the kcore. Instead the
    area will look like a bunch of zeros. The alternative is to teach kmap()
    about vmalloc areas that intersect with lowmem. Presumably such a change
    isn't a one-liner, and there isn't much interest in inspecting the
    ramoops region in kcore files anyway, so the most expedient route is
    taken for now.

    timer_read() was using an empty 100-iteration loop to wait for the

    wasn't long enough. This resulted in CPU idle time being extremely
    underreported on PXA168 with CONFIG_NO_HZ_IDLE=y.

    capture delay by reading TMR_CVWR a few times instead.

    usb: musb: remove extra check in musb_gadget_vbus_draw
    
    [ Upstream commit ecec4b20d29c3d6922dafe7d2555254a454272d2 ]
    
    The checks for musb->xceiv and musb->xceiv->set_power duplicate those in
    usb_phy_set_power(), so there is no need of them. Moreover, not calling
    usb_phy_set_power() results in usb_phy_set_charger_current() not being
    called, so current USB config max current is not propagated through USB
    charger framework and charger drivers may try to draw more current than
    allowed or possible.
    
    Fix that by removing those extra checks and calling usb_phy_set_power()
    directly.
    
    Tested on Motorola Droid4 and Nokia N900

    [ Upstream commit 31d929de5a112ee1b977a89c57de74710894bbbf ]
    
    When the name_assign_type attribute was introduced (commit
    685343fc3ba6, "net: add name_assign_type netdev attribute"), the
    loopback device was explicitly mentioned as one which would make use
    of NET_NAME_PREDICTABLE:
    
        The name_assign_type attribute gives hints where the interface name of a
        given net-device comes from. These values are currently defined:
    ...
          NET_NAME_PREDICTABLE:
            The ifname has been assigned by the kernel in a predictable way
            that is guaranteed to avoid reuse and always be the same for a
            given device. Examples include statically created devices like
            the loopback device [...]
    
    Switch to that so that reading /sys/class/net/lo/name_assign_type
    produces something sensible instead of returning -EINVAL.

    By keep sending L2CAP_CONF_REQ packets, chan->num_conf_rsp increases
    multiple times and eventually it will wrap around the maximum number
    (i.e., 255).

    igb: Initialize mailbox message for VF reset
    
    commit de5dc44370fbd6b46bd7f1a1e00369be54a041c8 upstream.
    
    When a MAC address is not assigned to the VF, that portion of the message
    sent to the VF is not set. The memory, however, is allocated from the
    stack meaning that information may be leaked to the VM. Initialize the
    message buffer to 0 so that no information is passed to the VM in this
    case.

    commit e88906b169ebcb8046e8f0ad76edd09ab41cfdfe upstream.
    
    The RF sniffers are based on cp210x where the RF frontends
    are based on a different USB stack.
    
    RF sniffers can analyze packets meta data including power level
    and perform packet injection.

    usb: gadget: uvc: Prevent buffer overflow in setup handler
    
    commit 4c92670b16727365699fe4b19ed32013bab2c107 upstream.
    
    Setup function uvc_function_setup permits control transfer
    requests with up to 64 bytes of payload (UVC_MAX_REQUEST_SIZE),
    data stage handler for OUT transfer uses memcpy to copy req->actual
    bytes to uvc_event->data.data array of size 60. This may result
    in an overflow of 4 bytes.

    udf: Fix extending file within last block
    
    commit 1f3868f06855c97a4954c99b36f3fc9eb8f60326 upstream.
    
    When extending file within last block it can happen that the extent is
    already rounded to the blocksize and thus contains the offset we want to
    grow up to. In such case we would mistakenly expand the last extent and
    make it one block longer than it should be, exposing unallocated block
    in a file and causing data corruption. Fix the problem by properly
    detecting this case and bailing out.

    commit 16d0556568148bdcaa45d077cac9f8f7077cf70a upstream.
    
    When extending file with a hole, we tried to preserve existing
    preallocation for the file. However that is not very useful and
    complicates code because the previous extent may need to be rounded to
    block boundary as well (which we forgot to do thus causing data
    corruption for sequence like:
    
    xfs_io -f -c "pwrite 0x75e63 11008" -c "truncate 0x7b24b" \
      -c "truncate 0xabaa3" -c "pwrite 0xac70b 22954" \
      -c "pwrite 0x93a43 11358" -c "pwrite 0xb8e65 52211" file
    
    with 512-byte block size. Just discard preallocation before extending
    file to simplify things and also fix this data corruption.

    can: mcba_usb: Fix termination command argument
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a8e3bd25f1e789c8154e11ea24dc3ec5a4c1da0 ]
    
    Microchip USB Analyzer can activate the internal termination resistors
    by setting the "termination" option ON, or OFF to to deactivate them.
    As I've observed, both with my oscilloscope and captured USB packets
    below, you must send "0" to turn it ON, and "1" to turn it OFF.
    
    From the schematics in the user's guide, I can confirm that you must
    drive the CAN_RES signal LOW "0" to activate the resistors.
    
    Reverse the argument value of usb_msg.termination to fix this.
    
    These are the two commands sequence, ON then OFF.

    nfp: fix use-after-free in area_cache_get()
    
    commit 02e1a114fdb71e59ee6770294166c30d437bf86a upstream.
    
    area_cache_get() is used to distribute cache->area and set cache->id,
     and if cache->id is not 0 and cache->area->kref refcount is 0, it will
     release the cache->area by nfp_cpp_area_release(). area_cache_get()
     set cache->id before cpp->op->area_init() and nfp_cpp_area_acquire().
    
    But if area_init() or nfp_cpp_area_acquire() fails, the cache->id is
     is already set but the refcount is not increased as expected. At this
     time, calling the nfp_cpp_area_release() will cause use-after-free.
    
    To avoid the use-after-free, set cache->id after area_init() and
     nfp_cpp_area_acquire() complete successfully.
    
    Note: This vulnerability is triggerable by providing emulated device
     equipped with specified configuration.

    block: unhash blkdev part inode when the part is deleted
    
    v5.11 changes the blkdev lookup mechanism completely since commit
    22ae8ce8b892 ("block: simplify bdev/disk lookup in blkdev_get"),
    and small part of the change is to unhash part bdev inode when
    deleting partition. Turns out this kind of change does fix one
    nasty issue in case of BLOCK_EXT_MAJOR:
    
    1) when one partition is deleted & closed, disk_put_part() is always
    called before bdput(bdev), see blkdev_put(); so the part's devt can
    be freed & re-used before the inode is dropped
    
    2) then new partition with same devt can be created just before the
    inode in 1) is dropped, then the old inode/bdev structurein 1) is
    re-used for this new partition, this way causes use-after-free and
    kernel panic.
    
    It isn't possible to backport the whole big patchset of "merge struct
    block_device and struct hd_struct v4" for addressing this issue.
    
    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20201128161510.347752-1-hch@lst.de/
    
    So fixes it by unhashing part bdev in delete_partition(), and this way
    is actually aligned with v5.11+'s behavior.
    
    Backported from the following 5.10.y commit:

    mm/khugepaged: invoke MMU notifiers in shmem/file collapse paths
    
    commit f268f6cf875f3220afc77bdd0bf1bb136eb54db9 upstream.
    
    Any codepath that zaps page table entries must invoke MMU notifiers to
    ensure that secondary MMUs (like KVM) don't keep accessing pages which
    aren't mapped anymore.  Secondary MMUs don't hold their own references to
    pages that are mirrored over, so failing to notify them can lead to page
    use-after-free.
    
    I'm marking this as addressing an issue introduced in commit f3f0e1d2150b
    ("khugepaged: add support of collapse for tmpfs/shmem pages"), but most of
    the security impact of this only came in commit 27e1f8273113 ("khugepaged:
    enable collapse pmd for pte-mapped THP"), which actually omitted flushes
    for the removal of present PTEs, not just for the removal of empty page
    tables.

    Since commit 70cbc3cc78a99 ("mm: gup: fix the fast GUP race against THP
    collapse"), the lockless_pages_from_mm() fastpath rechecks the pmd_t to
    ensure that the page table was not removed by khugepaged in between.
    
    However, lockless_pages_from_mm() still requires that the page table is
    not concurrently freed.  Fix it by sending IPIs (if the architecture uses
    semi-RCU-style page table freeing) before freeing/reusing page tables.

    once: add DO_ONCE_SLOW() for sleepable contexts
    
    commit 62c07983bef9d3e78e71189441e1a470f0d1e653 upstream.
    
    Christophe Leroy reported a ~80ms latency spike
    happening at first TCP connect() time.
    
    This is because __inet_hash_connect() uses get_random_once()
    to populate a perturbation table which became quite big
    after commit 4c2c8f03a5ab ("tcp: increase source port perturb table to 2^16")
    
    get_random_once() uses DO_ONCE(), which block hard irqs for the duration
    of the operation.
    
    This patch adds DO_ONCE_SLOW() which uses a mutex instead of a spinlock
    for operations where we prefer to stay in process context.
    
    Then __inet_hash_connect() can use get_random_slow_once()
    to populate its perturbation table.
    
    Fixes: 4c2c8f03a5ab ("tcp: increase source port perturb table to 2^16")
    Fixes: 190cc82489f4 ("tcp: change source port randomizarion at connect() time")

    libtraceevent: Fix build with binutils 2.35
    
    commit 39efdd94e314336f4acbac4c07e0f37bdc3bef71 upstream.
    
    In binutils 2.35, 'nm -D' changed to show symbol versions along with
    symbol names, with the usual @@ separator.  When generating
    libtraceevent-dynamic-list we need just the names, so strip off the
    version suffix if present.
