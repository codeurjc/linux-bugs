    nubus: Partially revert proc_create_single_data() conversion
    
    commit 0e96647cff9224db564a1cee6efccb13dbe11ee2 upstream.
    
    The conversion to proc_create_single_data() introduced a regression
    whereby reading a file in /proc/bus/nubus results in a seg fault:
    
        # grep -r . /proc/bus/nubus/e/
        Data read fault at 0x00000020 in Super Data (pc=0x1074c2)

    scripts/tags.sh: Resolve gtags empty index generation
    
    commit e1b37563caffc410bb4b55f153ccb14dede66815 upstream.
    
    gtags considers any file outside of its current working directory
    "outside the source tree" and refuses to index it. For O= kernel builds,
    or when "make" is invoked from a directory other then the kernel source
    tree, gtags ignores the entire kernel source and generates an empty
    index.
    
    Force-set gtags current working directory to the kernel source tree.
    
    Due to commit 9da0763bdd82 ("kbuild: Use relative path when building in
    a subdir of the source tree"), if the kernel build is done in a
    sub-directory of the kernel source tree, the kernel Makefile will set
    the kernel's $srctree to ".." for shorter compile-time and run-time
    warnings. Consequently, the list of files to be indexed will be in the
    "../*" form, rendering all such paths invalid once gtags switches to the
    kernel source tree as its current working directory.
    
    If gtags indexing is requested and the build directory is not the kernel
    source tree, index all files in absolute-path form.
    
    Note, indexing in absolute-path form will not affect the generated
    index, as paths in gtags indices are always relative to the gtags "root
    directory" anyway (as evidenced by "gtags --dump").

    perf symbols: Symbol lookup with kcore can fail if multiple segments match stext
    
    commit 1c249565426e3a9940102c0ba9f63914f7cda73d upstream.
    
    This problem was encountered on an arm64 system with a lot of memory.
    Without kernel debug symbols installed, and with both kcore and kallsyms
    available, perf managed to get confused and returned "unknown" for all
    of the kernel symbols that it tried to look up.
    
    On this system, stext fell within the vmalloc segment.  The kcore symbol
    matching code tries to find the first segment that contains stext and
    uses that to replace the segment generated from just the kallsyms
    information.  In this case, however, there were two: a very large
    vmalloc segment, and the text segment.  This caused perf to get confused
    because multiple overlapping segments were inserted into the RB tree
    that holds the discovered segments.  However, that alone wasn't
    sufficient to cause the problem. Even when we could find the segment,
    the offsets were adjusted in such a way that the newly generated symbols
    didn't line up with the instruction addresses in the trace.  The most
    obvious solution would be to consult which segment type is text from
    kcore, but this information is not exposed to users.
    
    Instead, select the smallest matching segment that contains stext
    instead of the first matching segment.  This allows us to match the text
    segment instead of vmalloc, if one is contained within the other.

    HID: wacom: Use ktime_t rather than int when dealing with timestamps
    
    commit 9a6c0e28e215535b2938c61ded54603b4e5814c5 upstream.
    
    Code which interacts with timestamps needs to use the ktime_t type
    returned by functions like ktime_get. The int type does not offer
    enough space to store these values, and attempting to use it is a
    recipe for problems. In this particular case, overflows would occur
    when calculating/storing timestamps leading to incorrect values being
    reported to userspace. In some cases these bad timestamps cause input
    handling in userspace to appear hung.

    bpf: ensure main program has an extable
    
    commit 0108a4e9f3584a7a2c026d1601b0682ff7335d95 upstream.
    
    When subprograms are in use, the main program is not jit'd after the
    subprograms because jit_subprogs sets a value for prog->bpf_func upon
    success.  Subsequent calls to the JIT are bypassed when this value is
    non-NULL.  This leads to a situation where the main program and its
    func[0] counterpart are both in the bpf kallsyms tree, but only func[0]
    has an extable.  Extables are only created during JIT.  Now there are
    two nearly identical program ksym entries in the tree, but only one has
    an extable.  Depending upon how the entries are placed, there's a chance
    that a fault will call search_extable on the aux with the NULL entry.
    
    Since jit_subprogs already copies state from func[0] to the main
    program, include the extable pointer in this state duplication.
    Additionally, ensure that the copy of the main program in func[0] is not
    added to the bpf_prog_kallsyms table. Instead, let the main program get
    added later in bpf_prog_load().  This ensures there is only a single
    copy of the main program in the kallsyms table, and that its tag matches
    the tag observed by tooling like bpftool.

    But the way the error value has been read and sent to the user space
    does not follow the common scheme to clear the error after reading
    which is provided by the sock_error() function. This leads to an error
    report at the following write() attempt although everything should be
    working.

    x86/smp: Use dedicated cache-line for mwait_play_dead()
    
    commit f9c9987bf52f4e42e940ae217333ebb5a4c3b506 upstream.
    
    Monitoring idletask::thread_info::flags in mwait_play_dead() has been an
    obvious choice as all what is needed is a cache line which is not written
    by other CPUs.
    
    But there is a use case where a "dead" CPU needs to be brought out of
    MWAIT: kexec().
    
    This is required as kexec() can overwrite text, pagetables, stacks and the
    monitored cacheline of the original kernel. The latter causes MWAIT to
    resume execution which obviously causes havoc on the kexec kernel which
    results usually in triple faults.
    
    Use a dedicated per CPU storage to prepare for that.

    mm, hwpoison: when copy-on-write hits poison, take page offline
    
    From: Tony Luck <tony.luck@intel.com>
    
    commit d302c2398ba269e788a4f37ae57c07a7fcabaa42 upstream.
    
    Cannot call memory_failure() directly from the fault handler because
    mmap_lock (and others) are held.
    
    It is important, but not urgent, to mark the source page as h/w poisoned
    and unmap it from other tasks.
    
    Use memory_failure_queue() to request a call to memory_failure() for the
    page with the error.
    
    Also provide a stub version for CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE=n

    mm, hwpoison: try to recover from copy-on write faults
    
    commit a873dfe1032a132bf89f9e19a6ac44f5a0b78754 upstream.
    
    Patch series "Copy-on-write poison recovery", v3.
    
    Part 1 deals with the process that triggered the copy on write fault with
    a store to a shared read-only page.  That process is send a SIGBUS with
    the usual machine check decoration to specify the virtual address of the
    lost page, together with the scope.
    
    Part 2 sets up to asynchronously take the page with the uncorrected error
    offline to prevent additional machine check faults.  H/t to Miaohe Lin
    <linmiaohe@huawei.com> and Shuai Xue <xueshuai@linux.alibaba.com> for
    pointing me to the existing function to queue a call to memory_failure().
    
    On x86 there is some duplicate reporting (because the error is also
    signalled by the memory controller as well as by the core that triggered
    the machine check).  Console logs look like this:
    
    This patch (of 2):
    
    If the kernel is copying a page as the result of a copy-on-write
    fault and runs into an uncorrectable error, Linux will crash because
    it does not have recovery code for this case where poison is consumed
    by the kernel.
    
    It is easy to set up a test case. Just inject an error into a private
    page, fork(2), and have the child process write to the page.
    
    I wrapped that neatly into a test at:
    
      git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/aegl/ras-tools.git
    
    just enable ACPI error injection and run:
    
      # ./einj_mem-uc -f copy-on-write
    
    Add a new copy_user_highpage_mc() function that uses copy_mc_to_kernel()
    on architectures where that is available (currently x86 and powerpc).
    When an error is detected during the page copy, return VM_FAULT_HWPOISON
    to caller of wp_page_copy(). This propagates up the call stack. Both x86
    and powerpc have code in their fault handler to deal with this code by
    sending a SIGBUS to the application.
    
    Note that this patch avoids a system crash and signals the process that
    triggered the copy-on-write action. It does not take any action for the
    memory error that is still in the shared page. To handle that a call to
    memory_failure() is needed. But this cannot be done from wp_page_copy()
    because it holds mmap_lock(). Perhaps the architecture fault handlers
    can deal with this loose end in a subsequent patch?
    
    On Intel/x86 this loose end will often be handled automatically because
    the memory controller provides an additional notification of the h/w
    poison in memory, the handler for this will call memory_failure(). This
    isn't a 100% solution. If there are multiple errors, not all may be
    logged in this way.

    mptcp: consolidate fallback and non fallback state machine
    
    commit 81c1d029016001f994ce1c46849c5e9900d8eab8 upstream.
    
    An orphaned msk releases the used resources via the worker,
    when the latter first see the msk in CLOSED status.
    
    If the msk status transitions to TCP_CLOSE in the release callback
    invoked by the worker's final release_sock(), such instance of the
    workqueue will not take any action.
    
    Additionally the MPTCP code prevents scheduling the worker once the
    socket reaches the CLOSE status: such msk resources will be leaked.
    
    The only code path that can trigger the above scenario is the
    __mptcp_check_send_data_fin() in fallback mode.
    
    Address the issue removing the special handling of fallback socket
    in __mptcp_check_send_data_fin(), consolidating the state machine
    for fallback and non fallback socket.
    
    Since non-fallback sockets do not send and do not receive data_fin,
    the mptcp code can update the msk internal status to match the next
    step in the SM every time data fin (ack) should be generated or
    received.
    
    As a consequence we can remove a bunch of checks for fallback from
    the fastpath.
