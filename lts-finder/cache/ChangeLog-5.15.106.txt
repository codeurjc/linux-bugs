    x86/PVH: avoid 32-bit build warning when obtaining VGA console info
    
    commit aadbd07ff8a75ed342388846da78dfaddb8b106a upstream.
    
    In the commit referenced below I failed to pay attention to this code
    also being buildable as 32-bit. Adjust the type of "ret" - there's no
    real need for it to be wider than 32 bits.

    hsr: ratelimit only when errors are printed
    
    commit 1b0120e4db0bf2838d1ce741195ce4b7cc100b91 upstream.
    
    Recently, when automatically merging -net and net-next in MPTCP devel
    tree, our CI reported [1] a conflict in hsr, the same as the one
    reported by Stephen in netdev [2].
    
    When looking at the conflict, I noticed it is in fact the v1 [3] that
    has been applied in -net and the v2 [4] in net-next. Maybe the v1 was
    applied by accident.
    
    As mentioned by Jakub Kicinski [5], the new condition makes more sense
    before the net_ratelimit(), not to update net_ratelimit's state which is
    unnecessary if we're not going to print either way.
    
    Here, this modification applies the v2 but in -net.

    libbpf: Fix btf_dump's packed struct determination
    
    [ Upstream commit 4fb877aaa179dcdb1676d55216482febaada457e ]
    
    Fix bug in btf_dump's logic of determining if a given struct type is
    packed or not. The notion of "natural alignment" is not needed and is
    even harmful in this case, so drop it altogether. The biggest difference
    in btf_is_struct_packed() compared to its original implementation is
    that we don't really use btf__align_of() to determine overall alignment
    of a struct type (because it could be 1 for both packed and non-packed
    struct, depending on specifci field definitions), and just use field's
    actual alignment to calculate whether any field is requiring packing or
    struct's size overall necessitates packing.
    
    Add two simple test cases that demonstrate the difference this change
    would make.

    libbpf: Fix BTF-to-C converter's padding logic
    
    [ Upstream commit ea2ce1ba99aa6a60c8d8a706e3abadf3de372163 ]
    
    Turns out that btf_dump API doesn't handle a bunch of tricky corner
    cases, as reported by Per, and further discovered using his testing
    Python script ([0]).
    
    This patch revamps btf_dump's padding logic significantly, making it
    more correct and also avoiding unnecessary explicit padding, where
    compiler would pad naturally. This overall topic turned out to be very
    tricky and subtle, there are lots of subtle corner cases. The comments
    in the code tries to give some clues, but comments themselves are
    supposed to be paired with good understanding of C alignment and padding
    rules. Plus some experimentation to figure out subtle things like
    whether `long :0;` means that struct is now forced to be long-aligned
    (no, it's not, turns out).
    
    Anyways, Per's script, while not completely correct in some known
    situations, doesn't show any obvious cases where this logic breaks, so
    this is a nice improvement over the previous state of this logic.
    
    Some selftests had to be adjusted to accommodate better use of natural
    alignment rules, eliminating some unnecessary padding, or changing it to
    `type: 0;` alignment markers.
    
    Note also that for when we are in between bitfields, we emit explicit
    bit size, while otherwise we use `: 0`, this feels much more natural in
    practice.
    
    Next patch will add few more test cases, found through randomized Per's
    script.

    KVM: x86: Purge "highest ISR" cache when updating APICv state
    
    commit 97a71c444a147ae41c7d0ab5b3d855d7f762f3ed upstream.
    
    Purge the "highest ISR" cache when updating APICv state on a vCPU.  The
    cache must not be used when APICv is active as hardware may emulate EOIs
    (and other operations) without exiting to KVM.
    
    This fixes a bug where KVM will effectively block IRQs in perpetuity due
    to the "highest ISR" never getting reset if APICv is activated on a vCPU
    while an IRQ is in-service.  Hardware emulates the EOI and KVM never gets
    a chance to update its cache.

    KVM: VMX: Move preemption timer <=> hrtimer dance to common x86
    
    commit 98c25ead5eda5e9d41abe57839ad3e8caf19500c upstream.
    
    Handle the switch to/from the hypervisor/software timer when a vCPU is
    blocking in common x86 instead of in VMX.  Even though VMX is the only
    user of a hypervisor timer, the logic and all functions involved are
    generic x86 (unless future CPUs do something completely different and
    implement a hypervisor timer that runs regardless of mode).
    
    Handling the switch in common x86 will allow for the elimination of the
    pre/post_blocks hooks, and also lets KVM switch back to the hypervisor
    timer if and only if it was in use (without additional params).  Add a
    comment explaining why the switch cannot be deferred to kvm_sched_out()
    or kvm_vcpu_block().

    KVM: arm64: Disable interrupts while walking userspace PTs
    
    commit e86fc1a3a3e9b4850fe74d738e3cfcf4297d8bba upstream.
    
    We walk the userspace PTs to discover what mapping size was
    used there. However, this can race against the userspace tables
    being freed, and we end-up in the weeds.
    
    Thankfully, the mm code is being generous and will IPI us when
    doing so. So let's implement our part of the bargain and disable
    interrupts around the walk. This ensures that nothing terrible
    happens during that time.
    
    We still need to handle the removal of the page tables before
    the walk. For that, allow get_user_mapping_size() to return an
    error, and make sure this error can be propagated all the way
    to the the exit handler.

    xtensa: fix KASAN report for show_stack
    
    commit 1d3b7a788ca7435156809a6bd5b20c95b2370d45 upstream.
    
    show_stack dumps raw stack contents which may trigger an unnecessary
    KASAN report. Fix it by copying stack contents to a temporary buffer
    with __memcpy and then printing that buffer instead of passing stack
    pointer directly to the print_hex_dump.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix regression on detection of Roland VS-100
    
    commit fa4e7a6fa12b1132340785e14bd439cbe95b7a5a upstream.
    
    It's been reported that the recent kernel can't probe the PCM devices
    on Roland VS-100 properly, and it turned out to be a regression by the
    recent addition of the bit shift range check for the format bits.
    In the old code, we just did bit-shift and it resulted in zero, which
    is then corrected to the standard PCM format, while the new code
    explicitly returns an error in such a case.
    
    For addressing the regression, relax the check and fallback to the
    standard PCM type (with the info output).

    ALSA: hda/conexant: Partial revert of a quirk for Lenovo
    
    commit b871cb971c683f7f212e7ca3c9a6709a75785116 upstream.
    
    The recent commit f83bb2592482 ("ALSA: hda/conexant: Add quirk for
    LENOVO 20149 Notebook model") introduced a quirk for the device with
    17aa:3977, but this caused a regression on another model (Lenovo
    Ideadpad U31) with the very same PCI SSID.  And, through skimming over
    the net, it seems that this PCI SSID is used for multiple different
    models, so it's no good idea to apply the quirk with the SSID.
    
    Although we may take a different ID check (e.g. the codec SSID instead
    of the PCI SSID), unfortunately, the original patch author couldn't
    identify the hardware details any longer as the machine was returned,
    and we can't develop the further proper fix.
    
    In this patch, instead, we partially revert the change so that the
    quirk won't be applied as default for addressing the regression.
    Meanwhile, the quirk function itself is kept, and it's now made to be
    applicable via the explicit model=lenovo-20149 option.

    from my (arguably very short) checking is not commonly done for other

    the task does something that causes a coredump to be generated. Then we
    get this crash:

    Since commit d59f6617eef0 ("genirq: Allow fwnode to carry name

    Drop the no longer valid name assignment, which would lead to an attempt
    to free a string constant when removing the domain on late probe
    failures (e.g. probe deferral).

    pinctrl: amd: Disable and mask interrupts on resume
    
    commit b26cd9325be4c1fcd331b77f10acb627c560d4d7 upstream.
    
    This fixes a similar problem to the one observed in:
    commit 4e5a04be88fe ("pinctrl: amd: disable and mask interrupts on probe").
    
    On some systems, during suspend/resume cycle firmware leaves
    an interrupt enabled on a pin that is not used by the kernel.
    This confuses the AMD pinctrl driver and causes spurious interrupts.
    
    The driver already has logic to detect if a pin is used by the kernel.
    Leverage it to re-initialize interrupt fields of a pin only if it's not
    used by us.

    net: phy: dp83869: fix default value for tx-/rx-internal-delay
    
    commit 82e2c39f9ef78896e9b634dfd82dc042e6956bb7 upstream.
    
    dp83869 internally uses a look-up table for mapping supported delays in
    nanoseconds to register values.
    When specific delays are defined in device-tree, phy_get_internal_delay
    does the lookup automatically returning an index.
    
    The default case wrongly assigns the nanoseconds value from the lookup
    table, resulting in numeric value 2000 applied to delay configuration
    register, rather than the expected index values 0-7 (7 for 2000).
    Ultimately this issue broke RX for 1Gbps links.
    
    Fix default delay configuration by assigning the intended index value
    directly.

    can: j1939: prevent deadlock by moving j1939_sk_errqueue()
    
    commit d1366b283d94ac4537a4b3a1e8668da4df7ce7e9 upstream.
    
    This commit addresses a deadlock situation that can occur in certain
    scenarios, such as when running data TP/ETP transfer and subscribing to
    the error queue while receiving a net down event. The deadlock involves
    locks in the following order:
    
    3
      j1939_session_list_lock ->  active_session_list_lock
      j1939_session_activate
      ...
      j1939_sk_queue_activate_next -> sk_session_queue_lock
      ...
      j1939_xtp_rx_eoma_one
    
    2
      j1939_sk_queue_drop_all  ->  sk_session_queue_lock
      ...
      j1939_sk_netdev_event_netdown -> j1939_socks_lock
      j1939_netdev_notify
    
    1
      j1939_sk_errqueue -> j1939_socks_lock
      __j1939_session_cancel -> active_session_list_lock
      j1939_tp_rxtimer
    
           CPU0                    CPU1
           ----                    ----
      lock(&priv->active_session_list_lock);
                                   lock(&jsk->sk_session_queue_lock);
                                   lock(&priv->active_session_list_lock);
      lock(&priv->j1939_socks_lock);
    
    The solution implemented in this commit is to move the
    j1939_sk_errqueue() call out of the active_session_list_lock context,
    thus preventing the deadlock situation.

    zonefs: Always invalidate last cached page on append write
    
    commit c1976bd8f23016d8706973908f2bb0ac0d852a8f upstream.
    
    When a direct append write is executed, the append offset may correspond
    to the last page of a sequential file inode which might have been cached
    already by buffered reads, page faults with mmap-read or non-direct
    readahead. To ensure that the on-disk and cached data is consistant for
    such last cached page, make sure to always invalidate it in
    zonefs_file_dio_append(). If the invalidation fails, return -EBUSY to
    userspace to differentiate from IO errors.
    
    This invalidation will always be a no-op when the FS block size (device
    zone write granularity) is equal to the page size (e.g. 4K).

    btrfs: scan device in non-exclusive mode
    
    commit 50d281fc434cb8e2497f5e70a309ccca6b1a09f0 upstream.
    
    This fixes mkfs/mount/check failures due to race with systemd-udevd
    scan.
    
    During the device scan initiated by systemd-udevd, other user space
    EXCL operations such as mkfs, mount, or check may get blocked and result
    in a "Device or resource busy" error. This is because the device
    scan process opens the device with the EXCL flag in the kernel.
    
    Two reports were received:
    
     - btrfs/179 test case, where the fsck command failed with the -EBUSY
       error
    
     - LTP pwritev03 test case, where mkfs.vfs failed with
       the -EBUSY error, when mkfs.vfs tried to overwrite old btrfs filesystem
       on the device.
    
    In both cases, fsck and mkfs (respectively) were racing with a
    systemd-udevd device scan, and systemd-udevd won, resulting in the
    -EBUSY error for fsck and mkfs.
    
    Reproducing the problem has been difficult because there is a very
    small window during which these userspace threads can race to
    acquire the exclusive device open. Even on the system where the problem
    was observed, the problem occurrences were anywhere between 10 to 400
    iterations and chances of reproducing decreases with debug printk()s.
    
    However, an exclusive device open is unnecessary for the scan process,
    as there are no write operations on the device during scan. Furthermore,
    during the mount process, the superblock is re-read in the below
    function call chain:
    
      btrfs_mount_root
       btrfs_open_devices
        open_fs_devices
         btrfs_open_one_device
           btrfs_get_bdev_and_sb
    
    So, to fix this issue, removes the FMODE_EXCL flag from the scan
    operation, and add a comment.
    
    The case where mkfs may still write to the device and a scan is running,
    the btrfs signature is not written at that time so scan will not
    recognize such device.

    btrfs: fix race between quota disable and quota assign ioctls
    
    commit 2f1a6be12ab6c8470d5776e68644726c94257c54 upstream.
    
    The quota assign ioctl can currently run in parallel with a quota disable
    ioctl call. The assign ioctl uses the quota root, while the disable ioctl
    frees that root, and therefore we can have a use-after-free triggered in
    the assign ioctl, leading to a trace like the following when KASAN is
    enabled:

    Fix this by having the qgroup assign ioctl take the qgroup ioctl mutex
    before calling btrfs_run_qgroups(), which is what all qgroup ioctls should
    call.

    Input: goodix - add Lenovo Yoga Book X90F to nine_bytes_report DMI table
    
    commit 8a0432bab6ea3203d220785da7ab3c7677f70ecb upstream.
    
    The Android Lenovo Yoga Book X90F / X90L uses the same goodix touchscreen
    with 9 bytes touch reports for its touch keyboard as the already supported
    Windows Lenovo Yoga Book X91F/L, add a DMI match for this to
    the nine_bytes_report DMI table.
    
    When the quirk for the X91F/L was initially added it was written to
    also apply to the X90F/L but this does not work because the Android
    version of the Yoga Book uses completely different DMI strings.
    Also adjust the X91F/L quirk to reflect that it only applies to
    the X91F/L models.

    cifs: fix DFS traversal oops without CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL
    
    commit 179a88a8558bbf42991d361595281f3e45d7edfc upstream.
    
    When compiled with CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL disabled, cifs_dfs_d_automount
    is NULL. cifs.ko logic for mapping CIFS_FATTR_DFS_REFERRAL attributes to
    S_AUTOMOUNT and corresponding dentry flags is retained regardless of
    CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference in
    VFS follow_automount() when traversing a DFS referral link:
      BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
      ...
      Call Trace:

    This fix adds an inline cifs_dfs_d_automount() {return -EREMOTE} handler
    when CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL is disabled. An alternative would be to
    avoid flagging S_AUTOMOUNT, etc. without CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL. This
    approach was chosen as it provides more control over the error path.

    cifs: prevent infinite recursion in CIFSGetDFSRefer()
    
    commit 09ba47b44d26b475bbdf9c80db9e0193d2b58956 upstream.
    
    We can't call smb_init() in CIFSGetDFSRefer() as cifs_reconnect_tcon()
    may end up calling CIFSGetDFSRefer() again to get new DFS referrals
    and thus causing an infinite recursion.

    commit 8980f190947ba29f23110408e712444884b74251 upstream.
    
    The recent change of -funsigned-char causes additions of negative
    numbers to become additions of large positive numbers, leading to wrong
    calculations of mouse movement. Change these casts to be explicitly
    signed, to take into account negative offsets.

    Input: alps - fix compatibility with -funsigned-char
    
    commit 754ff5060daf5a1cf4474eff9b4edeb6c17ef7ab upstream.
    
    The AlpsPS/2 code previously relied on the assumption that `char` is a
    signed type, which was true on x86 platforms (the only place where this
    driver is used) before kernel 6.2. However, on 6.2 and later, this
    assumption is broken due to the introduction of -funsigned-char as a new
    global compiler flag.
    
    Fix this by explicitly specifying the signedness of `char` when sign
    extending the values received from the device.

    pinctrl: ocelot: Fix alt mode for ocelot
    
    [ Upstream commit 657fd9da2d4b4aa0a384105b236baa22fa0233bf ]
    
    In case the driver was trying to set an alternate mode for gpio
    0 or 32 then the mode was not set correctly. The reason is that
    there is computation error inside the function ocelot_pinmux_set_mux
    because in this case it was trying to shift to left by -1.
    Fix this by actually shifting the function bits and not the position.

    net: ipa: compute DMA pool size properly
    
    [ Upstream commit 6c75dc94f2b27fff57b305af9236eea181a00b6c ]
    
    In gsi_trans_pool_init_dma(), the total size of a pool of memory
    used for DMA transactions is calculated.  However the calculation is
    done incorrectly.
    
    For 4KB pages, this total size is currently always more than one
    page, and as a result, the calculation produces a positive (though
    incorrect) total size.  The code still works in this case; we just
    end up with fewer DMA pool entries than we intended.
    
    Bjorn Andersson tested booting a kernel with 16KB pages, and hit a
    null pointer derereference in sg_alloc_append_table_from_pages(),
    descending from gsi_trans_pool_init_dma().  The cause of this was
    that a 16KB total size was going to be allocated, and with 16KB
    pages the order of that allocation is 0.  The total_size calculation
    yielded 0, which eventually led to the crash.
    
    Correcting the total_size calculation fixes the problem.

    ice: fix invalid check for empty list in ice_sched_assoc_vsi_to_agg()
    
    [ Upstream commit e9a1cc2e4c4ee7c7e60fb26345618c2522a2a10f ]
    
    The code implicitly assumes that the list iterator finds a correct
    handle. If 'vsi_handle' is not found the 'old_agg_vsi_info' was
    pointing to an bogus memory location. For safety a separate list
    iterator variable should be used to make the != NULL check on
    'old_agg_vsi_info' correct under any circumstances.
    
    Additionally Linus proposed to avoid any use of the list iterator
    variable after the loop, in the attempt to move the list iterator
    variable declaration into the macro to avoid any potential misuse after
    the loop. Using it in a pointer comparison after the loop is undefined
    behavior and should be omitted if possible [1].

    ice: add profile conflict check for AVF FDIR
    
    [ Upstream commit 29486b6df3e6a63b57d1ed1dce06051267282ff4 ]
    
    Add profile conflict check while adding some FDIR rules to avoid
    unexpected flow behavior, rules may have conflict including:
            IPv4 <---> {IPv4_UDP, IPv4_TCP, IPv4_SCTP}
            IPv6 <---> {IPv6_UDP, IPv6_TCP, IPv6_SCTP}
    
    For example, when we create an FDIR rule for IPv4, this rule will work
    on packets including IPv4, IPv4_UDP, IPv4_TCP and IPv4_SCTP. But if we
    then create an FDIR rule for IPv4_UDP and then destroy it, the first
    FDIR rule for IPv4 cannot work on pkt IPv4_UDP then.
    
    To prevent this unexpected behavior, we add restriction in software
    when creating FDIR rules by adding necessary profile conflict check.

    smsc911x: avoid PHY being resumed when interface is not up
    
    [ Upstream commit f22c993f31fa9615df46e49cd768b713d39a852f ]
    
    SMSC911x doesn't need mdiobus suspend/resume, that's why it sets
    'mac_managed_pm'. However, setting it needs to be moved from init to
    probe, so mdiobus PM functions will really never be called (e.g. when
    the interface is not up yet during suspend/resume).

    loop: LOOP_CONFIGURE: send uevents for partitions
    
    [ Upstream commit bb430b69422640891b0b8db762885730579a4145 ]
    
    LOOP_CONFIGURE is, as far as I understand it, supposed to be a way to
    combine LOOP_SET_FD and LOOP_SET_STATUS64 into a single syscall.  When
    using LOOP_SET_FD+LOOP_SET_STATUS64, a single uevent would be sent for
    each partition found on the loop device after the second ioctl(), but
    when using LOOP_CONFIGURE, no such uevent was being sent.
    
    In the old setup, uevents are disabled for LOOP_SET_FD, but not for
    LOOP_SET_STATUS64.  This makes sense, as it prevents uevents being
    sent for a partially configured device during LOOP_SET_FD - they're
    only sent at the end of LOOP_SET_STATUS64.  But for LOOP_CONFIGURE,
    uevents were disabled for the entire operation, so that final
    notification was never issued.  To fix this, reduce the critical
    section to exclude the loop_reread_partitions() call, which causes
    the uevents to be issued, to after uevents are re-enabled, matching
    the behaviour of the LOOP_SET_FD+LOOP_SET_STATUS64 combination.
    
    I noticed this because Busybox's losetup program recently changed from
    using LOOP_SET_FD+LOOP_SET_STATUS64 to LOOP_CONFIGURE, and this broke
    my setup, for which I want a notification from the kernel any time a
    new partition becomes available.

    loop: suppress uevents while reconfiguring the device
    
    [ Upstream commit 498ef5c777d9c89693b70cc453b40c392120ea1b ]
    
    Currently, udev change event is generated for a loop device before the
    device is ready for IO. Due to serialization on lo->lo_mutex in
    lo_open() this does not matter because anybody is able to open the
    device and do IO only after the configuration is finished. However this
    synchronization in lo_open() is going away so make sure userspace
    reacting to the change event will see the new device state by generating
    the event only when the device is setup.

    s390/vfio-ap: fix memory leak in vfio_ap device driver
    
    [ Upstream commit 8f8cf767589f2131ae5d40f3758429095c701c84 ]
    
    The device release callback function invoked to release the matrix device
    uses the dev_get_drvdata(device *dev) function to retrieve the
    pointer to the vfio_matrix_dev object in order to free its storage. The
    problem is, this object is not stored as drvdata with the device; since the
    kfree function will accept a NULL pointer, the memory for the
    vfio_matrix_dev object is never freed.
    
    Since the device being released is contained within the vfio_matrix_dev
    object, the container_of macro will be used to retrieve its pointer.

    memory. This triggers 'uninit-value' issue.
    
    This patch will add 'memcpy_from_msg' possible errors processing to
    avoid uninit-value issue.

    platform/x86/intel/pmc: Alder Lake PCH slp_s0_residency fix
    
    [ Upstream commit fb5755100a0a5aa5957bdb204fd1e249684557fc ]
    
    For platforms with Alder Lake PCH (Alder Lake S and Raptor Lake S) the
    slp_s0_residency attribute has been reporting the wrong value. Unlike other
    platforms, ADL PCH does not have a counter for the time that the SLP_S0
    signal was asserted. Instead, firmware uses the aggregate of the Low Power
    Mode (LPM) substate counters as the S0ix value.  Since the LPM counters run
    at a different frequency, this lead to misreporting of the S0ix time.
    
    Add a check for Alder Lake PCH and adjust the frequency accordingly when
    display slp_s0_residency.

    net: stmmac: don't reject VLANs when IFF_PROMISC is set
    
    [ Upstream commit a7602e7332b97cfbec7bacb0f1ade99a575fe104 ]
    
    The blamed commit has introduced the following tests to
    dwmac4_add_hw_vlan_rx_fltr(), called from stmmac_vlan_rx_add_vid():
    
            if (hw->promisc) {
                    netdev_err(dev,
                               "Adding VLAN in promisc mode not supported\n");
                    return -EPERM;
            }
    
    "VLAN promiscuous" mode is keyed in this driver to IFF_PROMISC, and so,
    vlan_vid_add() and vlan_vid_del() calls cannot take place in IFF_PROMISC
    mode. I have the following 2 arguments that this restriction is.... hm,
    how shall I put it nicely... unproductive :)
    
    First, take the case of a Linux bridge. If the kernel is compiled with
    CONFIG_BRIDGE_VLAN_FILTERING=y, then this bridge shall have a VLAN
    database. The bridge shall try to call vlan_add_vid() on its bridge
    ports for each VLAN in the VLAN table. It will do this irrespectively of
    whether that port is *currently* VLAN-aware or not. So it will do this
    even when the bridge was created with vlan_filtering 0.
    But the Linux bridge, in VLAN-unaware mode, configures its ports in
    promiscuous (IFF_PROMISC) mode, so that they accept packets with any
    MAC DA (a switch must do this in order to forward those packets which
    are not directly targeted to its MAC address).
    
    As a result, the stmmac driver does not work as a bridge port, when the
    kernel is compiled with CONFIG_BRIDGE_VLAN_FILTERING=y.
    
    $ ip link add br0 type bridge && ip link set br0 up
    $ ip link set eth0 master br0 && ip link set eth0 up
    [ 2333.943296] br0: port 1(eth0) entered blocking state
    [ 2333.943381] br0: port 1(eth0) entered disabled state
    [ 2333.943782] device eth0 entered promiscuous mode
    [ 2333.944080] 4033c000.ethernet eth0: Adding VLAN in promisc mode not supported
    [ 2333.976509] 4033c000.ethernet eth0: failed to initialize vlan filtering on this port
    RTNETLINK answers: Operation not permitted
    
    Secondly, take the case of stmmac as DSA master. Some switch tagging
    protocols are based on 802.1Q VLANs (tag_sja1105.c), and as such,
    tag_8021q.c uses vlan_vid_add() to work with VLAN-filtering DSA masters.
    But also, when a DSA port becomes promiscuous (for example when it joins
    a bridge), the DSA framework also makes the DSA master promiscuous.
    
    Moreover, for every VLAN that a DSA switch sends to the CPU, DSA also
    programs a VLAN filter on the DSA master, because if the the DSA switch
    uses a tail tag, then the hardware frame parser of the DSA master will
    see VLAN as VLAN, and might filter them out, for being unknown.
    
    Due to the above 2 reasons, my belief is that the stmmac driver does not
    get to choose to not accept vlan_vid_add() calls while IFF_PROMISC is
    enabled, because the 2 are completely independent and there are code
    paths in the network stack which directly lead to this situation
    occurring, without the user's direct input.
    
    In fact, my belief is that "VLAN promiscuous" mode should have never
    been keyed on IFF_PROMISC in the first place, but rather, on the
    NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_CTAG_FILTER feature flag which can be toggled by the
    user through ethtool -k, when present in netdev->hw_features.
    
    In the stmmac driver, NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_CTAG_FILTER is only present in
    "features", making this feature "on [fixed]".
    
    I have this belief because I am unaware of any definition of promiscuity
    which implies having an effect on anything other than MAC DA (therefore
    not VLAN). However, I seem to be rather alone in having this opinion,
    looking back at the disagreements from this discussion:
    https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/20201110153958.ci5ekor3o2ekg3ky@ipetronik.com/
    
    In any case, to remove the vlan_vid_add() dependency on !IFF_PROMISC,
    one would need to remove the check and see what fails. I guess the test
    was there because of the way in which dwmac4_vlan_promisc_enable() is
    implemented.
    
    For context, the dwmac4 supports Perfect Filtering for a limited number
    of VLANs - dwmac4_get_num_vlan(), priv->hw->num_vlan, with a fallback on
    Hash Filtering - priv->dma_cap.vlhash - see stmmac_vlan_update(), also
    visible in cat /sys/kernel/debug/stmmaceth/eth0/dma_cap | grep 'VLAN
    Hash Filtering'.
    
    The perfect filtering is based on MAC_VLAN_Tag_Filter/MAC_VLAN_Tag_Data
    registers, accessed in the driver through dwmac4_write_vlan_filter().
    
    The hash filtering is based on the MAC_VLAN_Hash_Table register, named
    GMAC_VLAN_HASH_TABLE in the driver and accessed by dwmac4_update_vlan_hash().
    The control bit for enabling hash filtering is GMAC_VLAN_VTHM
    (MAC_VLAN_Tag_Ctrl bit VTHM: VLAN Tag Hash Table Match Enable).
    
    Now, the description of dwmac4_vlan_promisc_enable() is that it iterates
    through the driver's cache of perfect filter entries (hw->vlan_filter[i],
    added by dwmac4_add_hw_vlan_rx_fltr()), and evicts them from hardware by
    unsetting their GMAC_VLAN_TAG_DATA_VEN (MAC_VLAN_Tag_Data bit VEN - VLAN
    Tag Enable) bit. Then it unsets the GMAC_VLAN_VTHM bit, which disables
    hash matching.
    
    This leaves the MAC, according to table "VLAN Match Status" from the
    documentation, to always enter these data paths:
    
    VID    |VLAN Perfect Filter |VTHM Bit |VLAN Hash Filter |Final VLAN Match
           |Match Result        |         |Match Result     |Status
    -------|--------------------|---------|-----------------|----------------
    VID!=0 |Fail                |0        |don't care       |Pass
    
    So, dwmac4_vlan_promisc_enable() does its job, but by unsetting
    GMAC_VLAN_VTHM, it conflicts with the other code path which controls
    this bit: dwmac4_update_vlan_hash(), called through stmmac_update_vlan_hash()
    from stmmac_vlan_rx_add_vid() and from stmmac_vlan_rx_kill_vid().
    This is, I guess, why dwmac4_add_hw_vlan_rx_fltr() is not allowed to run
    after dwmac4_vlan_promisc_enable() has unset GMAC_VLAN_VTHM: because if
    it did, then dwmac4_update_vlan_hash() would set GMAC_VLAN_VTHM again,
    breaking the "VLAN promiscuity".
    
    It turns out that dwmac4_vlan_promisc_enable() is way too complicated
    for what needs to be done. The MAC_Packet_Filter register also has the
    VTFE bit (VLAN Tag Filter Enable), which simply controls whether VLAN
    tagged packets which don't match the filtering tables (either perfect or
    hash) are dropped or not. At the moment, this driver unconditionally
    sets GMAC_PACKET_FILTER_VTFE if NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_CTAG_FILTER was detected
    through the priv->dma_cap.vlhash capability bits of the device, in
    stmmac_dvr_probe().
    
    I would suggest deleting the unnecessarily complex logic from
    dwmac4_vlan_promisc_enable(), and simply unsetting GMAC_PACKET_FILTER_VTFE
    when becoming IFF_PROMISC, which has the same effect of allowing packets
    with any VLAN tags, but has the additional benefit of being able to run
    concurrently with stmmac_vlan_rx_add_vid() and stmmac_vlan_rx_kill_vid().
    
    As much as I believe that the VTFE bit should have been exclusively
    controlled by NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_CTAG_FILTER through ethtool, and not by
    IFF_PROMISC, changing that is not a punctual fix to the problem, and it
    would probably break the VFFQ feature added by the later commit
    e0f9956a3862 ("net: stmmac: Add option for VLAN filter fail queue
    enable"). From the commit description, VFFQ needs IFF_PROMISC=on and
    VTFE=off in order to work (and this change respects that). But if VTFE
    was changed to be controlled through ethtool -k, then a user-visible
    change would have been introduced in Intel's scripts (a need to run
    "ethtool -k eth0 rx-vlan-filter off" which did not exist before).
    
    The patch was tested with this set of commands:
    
      ip link set eth0 up
      ip link add link eth0 name eth0.100 type vlan id 100
      ip addr add 192.168.100.2/24 dev eth0.100 && ip link set eth0.100 up
      ip link set eth0 promisc on
      ip link add link eth0 name eth0.101 type vlan id 101
      ip addr add 192.168.101.2/24 dev eth0.101 && ip link set eth0.101 up
      ip link set eth0 promisc off
      ping -c 5 192.168.100.1
      ping -c 5 192.168.101.1
      ip link set eth0 promisc on
      ping -c 5 192.168.100.1
      ping -c 5 192.168.101.1
      ip link del eth0.100
      ip link del eth0.101
      # Wait for VLAN-tagged pings from the other end...
      # Check with "tcpdump -i eth0 -e -n -p" and we should see them
      ip link set eth0 promisc off
      # Wait for VLAN-tagged pings from the other end...
      # Check with "tcpdump -i eth0 -e -n -p" and we shouldn't see them
      # anymore, but remove the "-p" argument from tcpdump and they're there.

    net/net_failover: fix txq exceeding warning
    
    [ Upstream commit e3cbdcb0fbb61045ef3ce0e072927cc41737f787 ]
    
    The failover txq is inited as 16 queues.
    when a packet is transmitted from the failover device firstly,
    the failover device will select the queue which is returned from
    the primary device if the primary device is UP and running.
    If the primary device txq is bigger than the default 16,
    it can lead to the following warning:
    eth0 selects TX queue 18, but real number of TX queues is 16
    
    The warning backtrace is:

    net: dsa: microchip: ksz8863_smi: fix bulk access
    
    [ Upstream commit 392ff7a84cbca34118ca286dfbfe8aee24605897 ]
    
    Current regmap bulk access is broken, resulting to wrong reads/writes
    if ksz_read64/ksz_write64 functions are used.
    Mostly this issue was visible by using ksz8_fdb_dump(), which returned
    corrupt MAC address.
    
    The reason is that regmap was configured to have max_raw_read/write,
    even if ksz8863_mdio_read/write functions are able to handle unlimited
    read/write accesses. On ksz_read64 function we are using multiple 32bit
    accesses by incrementing each access by 1 instead of 4. Resulting buffer
    had 01234567.12345678 instead of 01234567.89abcdef.
    
    We have multiple ways to fix it:

    ptp_qoriq: fix memory leak in probe()
    
    [ Upstream commit f33642224e38d7e0d59336e10e7b4e370b1c4506 ]
    
    Smatch complains that:
    drivers/ptp/ptp_qoriq.c ptp_qoriq_probe()
    warn: 'base' from ioremap() not released.
    
    Fix this by revising the parameter from 'ptp_qoriq->base' to 'base'.
    This is only a bug if ptp_qoriq_init() returns on the
    first -ENODEV error path.
    For other error paths ptp_qoriq->base and base are the same.
    And this change makes the code more readable.

    [ Upstream commit ca4a80e4bb7e87daf33b27d2ab9e4f5311018a89 ]
    
    At NIC reset, some offload features related to encapsulated traffic
    might have changed (this mainly happens if the firmware-variant is
    changed with the sfboot userspace tool). Because of this, features are
    checked and set again at reset time.
    
    However, this was not done right, and some features were improperly
    overwritten at NIC reset:
    - Tunneled IPv6 segmentation was always disabled
    - Features disabled with ethtool were reenabled
    - Features that becomes unsupported after the reset were not disabled
    
    Also, checking if the device supports IPV6_CSUM to enable TSO6 is no
    longer necessary because all currently supported devices support it.
    Additionally, move the assignment of some other features to the
    EF10_OFFLOAD_FEATURES macro, like it is done in ef100, leaving the
    selection of features in efx_pci_probe_post_io a bit cleaner.

    SUNRPC: fix shutdown of NFS TCP client socket
    
    [ Upstream commit 943d045a6d796175e5d08f9973953b1d2c07d797 ]
    
    NFS server Duplicate Request Cache (DRC) algorithms rely on NFS clients
    reconnecting using the same local TCP port. Unique NFS operations are
    identified by the per-TCP connection set of XIDs. This prevents file
    corruption when non-idempotent NFS operations are retried.
    
    Currently, NFS client TCP connections are using different local TCP ports
    when reconnecting to NFS servers.
    
    After an NFS server initiates shutdown of the TCP connection, the NFS
    client's TCP socket is set to NULL after the socket state has reached
    TCP_LAST_ACK(9). When reconnecting, the new socket attempts to reuse
    the same local port but fails with EADDRNOTAVAIL (99). This forces the
    socket to use a different local TCP port to reconnect to the remote NFS
    server.
    
    State Transition and Events:
    TCP_CLOSE_WAIT(8)
    TCP_LAST_ACK(9)
    connect(fail EADDRNOTAVAIL(99))
    TCP_CLOSE(7)
    bind on new port
    connect success

    ALSA: usb-audio: Fix recursive locking at XRUN during syncing
    
    [ Upstream commit 8c721c53dda512fdd48eb24d6d99e56deee57898 ]
    
    The recent support of low latency playback in USB-audio driver made
    the snd_usb_queue_pending_output_urbs() function to be called via PCM
    ack ops.  In the new code path, the function is performed already in
    the PCM stream lock.  The problem is that, when an XRUN is detected,
    the function calls snd_pcm_xrun() to notify, but snd_pcm_xrun() is
    supposed to be called only outside the stream lock.  As a result, it
    leads to a deadlock of PCM stream locking.
    
    For avoiding such a recursive locking, this patch adds an additional
    check to the code paths in PCM core that call the ack callback; now it
    checks the error code from the callback, and if it's -EPIPE, the XRUN
    is handled in the PCM core side gracefully.  Along with it, the
    USB-audio driver code is changed to follow that, i.e. -EPIPE is
    returned instead of the explicit snd_pcm_xrun() call when the function
    is performed already in the stream lock.

    ca8210: Fix unsigned mac_len comparison with zero in ca8210_skb_tx()
    
    [ Upstream commit 748b2f5e82d17480404b3e2895388fc2925f7caf ]
    
    mac_len is of type unsigned, which can never be less than zero.
    
            mac_len = ieee802154_hdr_peek_addrs(skb, &header);
            if (mac_len < 0)
                    return mac_len;
    
    Change this to type int as ieee802154_hdr_peek_addrs() can return negative
    integers, this is found by static analysis with smatch.

    Overwriting the error code with the deletion result may cause the
    function to return 0 despite encountering an error. Commit b111545d26c0
    ("tracing: Remove the useless value assignment in
    test_create_synth_event()") solves a similar issue by
    returning the original error code, so this patch does the same.

    sched_getaffinity: don't assume 'cpumask_size()' is fully initialized
    
    [ Upstream commit 6015b1aca1a233379625385feb01dd014aca60b5 ]
    
    The getaffinity() system call uses 'cpumask_size()' to decide how big
    the CPU mask is - so far so good.  It is indeed the allocation size of a
    cpumask.
    
    But the code also assumes that the whole allocation is initialized
    without actually doing so itself.  That's wrong, because we might have
    fixed-size allocations (making copying and clearing more efficient), but
    not all of it is then necessarily used if 'nr_cpu_ids' is smaller.
    
    Having checked other users of 'cpumask_size()', they all seem to be ok,
    either using it purely for the allocation size, or explicitly zeroing
    the cpumask before using the size in bytes to copy it.
    
    See for example the ublk_ctrl_get_queue_affinity() function that uses
    the proper 'zalloc_cpumask_var()' to make sure that the whole mask is
    cleared, whether the storage is on the stack or if it was an external
    allocation.
    
    Fix this by just zeroing the allocation before using it.  Do the same
    for the compat version of sched_getaffinity(), which had the same logic.
    
    Also, for consistency, make sched_getaffinity() use 'cpumask_bits()' to
    access the bits.  For a cpumask_var_t, it ends up being a pointer to the
    same data either way, but it's just a good idea to treat it like you
    would a 'cpumask_t'.  The compat case already did that.

    net: hsr: Don't log netdev_err message on unknown prp dst node
    
    [ Upstream commit 28e8cabe80f3e6e3c98121576eda898eeb20f1b1 ]
    
    If no frames has been exchanged with a node for HSR_NODE_FORGET_TIME, the
    node will be deleted from the node_db list. If a frame is sent to the node
    after it is deleted, a netdev_err message for each slave interface is
    produced. This should not happen with dan nodes because of supervision
    frames, but can happen often with san nodes, which clutters the kernel
    log. Since the hsr protocol does not support sans, this is only relevant
    for the prp protocol.

    md: avoid signed overflow in slot_store()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3bc57292278a0b6ac4656cad94c14f2453344b57 ]
    
    slot_store() uses kstrtouint() to get a slot number, but stores the
    result in an "int" variable (by casting a pointer).
    This can result in a negative slot number if the unsigned int value is
    very large.
    
    A negative number means that the slot is empty, but setting a negative
    slot number this way will not remove the device from the array.  I don't
    think this is a serious problem, but it could cause confusion and it is
    best to fix it.

    xfrm: Zero padding when dumping algos and encap
    
    [ Upstream commit 8222d5910dae08213b6d9d4bc9a7f8502855e624 ]
    
    When copying data to user-space we should ensure that only valid
    data is copied over.  Padding in structures may be filled with
    random (possibly sensitve) data and should never be given directly
    to user-space.
    
    This patch fixes the copying of xfrm algorithms and the encap
    template in xfrm_user so that padding is zeroed.

    kcsan: avoid passing -g for test
    
    [ Upstream commit 5eb39cde1e2487ba5ec1802dc5e58a77e700d99e ]
    
    Nathan reported that when building with GNU as and a version of clang that
    defaults to DWARF5, the assembler will complain with:
    
      Error: non-constant .uleb128 is not supported
    
    This is because `-g` defaults to the compiler debug info default. If the
    assembler does not support some of the directives used, the above errors
    occur. To fix, remove the explicit passing of `-g`.
    
    All the test wants is that stack traces print valid function names, and
    debug info is not required for that. (I currently cannot recall why I
    added the explicit `-g`.)

    usb: dwc3: gadget: Add 1ms delay after end transfer command without IOC
    
    [ Upstream commit d8a2bb4eb75866275b5cf7de2e593ac3449643e2 ]
    
    Previously, there was a 100uS delay inserted after issuing an end transfer
    command for specific controller revisions.  This was due to the fact that
    there was a GUCTL2 bit field which enabled synchronous completion of the
    end transfer command once the CMDACT bit was cleared in the DEPCMD
    register.  Since this bit does not exist for all controller revisions and
    the current implementation heavily relies on utizling the EndTransfer
    command completion interrupt, add the delay back in for uses where the
    interrupt on completion bit is not set, and increase the duration to 1ms
    for the controller to complete the command.
    
    An issue was seen where the USB request buffer was unmapped while the DWC3
    controller was still accessing the TRB.  However, it was confirmed that the
    end transfer command was successfully submitted. (no end transfer timeout)
    In situations, such as dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect() and
    __dwc3_gadget_ep_disable(), the dwc3_remove_request() is utilized, which
    will issue the end transfer command, and follow up with
    dwc3_gadget_giveback().  At least for the USB ep disable path, it is
    required for any pending and started requests to be completed and returned
    to the function driver in the same context of the disable call.  Without
    the GUCTL2 bit, it is not ensured that the end transfer is completed before
    the buffers are unmapped.

    in the pagecache.  But actually it doesn't solve it fully.
    
    Since the incomplete solution for this race condition has too much
    performance impact for it to be worth it, let's remove it for now.
