    mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption
    
    commit 483ae90d8f976f8339cf81066312e1329f2d3706 upstream.
    
    When tc filters are first added to a net device, the corresponding local
    port gets bound to an ACL group in the device. The group contains a list
    of ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the
    filters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially
    evaluated until a match is found.
    
    One reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added
    with decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two
    consecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their
    key usage.
    
    In Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the
    maximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the
    register that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account
    for that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the
    rare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.
    
    Fix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what
    the firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.
    
    Add a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this
    condition is hit.

    nilfs2: replace WARN_ONs for invalid DAT metadata block requests
    
    commit 5124a0a549857c4b87173280e192eea24dea72ad upstream.
    
    If DAT metadata file block access fails due to corruption of the DAT file
    or abnormal virtual block numbers held by b-trees or inodes, a kernel
    warning is generated.
    
    This replaces the WARN_ONs by error output, so that a kernel, booted with
    panic_on_warn, does not panic.  This patch also replaces the detected
    return code -ENOENT with another internal code -EINVAL to notify the bmap
    layer of metadata corruption.  When the bmap layer sees -EINVAL, it
    handles the abnormal situation with nilfs_bmap_convert_error() and finally
    returns code -EIO as it should.

    nilfs2: fix potential bug in end_buffer_async_write
    
    commit 5bc09b397cbf1221f8a8aacb1152650c9195b02b upstream.
    
    According to a syzbot report, end_buffer_async_write(), which handles the
    completion of block device writes, may detect abnormal condition of the
    buffer async_write flag and cause a BUG_ON failure when using nilfs2.
    
    Nilfs2 itself does not use end_buffer_async_write().  But, the async_write
    flag is now used as a marker by commit 7f42ec394156 ("nilfs2: fix issue
    with race condition of competition between segments for dirty blocks") as
    a means of resolving double list insertion of dirty blocks in
    nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() and nilfs_lookup_node_buffers() and the
    resulting crash.
    
    This modification is safe as long as it is used for file data and b-tree
    node blocks where the page caches are independent.  However, it was
    irrelevant and redundant to also introduce async_write for segment summary
    and super root blocks that share buffers with the backing device.  This
    led to the possibility that the BUG_ON check in end_buffer_async_write
    would fail as described above, if independent writebacks of the backing
    device occurred in parallel.
    
    The use of async_write for segment summary buffers has already been
    removed in a previous change.
    
    Fix this issue by removing the manipulation of the async_write flag for
    the remaining super root block buffer.

    bpf: Remove trace_printk_lock
    
    commit e2bb9e01d589f7fa82573aedd2765ff9b277816a upstream.
    
    Both bpf_trace_printk and bpf_trace_vprintk helpers use static buffer guarded
    with trace_printk_lock spin lock.
    
    The spin lock contention causes issues with bpf programs attached to
    contention_begin tracepoint [1][2].
    
    Andrii suggested we could get rid of the contention by using trylock, but we
    could actually get rid of the spinlock completely by using percpu buffers the
    same way as for bin_args in bpf_bprintf_prepare function.
    
    Adding new return 'buf' argument to struct bpf_bprintf_data and making
    bpf_bprintf_prepare to return also the buffer for printk helpers.

    There's possible scenario where this could cause a problem, when
    bpf_bprintf_prepare does not get bin_args buffer (because num_args is 0)
    and following bpf_bprintf_cleanup call decrements bpf_bprintf_nest_level
    variable, like:
    
      in task context:
        bpf_bprintf_prepare(num_args != 0) increments 'bpf_bprintf_nest_level = 1'
        -> first irq :
           bpf_bprintf_prepare(num_args == 0)
           bpf_bprintf_cleanup decrements 'bpf_bprintf_nest_level = 0'
        -> second irq:
           bpf_bprintf_prepare(num_args != 0) bpf_bprintf_nest_level = 1
           gets same buffer as task context above
    
    Adding check to bpf_bprintf_cleanup and doing the real cleanup only if we
    got bin_args data in the first place.

    bpf: Add struct for bin_args arg in bpf_bprintf_prepare
    
    commit 78aa1cc9404399a15d2a1205329c6a06236f5378 upstream.
    
    Adding struct bpf_bprintf_data to hold bin_args argument for
    bpf_bprintf_prepare function.
    
    We will add another return argument to bpf_bprintf_prepare and
    pass the struct to bpf_bprintf_cleanup for proper cleanup in
    following changes.

    net: prevent mss overflow in skb_segment()
    
    commit 23d05d563b7e7b0314e65c8e882bc27eac2da8e7 upstream.
    
    Once again syzbot is able to crash the kernel in skb_segment() [1]
    
    GSO_BY_FRAGS is a forbidden value, but unfortunately the following
    computation in skb_segment() can reach it quite easily :
    
            mss = mss * partial_segs;
    
    65535 = 3 * 5 * 17 * 257, so many initial values of mss can lead to
    a bad final result.
    
    Make sure to limit segmentation so that the new mss value is smaller
    than GSO_BY_FRAGS.

    smb: client: fix parsing of SMB3.1.1 POSIX create context
    
    commit 76025cc2285d9ede3d717fe4305d66f8be2d9346 upstream.
    
    The data offset for the SMB3.1.1 POSIX create context will always be
    8-byte aligned so having the check 'noff + nlen >= doff' in
    smb2_parse_contexts() is wrong as it will lead to -EINVAL because noff
    + nlen == doff.
    
    Fix the sanity check to correctly handle aligned create context data.

    RDMA/irdma: Ensure iWarp QP queue memory is OS paged aligned
    
    commit 0a5ec366de7e94192669ba08de6ed336607fd282 upstream.
    
    The SQ is shared for between kernel and used by storing the kernel page
    pointer and passing that to a kmap_atomic().
    
    This then requires that the alignment is PAGE_SIZE aligned.
    
    Fix by adding an iWarp specific alignment check.

    hrtimer: Ignore slack time for RT tasks in schedule_hrtimeout_range()
    
    commit 0c52310f260014d95c1310364379772cb74cf82d upstream.
    
    While in theory the timer can be triggered before expires + delta, for the
    cases of RT tasks they really have no business giving any lenience for
    extra slack time, so override any passed value by the user and always use
    zero for schedule_hrtimeout_range() calls. Furthermore, this is similar to
    what the nanosleep(2) family already does with current->timer_slack_ns.

    [ Upstream commit 5ea9a7c5fe4149f165f0e3b624fe08df02b6c301 ]
    
    A recent change to check_for_locks() changed it to take ->flc_lock while
    holding ->fi_lock.  This creates a lock inversion (reported by lockdep)
    because there is a case where ->fi_lock is taken while holding
    ->flc_lock.
    
    ->flc_lock is held across ->fl_lmops callbacks, and
    nfsd_break_deleg_cb() is one of those and does take ->fi_lock.  However
    it doesn't need to.
    
    Prior to v4.17-rc1~110^2~22 ("nfsd: create a separate lease for each
    delegation") nfsd_break_deleg_cb() would walk the ->fi_delegations list
    and so needed the lock.  Since then it doesn't walk the list and doesn't
    need the lock.
    
    Two actions are performed under the lock.  One is to call
    nfsd_break_one_deleg which calls nfsd4_run_cb().  These doesn't act on
    the nfs4_file at all, so don't need the lock.
    
    The other is to set ->fi_had_conflict which is in the nfs4_file.
    This field is only ever set here (except when initialised to false)
    so there is no possible problem will multiple threads racing when
    setting it.
    
    The field is tested twice in nfs4_set_delegation().  The first test does
    not hold a lock and is documented as an opportunistic optimisation, so
    it doesn't impose any need to hold ->fi_lock while setting
    ->fi_had_conflict.
    
    The second test in nfs4_set_delegation() *is* make under ->fi_lock, so
    removing the locking when ->fi_had_conflict is set could make a change.
    The change could only be interesting if ->fi_had_conflict tested as
    false even though nfsd_break_one_deleg() ran before ->fi_lock was
    unlocked.  i.e. while hash_delegation_locked() was running.
    As hash_delegation_lock() doesn't interact in any way with nfs4_run_cb()
    there can be no importance to this interaction.
    
    So this patch removes the locking from nfsd_break_one_deleg() and moves
    the final test on ->fi_had_conflict out of the locked region to make it
    clear that locking isn't important to the test.  It is still tested
    *after* vfs_setlease() has succeeded.  This might be significant and as
    vfs_setlease() takes ->flc_lock, and nfsd_break_one_deleg() is called
    under ->flc_lock this "after" is a true ordering provided by a spinlock.

    nfsd: fix RELEASE_LOCKOWNER
    
    [ Upstream commit edcf9725150e42beeca42d085149f4c88fa97afd ]
    
    The test on so_count in nfsd4_release_lockowner() is nonsense and
    harmful.  Revert to using check_for_locks(), changing that to not sleep.
    
    First: harmful.
    As is documented in the kdoc comment for nfsd4_release_lockowner(), the
    test on so_count can transiently return a false positive resulting in a
    return of NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD when in fact no locks are held.  This is
    clearly a protocol violation and with the Linux NFS client it can cause
    incorrect behaviour.
    
    If RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is sent while some other thread is still
    processing a LOCK request which failed because, at the time that request
    was received, the given owner held a conflicting lock, then the nfsd
    thread processing that LOCK request can hold a reference (conflock) to
    the lock owner that causes nfsd4_release_lockowner() to return an
    incorrect error.
    
    The Linux NFS client ignores that NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD error because it
    never sends NFS4_RELEASE_LOCKOWNER without first releasing any locks, so
    it knows that the error is impossible.  It assumes the lock owner was in
    fact released so it feels free to use the same lock owner identifier in
    some later locking request.
    
    When it does reuse a lock owner identifier for which a previous RELEASE
    failed, it will naturally use a lock_seqid of zero.  However the server,
    which didn't release the lock owner, will expect a larger lock_seqid and
    so will respond with NFS4ERR_BAD_SEQID.
    
    So clearly it is harmful to allow a false positive, which testing
    so_count allows.
    
    The test is nonsense because ... well... it doesn't mean anything.
    
    so_count is the sum of three different counts.
    1/ the set of states listed on so_stateids
    2/ the set of active vfs locks owned by any of those states
    3/ various transient counts such as for conflicting locks.
    
    When it is tested against '2' it is clear that one of these is the
    transient reference obtained by find_lockowner_str_locked().  It is not
    clear what the other one is expected to be.
    
    In practice, the count is often 2 because there is precisely one state
    on so_stateids.  If there were more, this would fail.
    
    In my testing I see two circumstances when RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is called.
    In one case, CLOSE is called before RELEASE_LOCKOWNER.  That results in
    all the lock states being removed, and so the lockowner being discarded
    (it is removed when there are no more references which usually happens
    when the lock state is discarded).  When nfsd4_release_lockowner() finds
    that the lock owner doesn't exist, it returns success.
    
    The other case shows an so_count of '2' and precisely one state listed
    in so_stateid.  It appears that the Linux client uses a separate lock
    owner for each file resulting in one lock state per lock owner, so this
    test on '2' is safe.  For another client it might not be safe.
    
    So this patch changes check_for_locks() to use the (newish)
    find_any_file_locked() so that it doesn't take a reference on the
    nfs4_file and so never calls nfsd_file_put(), and so never sleeps.  With
    this check is it safe to restore the use of check_for_locks() rather
    than testing so_count against the mysterious '2'.

    parisc: Fix random data corruption from exception handler
    
    commit 8b1d72395635af45410b66cc4c4ab37a12c4a831 upstream.
    
    The current exception handler implementation, which assists when accessing
    user space memory, may exhibit random data corruption if the compiler decides
    to use a different register than the specified register %r29 (defined in
    ASM_EXCEPTIONTABLE_REG) for the error code. If the compiler choose another
    register, the fault handler will nevertheless store -EFAULT into %r29 and thus
    trash whatever this register is used for.
    Looking at the assembly I found that this happens sometimes in emulate_ldd().
    
    To solve the issue, the easiest solution would be if it somehow is
    possible to tell the fault handler which register is used to hold the error
    code. Using %0 or %1 in the inline assembly is not posssible as it will show
    up as e.g. %r29 (with the "%r" prefix), which the GNU assembler can not
    convert to an integer.
    
    This patch takes another, better and more flexible approach:
    We extend the __ex_table (which is out of the execution path) by one 32-word.
    In this word we tell the compiler to insert the assembler instruction
    "or %r0,%r0,%reg", where %reg references the register which the compiler
    choosed for the error return code.
    In case of an access failure, the fault handler finds the __ex_table entry and
    can examine the opcode. The used register is encoded in the lowest 5 bits, and
    the fault handler can then store -EFAULT into this register.
    
    Since we extend the __ex_table to 3 words we can't use the BUILDTIME_TABLE_SORT
    config option any longer.

    The patch fdb8e12cc2cc ("netfilter: ipset: fix performance regression

    at the error path of create operations and at module unload. Also,
    because the half of the destroy operations now executed by a

    or rcu read lock is held and therefore the checking of them results
    false warnings.

    netfilter: ipset: fix performance regression in swap operation
    
    commit 97f7cf1cd80eeed3b7c808b7c12463295c751001 upstream.
    
    The patch "netfilter: ipset: fix race condition between swap/destroy
    and kernel side add/del/test", commit 28628fa9 fixes a race condition.
    But the synchronize_rcu() added to the swap function unnecessarily slows
    it down: it can safely be moved to destroy and use call_rcu() instead.
    
    Eric Dumazet pointed out that simply calling the destroy functions as
    rcu callback does not work: sets with timeout use garbage collectors
    which need cancelling at destroy which can wait. Therefore the destroy
    functions are split into two: cancelling garbage collectors safely at
    executing the command received by netlink and moving the remaining
    part only into the rcu callback.

    block: fix partial zone append completion handling in req_bio_endio()
    
    [ Upstream commit 748dc0b65ec2b4b7b3dbd7befcc4a54fdcac7988 ]
    
    Partial completions of zone append request is not allowed but if a zone
    append completion indicates a number of completed bytes different from
    the original BIO size, only the BIO status is set to error. This leads
    to bio_advance() not setting the BIO size to 0 and thus to not call
    bio_endio() at the end of req_bio_endio().
    
    Make sure a partially completed zone append is failed and completed
    immediately by forcing the completed number of bytes (nbytes) to be
    equal to the BIO size, thus ensuring that bio_endio() is called.

    [ Upstream commit 7c45b6ddbcff01f9934d11802010cfeb0879e693 ]
    
    The blsp_dma controller is shared between the different subsystems,
    which is why it is already initialized by the firmware. We should not
    reinitialize it from Linux to avoid potential other users of the DMA
    engine to misbehave.
    
    In mainline this can be described using the "qcom,controlled-remotely"
    property. In the downstream/vendor kernel from Qualcomm there is an
    opposite "qcom,managed-locally" property. This property is *not* set
    for the qcom,sps-dma@7884000 [1] so adding "qcom,controlled-remotely"
    upstream matches the behavior of the downstream/vendor kernel.
    
    Adding this seems to fix some weird issues with UART where both
    input/output becomes garbled with certain obscure firmware versions on
    some devices.

    Workaround by adding 100ms delay at checking FW status.

    wifi: mwifiex: Support SD8978 chipset
    
    [ Upstream commit bba047f15851c8b053221f1b276eb7682d59f755 ]
    
    The Marvell SD8978 (aka NXP IW416) uses identical registers as SD8987,
    so reuse the existing mwifiex_reg_sd8987 definition.
    
    Note that mwifiex_reg_sd8977 and mwifiex_reg_sd8997 are likewise
    identical, save for the fw_dump_ctrl register:  They define it as 0xf0
    whereas mwifiex_reg_sd8987 defines it as 0xf9.  I've verified that
    0xf9 is the correct value on SD8978.  NXP's out-of-tree driver uses
    0xf9 for all of them, so there's a chance that 0xf0 is not correct
    in the mwifiex_reg_sd8977 and mwifiex_reg_sd8997 definitions.  I cannot
    test that for lack of hardware, hence am leaving it as is.
    
    NXP has only released a firmware which runs Bluetooth over UART.
    Perhaps Bluetooth over SDIO is unsupported by this chipset.
    Consequently, only an "sdiouart" firmware image is referenced, not an
    alternative "sdsd" image.

    selftests/mm: Update va_high_addr_switch.sh to check CPU for la57 flag
    
    [ Upstream commit 52e63d67b5bb423b33d7a262ac7f8bd375a90145 ]
    
    In order for the page table level 5 to be in use, the CPU must have the
    setting enabled in addition to the CONFIG option. Check for the flag to be
    set to avoid false test failures on systems that do not have this cpu flag
    set.
    
    The test does a series of mmap calls including three using the
    MAP_FIXED flag and specifying an address that is 1<<47 or 1<<48.  These
    addresses are only available if you are using level 5 page tables,
    which requires both the CPU to have the capabiltiy (la57 flag) and the
    kernel to be configured.  Currently the test only checks for the kernel
    configuration option, so this test can still report a false positive.
    Here are the three failing lines:
    
    $ ./va_high_addr_switch | grep FAILED
    mmap(ADDR_SWITCH_HINT, 2 * PAGE_SIZE, MAP_FIXED): 0xffffffffffffffff - FAILED
    mmap(HIGH_ADDR, MAP_FIXED): 0xffffffffffffffff - FAILED
    mmap(ADDR_SWITCH_HINT, 2 * PAGE_SIZE, MAP_FIXED): 0xffffffffffffffff - FAILED
    
    I thought (for about a second) refactoring the test so that these three
    mmap calls will only be run on systems with the level 5 page tables
    available, but the whole point of the test is to check the level 5
    feature...

    selftests/mm: ksm_tests should only MADV_HUGEPAGE valid memory
    
    [ Upstream commit d021b442cf312664811783e92b3d5e4548e92a53 ]
    
    ksm_tests was previously mmapping a region of memory, aligning the
    returned pointer to a PMD boundary, then setting MADV_HUGEPAGE, but was
    setting it past the end of the mmapped area due to not taking the pointer
    alignment into consideration.  Fix this behaviour.
    
    Up until commit efa7df3e3bb5 ("mm: align larger anonymous mappings on THP
    boundaries"), this buggy behavior was (usually) masked because the
    alignment difference was always less than PMD-size.  But since the
    mentioned commit, `ksm_tests -H -s 100` started failing.

    tls: fix NULL deref on tls_sw_splice_eof() with empty record
    
    commit 53f2cb491b500897a619ff6abd72f565933760f0 upstream.
    
    syzkaller discovered that if tls_sw_splice_eof() is executed as part of
    sendfile() when the plaintext/ciphertext sk_msg are empty, the send path
    gets confused because the empty ciphertext buffer does not have enough
    space for the encryption overhead. This causes tls_push_record() to go on
    the `split = true` path (which is only supposed to be used when interacting
    with an attached BPF program), and then get further confused and hit the
    tls_merge_open_record() path, which then assumes that there must be at
    least one populated buffer element, leading to a NULL deref.
    
    It is possible to have empty plaintext/ciphertext buffers if we previously
    bailed from tls_sw_sendmsg_locked() via the tls_trim_both_msgs() path.
    tls_sw_push_pending_record() already handles this case correctly; let's do
    the same check in tls_sw_splice_eof().

    tracing: Inform kmemleak of saved_cmdlines allocation
    
    commit 2394ac4145ea91b92271e675a09af2a9ea6840b7 upstream.
    
    The allocation of the struct saved_cmdlines_buffer structure changed from:
    
            s = kmalloc(sizeof(*s), GFP_KERNEL);
            s->saved_cmdlines = kmalloc_array(TASK_COMM_LEN, val, GFP_KERNEL);
    
    to:
    
            orig_size = sizeof(*s) + val * TASK_COMM_LEN;
            order = get_order(orig_size);
            size = 1 << (order + PAGE_SHIFT);
            page = alloc_pages(GFP_KERNEL, order);
            if (!page)
                    return NULL;
    
            s = page_address(page);
            memset(s, 0, sizeof(*s));
    
            s->saved_cmdlines = kmalloc_array(TASK_COMM_LEN, val, GFP_KERNEL);
    
    Where that s->saved_cmdlines allocation looks to be a dangling allocation
    to kmemleak. That's because kmemleak only keeps track of kmalloc()
    allocations. For allocations that use page_alloc() directly, the kmemleak
    needs to be explicitly informed about it.
    
    Add kmemleak_alloc() and kmemleak_free() around the page allocation so
    that it doesn't give the following false positive:

    fs/proc: do_task_stat: move thread_group_cputime_adjusted() outside of lock_task_sighand()
    
    commit 60f92acb60a989b14e4b744501a0df0f82ef30a3 upstream.
    
    Patch series "fs/proc: do_task_stat: use sig->stats_".
    
    do_task_stat() has the same problem as getrusage() had before "getrusage:
    use sig->stats_lock rather than lock_task_sighand()": a hard lockup.  If
    NR_CPUS threads call lock_task_sighand() at the same time and the process
    has NR_THREADS, spin_lock_irq will spin with irqs disabled O(NR_CPUS *
    NR_THREADS) time.
    
    
    This patch (of 3):
    
    thread_group_cputime() does its own locking, we can safely shift
    thread_group_cputime_adjusted() which does another for_each_thread loop
    outside of ->siglock protected section.
    
    Not only this removes for_each_thread() from the critical section with
    irqs disabled, this removes another case when stats_lock is taken with
    siglock held.  We want to remove this dependency, then we can change the
    users of stats_lock to not disable irqs.

    can: j1939: prevent deadlock by changing j1939_socks_lock to rwlock
    
    commit 6cdedc18ba7b9dacc36466e27e3267d201948c8d upstream.
    
    The following 3 locks would race against each other, causing the
    deadlock situation in the Syzbot bug report:
    
    - j1939_socks_lock
    - active_session_list_lock
    - sk_session_queue_lock
    
    A reasonable fix is to change j1939_socks_lock to an rwlock, since in
    the rare situations where a write lock is required for the linked list
    that j1939_socks_lock is protecting, the code does not attempt to
    acquire any more locks. This would break the circular lock dependency,
    where, for example, the current thread already locks j1939_socks_lock
    and attempts to acquire sk_session_queue_lock, and at the same time,
    another thread attempts to acquire j1939_socks_lock while holding
    sk_session_queue_lock.
    
    NOTE: This patch along does not fix the unregister_netdevice bug
    reported by Syzbot; instead, it solves a deadlock situation to prepare
    for one or more further patches to actually fix the Syzbot bug, which
    appears to be a reference counting problem within the j1939 codebase.

    commit 2aa0a5e65eae27dbd96faca92c84ecbf6f492d42 upstream.
    
    The TDCO calculation was done using the currently applied data bittiming,
    instead of the newly computed data bittiming, which means that the TDCO
    had an invalid value unless setting the same data bittiming twice.

    mm: hugetlb pages should not be reserved by shmat() if SHM_NORESERVE
    
    commit e656c7a9e59607d1672d85ffa9a89031876ffe67 upstream.
    
    For shared memory of type SHM_HUGETLB, hugetlb pages are reserved in
    shmget() call.  If SHM_NORESERVE flags is specified then the hugetlb pages
    are not reserved.  However when the shared memory is attached with the
    shmat() call the hugetlb pages are getting reserved incorrectly for
    SHM_HUGETLB shared memory created with SHM_NORESERVE which is a bug.
    
    -------------------------------
    Following test shows the issue.
    
    $cat shmhtb.c
    
    int main()
    {
            int shmflags = 0660 | IPC_CREAT | SHM_HUGETLB | SHM_NORESERVE;
            int shmid;
    
            shmid = shmget(SKEY, SHMSZ, shmflags);
            if (shmid < 0)
            {
                    printf("shmat: shmget() failed, %d\n", errno);
                    return 1;
            }
            printf("After shmget()\n");
            system("cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i hugepages_");
    
            shmat(shmid, NULL, 0);
            printf("\nAfter shmat()\n");
            system("cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i hugepages_");
    
            shmctl(shmid, IPC_RMID, NULL);
            return 0;
    }
    
     #sysctl -w vm.nr_hugepages=20
     #./shmhtb
    
    After shmget()
    HugePages_Total:      20
    HugePages_Free:       20
    HugePages_Rsvd:        0
    HugePages_Surp:        0
    
    After shmat()
    HugePages_Total:      20
    HugePages_Free:       20
    HugePages_Rsvd:        5 <--
    HugePages_Surp:        0
    --------------------------------
    
    Fix is to ensure that hugetlb pages are not reserved for SHM_HUGETLB shared
    memory in the shmat() call.

    fs,hugetlb: fix NULL pointer dereference in hugetlbs_fill_super
    
    commit 79d72c68c58784a3e1cd2378669d51bfd0cb7498 upstream.
    
    When configuring a hugetlb filesystem via the fsconfig() syscall, there is
    a possible NULL dereference in hugetlbfs_fill_super() caused by assigning
    NULL to ctx->hstate in hugetlbfs_parse_param() when the requested pagesize
    is non valid.
    
    E.g: Taking the following steps:
    
         fd = fsopen("hugetlbfs", FSOPEN_CLOEXEC);
         fsconfig(fd, FSCONFIG_SET_STRING, "pagesize", "1024", 0);
         fsconfig(fd, FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE, NULL, NULL, 0);
    
    Given that the requested "pagesize" is invalid, ctxt->hstate will be replaced
    with NULL, losing its previous value, and we will print an error:
    
     ...
     ...
     case Opt_pagesize:
     ps = memparse(param->string, &rest);
     ctx->hstate = h;
     if (!ctx->hstate) {
             pr_err("Unsupported page size %lu MB\n", ps / SZ_1M);
             return -EINVAL;
     }
     return 0;
     ...
     ...
    
    This is a problem because later on, we will dereference ctxt->hstate in
    hugetlbfs_fill_super()
    
     ...
     ...
     sb->s_blocksize = huge_page_size(ctx->hstate);
     ...
     ...
    
    Causing below Oops.
    
    Fix this by replacing cxt->hstate value only when then pagesize is known
    to be valid.

    ceph: prevent use-after-free in encode_cap_msg()
    
    commit cda4672da1c26835dcbd7aec2bfed954eda9b5ef upstream.
    
    In fs/ceph/caps.c, in encode_cap_msg(), "use after free" error was
    caught by KASAN at this line - 'ceph_buffer_get(arg->xattr_buf);'. This
    implies before the refcount could be increment here, it was freed.
    
    In same file, in "handle_cap_grant()" refcount is decremented by this
    line - 'ceph_buffer_put(ci->i_xattrs.blob);'. It appears that a race
    occurred and resource was freed by the latter line before the former
    line could increment it.
    
    encode_cap_msg() is called by __send_cap() and __send_cap() is called by
    ceph_check_caps() after calling __prep_cap(). __prep_cap() is where
    arg->xattr_buf is assigned to ci->i_xattrs.blob. This is the spot where
    the refcount must be increased to prevent "use after free" error.

    hv_netvsc: Register VF in netvsc_probe if NET_DEVICE_REGISTER missed
    
    commit 9cae43da9867412f8bd09aee5c8a8dc5e8dc3dc2 upstream.
    
    If hv_netvsc driver is unloaded and reloaded, the NET_DEVICE_REGISTER
    handler cannot perform VF register successfully as the register call
    is received before netvsc_probe is finished. This is because we
    register register_netdevice_notifier() very early( even before
    vmbus_driver_register()).
    To fix this, we try to register each such matching VF( if it is visible
    as a netdevice) at the end of netvsc_probe.

    s390/qeth: Fix potential loss of L3-IP@ in case of network issues
    
    commit 2fe8a236436fe40d8d26a1af8d150fc80f04ee1a upstream.
    
    Symptom:
    In case of a bad cable connection (e.g. dirty optics) a fast sequence of
    network DOWN-UP-DOWN-UP could happen. UP triggers recovery of the qeth
    interface. In case of a second DOWN while recovery is still ongoing, it
    can happen that the IP@ of a Layer3 qeth interface is lost and will not
    be recovered by the second UP.
    
    Problem:
    When registration of IP addresses with Layer 3 qeth devices fails, (e.g.
    because of bad address format) the respective IP address is deleted from
    its hash-table in the driver. If registration fails because of a ENETDOWN
    condition, the address should stay in the hashtable, so a subsequent
    recovery can restore it.
    
    3caa4af834df ("qeth: keep ip-address after LAN_OFFLINE failure")
    fixes this for registration failures during normal operation, but not
    during recovery.
    
    Solution:
    Keep L3-IP address in case of ENETDOWN in qeth_l3_recover_ip(). For
    consistency with qeth_l3_add_ip() we also keep it in case of EADDRINUSE,
    i.e. for some reason the card already/still has this address registered.

    fs: relax mount_setattr() permission checks
    
    commit 46f5ab762d048dad224436978315cbc2fa79c630 upstream.
    
    When we added mount_setattr() I added additional checks compared to the
    legacy do_reconfigure_mnt() and do_change_type() helpers used by regular
    mount(2). If that mount had a parent then verify that the caller and the
    mount namespace the mount is attached to match and if not make sure that
    it's an anonymous mount.
    
    The real rootfs falls into neither category. It is neither an anoymous
    mount because it is obviously attached to the initial mount namespace
    but it also obviously doesn't have a parent mount. So that means legacy
    mount(2) allows changing mount properties on the real rootfs but
    mount_setattr(2) blocks this. I never thought much about this but of
    course someone on this planet of earth changes properties on the real
    rootfs as can be seen in [1].
    
    Since util-linux finally switched to the new mount api in 2.39 not so
    long ago it also relies on mount_setattr() and that surfaced this issue
    when Fedora 39 finally switched to it. Fix this.

    zonefs: Improve error handling
    
    commit 14db5f64a971fce3d8ea35de4dfc7f443a3efb92 upstream.
    
    Write error handling is racy and can sometime lead to the error recovery
    path wrongly changing the inode size of a sequential zone file to an
    incorrect value  which results in garbage data being readable at the end
    of a file. There are 2 problems:
    
    1) zonefs_file_dio_write() updates a zone file write pointer offset
       after issuing a direct IO with iomap_dio_rw(). This update is done
       only if the IO succeed for synchronous direct writes. However, for
       asynchronous direct writes, the update is done without waiting for
       the IO completion so that the next asynchronous IO can be
       immediately issued. However, if an asynchronous IO completes with a
       failure right before the i_truncate_mutex lock protecting the update,
       the update may change the value of the inode write pointer offset
       that was corrected by the error path (zonefs_io_error() function).
    
    2) zonefs_io_error() is called when a read or write error occurs. This
       function executes a report zone operation using the callback function
       zonefs_io_error_cb(), which does all the error recovery handling
       based on the current zone condition, write pointer position and
       according to the mount options being used. However, depending on the
       zoned device being used, a report zone callback may be executed in a
       context that is different from the context of __zonefs_io_error(). As
       a result, zonefs_io_error_cb() may be executed without the inode
       truncate mutex lock held, which can lead to invalid error processing.
    
    Fix both problems as follows:
    - Problem 1: Perform the inode write pointer offset update before a
      direct write is issued with iomap_dio_rw(). This is safe to do as
      partial direct writes are not supported (IOMAP_DIO_PARTIAL is not
      set) and any failed IO will trigger the execution of zonefs_io_error()
      which will correct the inode write pointer offset to reflect the
      current state of the one on the device.
    - Problem 2: Change zonefs_io_error_cb() into zonefs_handle_io_error()
      and call this function directly from __zonefs_io_error() after
      obtaining the zone information using blkdev_report_zones() with a
      simple callback function that copies to a local stack variable the
      struct blk_zone obtained from the device. This ensures that error
      handling is performed holding the inode truncate mutex.
      This change also simplifies error handling for conventional zone files
      by bypassing the execution of report zones entirely. This is safe to
      do because the condition of conventional zones cannot be read-only or
      offline and conventional zone files are always fully mapped with a
      constant file size.

    irqchip/gic-v3-its: Fix GICv4.1 VPE affinity update
    
    commit af9acbfc2c4b72c378d0b9a2ee023ed01055d3e2 upstream.
    
    When updating the affinity of a VPE, the VMOVP command is currently skipped
    if the two CPUs are part of the same VPE affinity.
    
    But this is wrong, as the doorbell corresponding to this VPE is still
    delivered on the 'old' CPU, which screws up the balancing.  Furthermore,
    offlining that 'old' CPU results in doorbell interrupts generated for this
    VPE being discarded.
    
    The harsh reality is that VMOVP cannot be elided when a set_affinity()
    request occurs. It needs to be obeyed, and if an optimisation is to be
    made, it is at the point where the affinity change request is made (such as
    in KVM).
    
    Drop the VMOVP elision altogether, and only use the vpe_table_mask
    to try and stay within the same ITS affinity group if at all possible.

    irqchip/irq-brcmstb-l2: Add write memory barrier before exit
    
    commit b0344d6854d25a8b3b901c778b1728885dd99007 upstream.
    
    It was observed on Broadcom devices that use GIC v3 architecture L1
    interrupt controllers as the parent of brcmstb-l2 interrupt controllers
    that the deactivation of the parent interrupt could happen before the
    brcmstb-l2 deasserted its output. This would lead the GIC to reactivate the
    interrupt only to find that no L2 interrupt was pending. The result was a
    spurious interrupt invoking handle_bad_irq() with its associated
    messaging. While this did not create a functional problem it is a waste of
    cycles.
    
    The hazard exists because the memory mapped bus writes to the brcmstb-l2
    registers are buffered and the GIC v3 architecture uses a very efficient
    system register write to deactivate the interrupt.
    
    Add a write memory barrier prior to invoking chained_irq_exit() to
    introduce a dsb(st) on those systems to ensure the system register write
    cannot be executed until the memory mapped writes are visible to the
    system.

    When a wiphy work is queued with timer, and then again

    started again after the timer expires. This can lead,
    for example, to warnings in mac80211's offchannel code

    expected, of course. Fix this by deleting the timer at
    this point, when queuing immediately due to delay=0.

    nfp: flower: prevent re-adding mac index for bonded port
    
    commit 1a1c13303ff6d64e6f718dc8aa614e580ca8d9b4 upstream.
    
    When physical ports are reset (either through link failure or manually
    toggled down and up again) that are slaved to a Linux bond with a tunnel
    endpoint IP address on the bond device, not all tunnel packets arriving
    on the bond port are decapped as expected.
    
    The bond dev assigns the same MAC address to itself and each of its
    slaves. When toggling a slave device, the same MAC address is therefore
    offloaded to the NFP multiple times with different indexes.
    
    The issue only occurs when re-adding the shared mac. The
    nfp_tunnel_add_shared_mac() function has a conditional check early on
    that checks if a mac entry already exists and if that mac entry is
    global: (entry && nfp_tunnel_is_mac_idx_global(entry->index)). In the
    case of a bonded device (For example br-ex), the mac index is obtained,
    and no new index is assigned.
    
    We therefore modify the conditional in nfp_tunnel_add_shared_mac() to
    check if the port belongs to the LAG along with the existing checks to
    prevent a new global mac index from being re-assigned to the slave port.

    when the driver starts up, in variables 'barcfg_msix_general' and
    'barcfg_msix_xpb', respectively. The 'LengthSelect' field is ORed in
    from bit 0, which is incorrect. The 'LengthSelect' field should
    start from bit 27.
    
    This has largely gone un-noticed because
    NFP_PCIE_BAR_PCIE2CPP_LengthSelect_32BIT happens to be 0.

    nilfs2: fix hang in nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers()
    
    commit 38296afe3c6ee07319e01bb249aa4bb47c07b534 upstream.
    
    Syzbot reported a hang issue in migrate_pages_batch() called by mbind()
    and nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() called in the log writer of nilfs2.
    
    While migrate_pages_batch() locks a folio and waits for the writeback to
    complete, the log writer thread that should bring the writeback to
    completion picks up the folio being written back in
    nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() that it calls for subsequent log
    creation and was trying to lock the folio.  Thus causing a deadlock.
    
    In the first place, it is unexpected that folios/pages in the middle of
    writeback will be updated and become dirty.  Nilfs2 adds a checksum to
    verify the validity of the log being written and uses it for recovery at
    mount, so data changes during writeback are suppressed.  Since this is
    broken, an unclean shutdown could potentially cause recovery to fail.
    
    Investigation revealed that the root cause is that the wait for writeback
    completion in nilfs_page_mkwrite() is conditional, and if the backing
    device does not require stable writes, data may be modified without
    waiting.
    
    Fix these issues by making nilfs_page_mkwrite() wait for writeback to
    finish regardless of the stable write requirement of the backing device.

    nilfs2: fix data corruption in dsync block recovery for small block sizes
    
    commit 67b8bcbaed4777871bb0dcc888fb02a614a98ab1 upstream.
    
    The helper function nilfs_recovery_copy_block() of
    nilfs_recovery_dsync_blocks(), which recovers data from logs created by
    data sync writes during a mount after an unclean shutdown, incorrectly
    calculates the on-page offset when copying repair data to the file's page
    cache.  In environments where the block size is smaller than the page
    size, this flaw can cause data corruption and leak uninitialized memory
    bytes during the recovery process.
    
    Fix these issues by correcting this byte offset calculation on the page.

    io_uring/net: fix multishot accept overflow handling
    
    commit a37ee9e117ef73bbc2f5c0b31911afd52d229861 upstream.
    
    If we hit CQ ring overflow when attempting to post a multishot accept
    completion, we don't properly save the result or return code. This
    results in losing the accepted fd value.
    
    Instead, we return the result from the poll operation that triggered
    the accept retry. This is generally POLLIN|POLLPRI|POLLRDNORM|POLLRDBAND
    which is 0xc3, or 195, which looks like a valid file descriptor, but it
    really has no connection to that.
    
    Handle this like we do for other multishot completions - assign the
    result, and return IOU_STOP_MULTISHOT to cancel any further completions
    from this request when overflow is hit. This preserves the result, as we
    should, and tells the application that the request needs to be re-armed.

    x86/mm/ident_map: Use gbpages only where full GB page should be mapped.
    
    commit d794734c9bbfe22f86686dc2909c25f5ffe1a572 upstream.
    
    When ident_pud_init() uses only gbpages to create identity maps, large
    ranges of addresses not actually requested can be included in the
    resulting table; a 4K request will map a full GB.  On UV systems, this
    ends up including regions that will cause hardware to halt the system
    if accessed (these are marked "reserved" by BIOS).  Even processor
    speculation into these regions is enough to trigger the system halt.
    
    Only use gbpages when map creation requests include the full GB page
    of space.  Fall back to using smaller 2M pages when only portions of a
    GB page are included in the request.
    
    No attempt is made to coalesce mapping requests. If a request requires
    a map entry at the 2M (pmd) level, subsequent mapping requests within
    the same 1G region will also be at the pmd level, even if adjacent or
    overlapping such requests could have been combined to map a full
    gbpage.  Existing usage starts with larger regions and then adds
    smaller regions, so this should not have any great consequence.

    KVM: x86/pmu: Fix type length error when reading pmu->fixed_ctr_ctrl
    
    commit 05519c86d6997cfb9bb6c82ce1595d1015b718dc upstream.
    
    Use a u64 instead of a u8 when taking a snapshot of pmu->fixed_ctr_ctrl
    when reprogramming fixed counters, as truncating the value results in KVM
    thinking fixed counter 2 is already disabled (the bug also affects fixed
    counters 3+, but KVM doesn't yet support those).  As a result, if the
    guest disables fixed counter 2, KVM will get a false negative and fail to
    reprogram/disable emulation of the counter, which can leads to incorrect
    counts and spurious PMIs in the guest.

    x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for info to fault in xsave buffer
    
    commit d877550eaf2dc9090d782864c96939397a3c6835 upstream.
    
    Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was
    taken from fx_sw->xstate_size. fx_sw->xstate_size can be changed
    from user-space, so it is possible construct a sigreturn frame where:
    
     * fx_sw->xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
       fx_sw->xfeatures.
     * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer so that not all of
       the buffer required by xrstor is accessible.
    
    In this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area
    which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf +
    fx_sw->xstate_size is within the still mapped area, so it goes back and
    tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever.
    
    Instead, fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (taken
    from fpstate->user_size).

    x86/Kconfig: Transmeta Crusoe is CPU family 5, not 6
    
    commit f6a1892585cd19e63c4ef2334e26cd536d5b678d upstream.
    
    The kernel built with MCRUSOE is unbootable on Transmeta Crusoe.  It shows
    the following error message:
    
      This kernel requires an i686 CPU, but only detected an i586 CPU.
      Unable to boot - please use a kernel appropriate for your CPU.
    
    Remove MCRUSOE from the condition introduced in commit in Fixes, effectively
    changing X86_MINIMUM_CPU_FAMILY back to 5 on that machine, which matches the
    CPU family given by CPUID.

    powerpc/pseries: fix accuracy of stolen time
    
    commit cbecc9fcbbec60136b0180ba0609c829afed5c81 upstream.
    
    powerVM hypervisor updates the VPA fields with stolen time data.
    It currently reports enqueue_dispatch_tb and ready_enqueue_tb for
    this purpose. In linux these two fields are used to report the stolen time.
    
    The VPA fields are updated at the TB frequency. On powerPC its mostly
    set at 512Mhz. Hence this needs a conversion to ns when reporting it
    back as rest of the kernel timings are in ns. This conversion is already
    handled in tb_to_ns function. So use that function to report accurate
    stolen time.
    
    Observed this issue and used an Capped Shared Processor LPAR(SPLPAR) to
    simplify the experiments. In all these cases, 100% VP Load is run using
    stress-ng workload. Values of stolen time is in percentages as reported
    by mpstat. With the patch values are close to expected.

    powerpc/cputable: Add missing PPC_FEATURE_BOOKE on PPC64 Book-E
    
    commit eb6d871f4ba49ac8d0537e051fe983a3a4027f61 upstream.
    
    Commit e320a76db4b0 ("powerpc/cputable: Split cpu_specs[] out of
    cputable.h") moved the cpu_specs to separate header files. Previously
    PPC_FEATURE_BOOKE was enabled by CONFIG_PPC_BOOK3E_64. The definition in
    cpu_specs_e500mc.h for PPC64 no longer enables PPC_FEATURE_BOOKE.
    
    This breaks user space reading the ELF hwcaps and expect
    PPC_FEATURE_BOOKE. Debugging an application with gdb is no longer
    working on e5500/e6500 because the 64-bit detection relies on
    PPC_FEATURE_BOOKE for Book-E.

    powerpc/64: Set task pt_regs->link to the LR value on scv entry
    
    commit aad98efd0b121f63a2e1c221dcb4d4850128c697 upstream.
    
    Nysal reported that userspace backtraces are missing in offcputime bcc
    tool. As an example:
        $ sudo ./bcc/tools/offcputime.py -uU
        Tracing off-CPU time (us) of user threads by user stack... Hit Ctrl-C to end.
    
        ^C
            write
            -                python (9107)
                8
    
            write
            -                sudo (9105)
                9
    
            mmap
            -                python (9107)
                16
    
            clock_nanosleep
            -                multipathd (697)
                3001604
    
    The offcputime bcc tool attaches a bpf program to a kprobe on
    finish_task_switch(), which is usually hit on a syscall from userspace.
    With the switch to system call vectored, we started setting
    pt_regs->link to zero. This is because system call vectored behaves like
    a function call with LR pointing to the system call return address, and
    with no modification to SRR0/SRR1. The LR value does indicate our next
    instruction, so it is being saved as pt_regs->nip, and pt_regs->link is
    being set to zero. This is not a problem by itself, but BPF uses perf
    callchain infrastructure for capturing stack traces, and that stores LR
    as the second entry in the stack trace. perf has code to cope with the
    second entry being zero, and skips over it. However, generic userspace
    unwinders assume that a zero entry indicates end of the stack trace,
    resulting in a truncated userspace stack trace.
    
    Rather than fixing all userspace unwinders to ignore/skip past the
    second entry, store the real LR value in pt_regs->link so that there
    continues to be a valid, though duplicate entry in the stack trace.
    
    With this change:
        $ sudo ./bcc/tools/offcputime.py -uU
        Tracing off-CPU time (us) of user threads by user stack... Hit Ctrl-C to end.

    serial: max310x: improve crystal stable clock detection
    
    commit 93cd256ab224c2519e7c4e5f58bb4f1ac2bf0965 upstream.
    
    Some people are seeing a warning similar to this when using a crystal:
    
        max310x 11-006c: clock is not stable yet
    
    The datasheet doesn't mention the maximum time to wait for the clock to be
    stable when using a crystal, and it seems that the 10ms delay in the driver
    is not always sufficient.
    
    Jan Kundrát reported that it took three tries (each separated by 10ms) to
    get a stable clock.
    
    Modify behavior to check stable clock ready bit multiple times (20), and
    waiting 10ms between each try.
    
    Note: the first draft of the driver originally used a 50ms delay, without
    checking the clock stable bit.
    Then a loop with 1000 retries was implemented, each time reading the clock
    stable bit.

    nfp: flower: fix hardware offload for the transfer layer port
    
    commit 3a007b8009b5f8af021021b7a590a6da0dc4c6e0 upstream.
    
    The nfp driver will merge the tp source port and tp destination port
    into one dword which the offset must be zero to do hardware offload.
    However, the mangle action for the tp source port and tp destination
    port is separated for tc ct action. Modify the mangle action for the
    FLOW_ACT_MANGLE_HDR_TYPE_TCP and FLOW_ACT_MANGLE_HDR_TYPE_UDP to
    satisfy the nfp driver offload check for the tp port.
    
    The mangle action provides a 4B value for source, and a 4B value for
    the destination, but only 2B of each contains the useful information.
    For offload the 2B of each is combined into a single 4B word. Since the
    incoming mask for the source is '0xFFFF<mask>' the shift-left will
    throw away the 0xFFFF part. When this gets combined together in the
    offload it will clear the destination field. Fix this by setting the
    lower bits back to 0xFFFF, effectively doing a rotate-left operation on
    the mask.

    ring-buffer: Clean ring_buffer_poll_wait() error return
    
    commit 66bbea9ed6446b8471d365a22734dc00556c4785 upstream.
    
    The return type for ring_buffer_poll_wait() is __poll_t. This is behind
    the scenes an unsigned where we can set event bits. In case of a
    non-allocated CPU, we do return instead -EINVAL (0xffffffea). Lucky us,
    this ends up setting few error bits (EPOLLERR | EPOLLHUP | EPOLLNVAL), so
    user-space at least is aware something went wrong.
    
    Nonetheless, this is an incorrect code. Replace that -EINVAL with a

    hv_netvsc: Fix race condition between netvsc_probe and netvsc_remove
    
    commit e0526ec5360a48ad3ab2e26e802b0532302a7e11 upstream.
    
    In commit ac5047671758 ("hv_netvsc: Disable NAPI before closing the
    VMBus channel"), napi_disable was getting called for all channels,
    including all subchannels without confirming if they are enabled or not.
    
    This caused hv_netvsc getting hung at napi_disable, when netvsc_probe()
    has finished running but nvdev->subchan_work has not started yet.
    netvsc_subchan_work() -> rndis_set_subchannel() has not created the
    sub-channels and because of that netvsc_sc_open() is not running.
    netvsc_remove() calls cancel_work_sync(&nvdev->subchan_work), for which
    netvsc_subchan_work did not run.
    
    netif_napi_add() sets the bit NAPI_STATE_SCHED because it ensures NAPI
    cannot be scheduled. Then netvsc_sc_open() -> napi_enable will clear the
    NAPIF_STATE_SCHED bit, so it can be scheduled. napi_disable() does the
    opposite.
    
    Now during netvsc_device_remove(), when napi_disable is called for those
    subchannels, napi_disable gets stuck on infinite msleep.
    
    This fix addresses this problem by ensuring that napi_disable() is not
    getting called for non-enabled NAPI struct.
    But netif_napi_del() is still necessary for these non-enabled NAPI struct
    for cleanup purpose.

    commit deb110292180cd501f6fde2a0178d65fcbcabb0c upstream.
    
    [Why]
    The original picture aspect ratio in mode struct may have chance be
    overwritten with wrong aspect ratio data in create_stream_for_sink().
    It will create a different VIC output and cause HDMI compliance test
    failed.

    Preserve the original picture aspect ratio data during create the
    stream.

    drm/amd/display: Increase frame-larger-than for all display_mode_vba files
    
    commit e63e35f0164c43fbc1adb481d6604f253b9f9667 upstream.
    
    After a recent change in LLVM, allmodconfig (which has CONFIG_KCSAN=y
    and CONFIG_WERROR=y enabled) has a few new instances of
    -Wframe-larger-than for the mode support and system configuration
    functions:
    
      drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dml/dcn20/display_mode_vba_20v2.c:3393:6: error: stack frame size (2144) exceeds limit (2048) in 'dml20v2_ModeSupportAndSystemConfigurationFull' [-Werror,-Wframe-larger-than]

            |      ^
      1 error generated.
    
    Without the sanitizers enabled, there are no warnings.
    
    This was the catalyst for commit 6740ec97bcdb ("drm/amd/display:
    Increase frame warning limit with KASAN or KCSAN in dml2") and that same
    change was made to dml in commit 5b750b22530f ("drm/amd/display:
    Increase frame warning limit with KASAN or KCSAN in dml") but the
    frame_warn_flag variable was not applied to all files. Do so now to
    clear up the warnings and make all these files consistent.

    drm/msm: Wire up tlb ops
    
    commit 8c7bfd8262319fd3f127a5380f593ea76f1b88a2 upstream.
    
    The brute force iommu_flush_iotlb_all() was good enough for unmap, but
    in some cases a map operation could require removing a table pte entry
    to replace with a block entry.  This also requires tlb invalidation.
    Missing this was resulting an obscure iova fault on what should be a
    valid buffer address.
    
    Thanks to Robin Murphy for helping me understand the cause of the fault.

    xfrm: Remove inner/outer modes from input path
    
    commit 5f24f41e8ea62a6a9095f9bbafb8b3aebe265c68 upstream.
    
    The inner/outer modes were added to abstract out common code that
    were once duplicated between IPv4 and IPv6.  As time went on the
    abstractions have been removed and we are now left with empty
    shells that only contain duplicate information.  These can be
    removed one-by-one as the same information is already present
    elsewhere in the xfrm_state object.
    
    Removing them from the input path actually allows certain valid
    combinations that are currently disallowed.  In particular, when
    a transport mode SA sits beneath a tunnel mode SA that changes
    address families, at present the transport mode SA cannot have
    AF_UNSPEC as its selector because it will be erroneously be treated
    as inter-family itself even though it simply sits beneath one.
    
    This is a serious problem because you can't set the selector to
    non-AF_UNSPEC either as that will cause the selector match to
    fail as we always match selectors to the inner-most traffic.

    Just like the input-side, removing this from the output code
    makes it possible to use transport-mode SAs underneath an

    iio: commom: st_sensors: ensure proper DMA alignment
    
    commit 862cf85fef85becc55a173387527adb4f076fab0 upstream.
    
    Aligning the buffer to the L1 cache is not sufficient in some platforms
    as they might have larger cacheline sizes for caches after L1 and thus,
    we can't guarantee DMA safety.
    
    That was the whole reason to introduce IIO_DMA_MINALIGN in [1]. Do the same
    for st_sensors common buffer.
    
    While at it, moved the odr_lock before buffer_data as we definitely
    don't want any other data to share a cacheline with the buffer.

    commit 6db053cd949fcd6254cea9f2cd5d39f7bd64379c upstream.
    
    Commit 4c3577db3e4f ("Staging: iio: impedance-analyzer: Fix sparse
    warning") fixed a compiler warning, but introduced a bug that resulted
    in one of the two 16 bit IIO channels always being zero (when both are
    enabled).
    
    This is because int is 32 bits wide on most architectures and in the
    case of a little-endian machine the two most significant bytes would
    occupy the buffer for the second channel as 'val' is being passed as a
    void pointer to 'iio_push_to_buffers()'.
    
    Fix by defining 'val' as u16. Tested working on ARM64.

    tracing: Fix wasted memory in saved_cmdlines logic
    
    commit 44dc5c41b5b1267d4dd037d26afc0c4d3a568acb upstream.
    
    While looking at improving the saved_cmdlines cache I found a huge amount
    of wasted memory that should be used for the cmdlines.
    
    The tracing data saves pids during the trace. At sched switch, if a trace
    occurred, it will save the comm of the task that did the trace. This is
    saved in a "cache" that maps pids to comms and exposed to user space via
    the /sys/kernel/tracing/saved_cmdlines file. Currently it only caches by
    default 128 comms.
    
    The structure that uses this creates an array to store the pids using
    PID_MAX_DEFAULT (which is usually set to 32768). This causes the structure
    to be of the size of 131104 bytes on 64 bit machines.
    
    In hex: 131104 = 0x20020, and since the kernel allocates generic memory in
    powers of two, the kernel would allocate 0x40000 or 262144 bytes to store
    this structure. That leaves 131040 bytes of wasted space.
    
    Worse, the structure points to an allocated array to store the comm names,
    which is 16 bytes times the amount of names to save (currently 128), which
    is 2048 bytes. Instead of allocating a separate array, make the structure
    end with a variable length string and use the extra space for that.
    
    This is similar to a recommendation that Linus had made about eventfs_inode names:
    
      https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240130190355.11486-5-torvalds@linux-foundation.org/
    
    Instead of allocating a separate string array to hold the saved comms,
    have the structure end with: char saved_cmdlines[]; and round up to the
    next power of two over sizeof(struct saved_cmdline_buffers) + num_cmdlines * TASK_COMM_LEN
    It will use this extra space for the saved_cmdline portion.
    
    Now, instead of saving only 128 comms by default, by using this wasted
    space at the end of the structure it can save over 8000 comms and even
    saves space by removing the need for allocating the other array.

    ext4: avoid bb_free and bb_fragments inconsistency in mb_free_blocks()
    
    commit 2331fd4a49864e1571b4f50aa3aa1536ed6220d0 upstream.
    
    After updating bb_free in mb_free_blocks, it is possible to return without
    updating bb_fragments because the block being freed is found to have
    already been freed, which leads to inconsistency between bb_free and
    bb_fragments.
    
    Since the group may be unlocked in ext4_grp_locked_error(), this can lead
    to problems such as dividing by zero when calculating the average fragment
    length. Hence move the update of bb_free to after the block double-free
    check guarantees that the corresponding statistics are updated only after
    the core block bitmap is modified.

    ext4: fix double-free of blocks due to wrong extents moved_len
    
    commit 55583e899a5357308274601364741a83e78d6ac4 upstream.
    
    In ext4_move_extents(), moved_len is only updated when all moves are
    successfully executed, and only discards orig_inode and donor_inode
    preallocations when moved_len is not zero. When the loop fails to exit
    after successfully moving some extents, moved_len is not updated and
    remains at 0, so it does not discard the preallocations.
    
    If the moved extents overlap with the preallocated extents, the
    overlapped extents are freed twice in ext4_mb_release_inode_pa() and
    ext4_process_freed_data() (as described in commit 94d7c16cbbbd ("ext4:
    Fix double-free of blocks with EXT4_IOC_MOVE_EXT")), and bb_free is
    incremented twice. Hence when trim is executed, a zero-division bug is
    triggered in mb_update_avg_fragment_size() because bb_free is not zero
    and bb_fragments is zero.
    
    Therefore, update move_len after each extent move to avoid the issue.

    binder: signal epoll threads of self-work
    
    commit 97830f3c3088638ff90b20dfba2eb4d487bf14d7 upstream.
    
    In (e)poll mode, threads often depend on I/O events to determine when
    data is ready for consumption. Within binder, a thread may initiate a
    command via BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make use
    of epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards.
    
    It is then crucial that epoll threads are signaled via wakeup when they
    queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an
    event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands
    won't trigger a wakeup either as the thread has pending work.

    commit 397586506c3da005b9333ce5947ad01e8018a3be upstream.
    
    After the linked LLVM change, building ARCH=um defconfig results in a
    segmentation fault in modpost. Prior to commit a23e7584ecf3 ("modpost:
    unify 'sym' and 'to' in default_mismatch_handler()"), there was a
    warning:
    
      WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o(__ex_table+0x88): Section mismatch in reference to the .ltext:(unknown)
      WARNING: modpost: The relocation at __ex_table+0x88 references
      section ".ltext" which is not in the list of
      authorized sections.  If you're adding a new section
      and/or if this reference is valid, add ".ltext" to the
      list of authorized sections to jump to on fault.
      This can be achieved by adding ".ltext" to
      OTHER_TEXT_SECTIONS in scripts/mod/modpost.c.
    
    The linked LLVM change moves global objects to the '.ltext' (and
    '.ltext.*' with '-ffunction-sections') sections with '-mcmodel=large',
    which ARCH=um uses. These sections should be handled just as '.text'
    and '.text.*' are, so add them to TEXT_SECTIONS.

    um: Fix adding '-no-pie' for clang
    
    commit 846cfbeed09b45d985079a9173cf390cc053715b upstream.
    
    The kernel builds with -fno-PIE, so commit 883354afbc10 ("um: link
    vmlinux with -no-pie") added the compiler linker flag '-no-pie' via
    cc-option because '-no-pie' was only supported in GCC 6.1.0 and newer.
    
    While this works for GCC, this does not work for clang because cc-option
    uses '-c', which stops the pipeline right before linking, so '-no-pie'
    is unconsumed and clang warns, causing cc-option to fail just as it
    would if the option was entirely unsupported:

      clang-16: error: argument unused during compilation: '-no-pie' [-Werror,-Wunused-command-line-argument]
    
    A recent version of clang exposes this because it generates a relocation
    under '-mcmodel=large' that is not supported in PIE mode:
    
      /usr/sbin/ld: init/main.o: relocation R_X86_64_32 against symbol `saved_command_line' can not be used when making a PIE object; recompile with -fPIE
      /usr/sbin/ld: failed to set dynamic section sizes: bad value
      clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
    
    Remove the cc-option check altogether. It is wasteful to invoke the
    compiler to check for '-no-pie' because only one supported compiler
    version does not support it, GCC 5.x (as it is supported with the
    minimum version of clang and GCC 6.1.0+). Use a combination of the
    gcc-min-version macro and CONFIG_CC_IS_CLANG to unconditionally add
    '-no-pie' with CONFIG_LD_SCRIPT_DYN=y, so that it is enabled with all
    compilers that support this. Furthermore, using gcc-min-version can help
    turn this back into
    
      LINK-$(CONFIG_LD_SCRIPT_DYN) += -no-pie
    
    when the minimum version of GCC is bumped past 6.1.0.

    modpost: Include '.text.*' in TEXT_SECTIONS
    
    commit 19331e84c3873256537d446afec1f6c507f8c4ef upstream.
    
    Commit 6c730bfc894f ("modpost: handle -ffunction-sections") added
    ".text.*" to the OTHER_TEXT_SECTIONS macro to fix certain section
    mismatch warnings. Unfortunately, this makes it impossible for modpost
    to warn about section mismatches with LTO, which implies
    '-ffunction-sections', as all functions are put in their own
    '.text.<func_name>' sections, which may still reference functions in
    sections they are not supposed to, such as __init.
    
    Fix this by moving ".text.*" into TEXT_SECTIONS, so that configurations
    with '-ffunction-sections' will see warnings about mismatched sections.

    modpost: Don't let "driver"s reference .exit.*
    
    commit f177cd0c15fcc7bdbb68d8d1a3166dead95314c8 upstream.
    
    Drivers must not reference functions marked with __exit as these likely
    are not available when the code is built-in.
    
    There are few creative offenders uncovered for example in ARCH=amd64
    allmodconfig builds. So only trigger the section mismatch warning for
    W=1 builds.
    
    The dual rule that drivers must not reference .init.* is implemented
    since commit 0db252452378 ("modpost: don't allow *driver to reference
    .init.*") which however missed that .exit.* should be handled in the
    same way.
    
    Thanks to Masahiro Yamada and Arnd Bergmann who gave valuable hints to
    find this improvement.

    commit 20ff36856fe00879f82de71fe6f1482ca1b72334 upstream.
    
    "No build warning" is a strong requirement these days, so you must fix
    all issues before enabling a new warning flag.
    
    We often add a new warning to W=1 first so that the kbuild test robot
    blocks new breakages.
    
    This commit allows modpost to show extra warnings only when W=1
    (or KBUILD_EXTRA_WARN=1) is given.

    xen-netback: properly sync TX responses
    
    commit 7b55984c96ffe9e236eb9c82a2196e0b1f84990d upstream.
    
    Invoking the make_tx_response() / push_tx_responses() pair with no lock
    held would be acceptable only if all such invocations happened from the
    same context (NAPI instance or dealloc thread). Since this isn't the
    case, and since the interface "spec" also doesn't demand that multicast
    operations may only be performed with no in-flight transmits,
    MCAST_{ADD,DEL} processing also needs to acquire the response lock
    around the invocations.
    
    To prevent similar mistakes going forward, "downgrade" the present
    functions to private helpers of just the two remaining ones using them
    directly, with no forward declarations anymore. This involves renaming
    what so far was make_tx_response(), for the new function of that name
    to serve the new (wrapper) purpose.
    
    While there,
    - constify the txp parameters,
    - correct xenvif_idx_release()'s status parameter's type,
    - rename {,_}make_tx_response()'s status parameters for consistency with
      xenvif_idx_release()'s.

    net: hsr: remove WARN_ONCE() in send_hsr_supervision_frame()
    
    commit 37e8c97e539015637cb920d3e6f1e404f707a06e upstream.
    
    Syzkaller reported [1] hitting a warning after failing to allocate
    resources for skb in hsr_init_skb(). Since a WARN_ONCE() call will
    not help much in this case, it might be prudent to switch to
    netdev_warn_once(). At the very least it will suppress syzkaller
    reports such as [1].
    
    Just in case, use netdev_warn_once() in send_prp_supervision_frame()
    for similar reasons.

    nfc: nci: free rx_data_reassembly skb on NCI device cleanup
    
    commit bfb007aebe6bff451f7f3a4be19f4f286d0d5d9c upstream.
    
    rx_data_reassembly skb is stored during NCI data exchange for processing
    fragmented packets. It is dropped only when the last fragment is processed
    or when an NTF packet with NCI_OP_RF_DEACTIVATE_NTF opcode is received.
    However, the NCI device may be deallocated before that which leads to skb
    leak.
    
    As by design the rx_data_reassembly skb is bound to the NCI device and
    nothing prevents the device to be freed before the skb is processed in
    some way and cleaned, free it on the NCI device cleanup.
    
    Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.

    kbuild: Fix changing ELF file type for output of gen_btf for big endian
    
    commit e3a9ee963ad8ba677ca925149812c5932b49af69 upstream.
    
    Commit 90ceddcb4950 ("bpf: Support llvm-objcopy for vmlinux BTF")
    changed the ELF type of .btf.vmlinux.bin.o to ET_REL via dd, which works
    fine for little endian platforms:
    
       00000000  7f 45 4c 46 02 01 01 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |.ELF............|

      +00000010  01 00 b7 00 01 00 00 00  00 00 00 80 00 80 ff ff  |................|
    
    However, for big endian platforms, it changes the wrong byte, resulting
    in an invalid ELF file type, which ld.lld rejects:
    
       00000000  7f 45 4c 46 02 02 01 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |.ELF............|
      -00000010  00 03 00 16 00 00 00 01  00 00 00 00 00 10 00 00  |................|

      Type:                              <unknown>: 103
    
      ld.lld: error: .btf.vmlinux.bin.o: unknown file type
    
    Fix this by updating the entire 16-bit e_type field rather than just a
    single byte, so that everything works correctly for all platforms and
    linkers.
    
       00000000  7f 45 4c 46 02 02 01 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |.ELF............|
      -00000010  00 03 00 16 00 00 00 01  00 00 00 00 00 10 00 00  |................|

      Type:                              REL (Relocatable file)
    
    While in the area, update the comment to mention that binutils 2.35+
    matches LLD's behavior of rejecting an ET_EXEC input, which occurred
    after the comment was added.

    ALSA: hda/realtek: Apply headset jack quirk for non-bass alc287 thinkpads
    
    commit 2468e8922d2f6da81a6192b73023eff67e3fefdd upstream.
    
    There currently exists two thinkpad headset jack fixups:
    ALC285_FIXUP_THINKPAD_NO_BASS_SPK_HEADSET_JACK
    ALC285_FIXUP_THINKPAD_HEADSET_JACK
    
    The latter is applied to alc285 and alc287 thinkpads which contain
    bass speakers.
    However, the former was only being applied to alc285 thinkpads,
    leaving non-bass alc287 thinkpads with no headset button controls.
    This patch fixes that by adding ALC285_FIXUP_THINKPAD_NO_BASS_SPK_HEADSET_JACK
    to the alc287 chains, allowing the detection of headset buttons.

    lsm: fix the logic in security_inode_getsecctx()
    
    commit 99b817c173cd213671daecd25ca27f56b0c7c4ec upstream.
    
    The inode_getsecctx LSM hook has previously been corrected to have
    -EOPNOTSUPP instead of 0 as the default return value to fix BPF LSM
    behavior. However, the call_int_hook()-generated loop in
    security_inode_getsecctx() was left treating 0 as the neutral value, so
    after an LSM returns 0, the loop continues to try other LSMs, and if one
    of them returns a non-zero value, the function immediately returns with
    said value. So in a situation where SELinux and the BPF LSMs registered
    this hook, -EOPNOTSUPP would be incorrectly returned whenever SELinux
    returned 0.
    
    Fix this by open-coding the call_int_hook() loop and making it use the
    correct LSM_RET_DEFAULT() value as the neutral one, similar to what
    other hooks do.

    drm/virtio: Set segment size for virtio_gpu device
    
    commit 9c64e749cebd9c2d3d55261530a98bcccb83b950 upstream.
    
    Set the segment size of the virtio_gpu device to the value
    used by the drm helpers when allocating sg lists to fix the
    following complaint from DMA_API debug code:
    
    DMA-API: virtio-pci 0000:07:00.0: mapping sg segment longer than
    device claims to support [len=262144] [max=65536]

    Revert "drm/amd: flush any delayed gfxoff on suspend entry"
    
    commit 916361685319098f696b798ef1560f69ed96e934 upstream.
    
    commit ab4750332dbe ("drm/amdgpu/sdma5.2: add begin/end_use ring
    callbacks") caused GFXOFF control to be used more heavily and the
    codepath that was removed from commit 0dee72639533 ("drm/amd: flush any
    delayed gfxoff on suspend entry") now can be exercised at suspend again.
    
    Users report that by using GNOME to suspend the lockscreen trigger will
    cause SDMA traffic and the system can deadlock.
    
    This reverts commit 0dee726395333fea833eaaf838bc80962df886c8.

    This reverts commit 1a1975551943f681772720f639ff42fbaa746212.
    
    This commit causes interrupts to be lost for FCoE devices, since it changed
    sping locks from "bh" to "irqsave".
    
    Instead, a work queue should be used, and will be addressed in a separate

    commit a107d643b2a3382e0a2d2c4ef08bf8c6bff4561d upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 85d2a31fe4d9be1555f621ead7a520d8791e0f74.
    
    The rkisp1 does share interrupt lines on some platforms, after all. Thus
    we need to revert this, and implement a fix for the rkisp1 shared irq
    handling in a follow-up patch.

    commit f012d796a6de662692159c539689e47e662853a8 upstream.
    
    Before adding a new entry in mptcp_userspace_pm_get_local_id(), it's
    better to check whether this address is already in userspace pm local
    address list. If it's in the list, no need to add a new entry, just
    return it's address ID and use this address.

    mptcp: drop the push_pending field
    
    commit bdd70eb68913c960acb895b00a8c62eb64715b1f upstream.
    
    Such field is there to avoid acquiring the data lock in a few spots,
    but it adds complexity to the already non trivial locking schema.
    
    All the relevant call sites (mptcp-level re-injection, set socket
    options), are slow-path, drop such field in favor of 'cb_flags', adding
    the relevant locking.
    
    This patch could be seen as an improvement, instead of a fix. But it
    simplifies the next patch. The 'Fixes' tag has been added to help having
    this series backported to stable.

    selftests: mptcp: increase timeout to 30 min
    
    commit 4d4dfb2019d7010efb65926d9d1c1793f9a367c6 upstream.
    
    On very slow environments -- e.g. when QEmu is used without KVM --,
    mptcp_join.sh selftest can take a bit more than 20 minutes. Bump the
    default timeout by 50% as it seems normal to take that long on some
    environments.
    
    When a debug kernel config is used, this selftest will take even longer,
    but that's certainly not a common test env to consider for the timeout.
    
    The Fixes tag that has been picked here is there simply to help having
    this patch backported to older stable versions. It is difficult to point
    to the exact commit that made some env reaching the timeout from time to
    time.

    mptcp: fix data re-injection from stale subflow
    
    commit b6c620dc43ccb4e802894e54b651cf81495e9598 upstream.
    
    When the MPTCP PM detects that a subflow is stale, all the packet
    scheduler must re-inject all the mptcp-level unacked data. To avoid
    acquiring unneeded locks, it first try to check if any unacked data
    is present at all in the RTX queue, but such check is currently
    broken, as it uses TCP-specific helper on an MPTCP socket.
    
    Funnily enough fuzzers and static checkers are happy, as the accessed
    memory still belongs to the mptcp_sock struct, and even from a
    functional perspective the recovery completed successfully, as
    the short-cut test always failed.
    
    A recent unrelated TCP change - commit d5fed5addb2b ("tcp: reorganize
    tcp_sock fast path variables") - exposed the issue, as the tcp field
    reorganization makes the mptcp code always skip the re-inection.
    
    Fix the issue dropping the bogus call: we are on a slow path, the early
    optimization proved once again to be evil.

    This is a partial backport of the upstram commit 39880bd808ad ("mptcp:
    get rid of msk->subflow"). It's partial to avoid a long a complex
    dependency chain not suitable for stable.
    
    The only bit remaning from the original commit is the introduction of a
    new field avoid a race at close time causing an UaF:

    powerpc/kasan: Limit KASAN thread size increase to 32KB
    
    [ Upstream commit f1acb109505d983779bbb7e20a1ee6244d2b5736 ]
    
    KASAN is seen to increase stack usage, to the point that it was reported
    to lead to stack overflow on some 32-bit machines (see link).
    
    To avoid overflows the stack size was doubled for KASAN builds in
    commit 3e8635fb2e07 ("powerpc/kasan: Force thread size increase with
    KASAN").
    
    However with a 32KB stack size to begin with, the doubling leads to a
    64KB stack, which causes build errors:
      arch/powerpc/kernel/switch.S:249: Error: operand out of range (0x000000000000fe50 is not between 0xffffffffffff8000 and 0x0000000000007fff)
    
    Although the asm could be reworked, in practice a 32KB stack seems
    sufficient even for KASAN builds - the additional usage seems to be in
    the 2-3KB range for a 64-bit KASAN build.
    
    So only increase the stack for KASAN if the stack size is < 32KB.

    eiointc_domain_alloc() uses struct eiointc, which is not defined, for a

    i2c: qcom-geni: Correct I2C TRE sequence
    
    [ Upstream commit 83ef106fa732aea8558253641cd98e8a895604d7 ]
    
    For i2c read operation in GSI mode, we are getting timeout
    due to malformed TRE basically incorrect TRE sequence
    in gpi(drivers/dma/qcom/gpi.c) driver.
    
    I2C driver has geni_i2c_gpi(I2C_WRITE) function which generates GO TRE and
    geni_i2c_gpi(I2C_READ)generates DMA TRE. Hence to generate GO TRE before
    DMA TRE, we should move geni_i2c_gpi(I2C_WRITE) before
    geni_i2c_gpi(I2C_READ) inside the I2C GSI mode transfer function
    i.e. geni_i2c_gpi_xfer().
    
    TRE stands for Transfer Ring Element - which is basically an element with
    size of 4 words. It contains all information like slave address,
    clk divider, dma address value data size etc).
    
    Mainly we have 3 TREs(Config, GO and DMA tre).
    - CONFIG TRE : consists of internal register configuration which is
                   required before start of the transfer.
    - DMA TRE :    contains DDR/Memory address, called as DMA descriptor.
    - GO TRE :     contains Transfer directions, slave ID, Delay flags, Length
                   of the transfer.
    
    I2c driver calls GPI driver API to config each TRE depending on the
    protocol.
    
    For read operation tre sequence will be as below which is not aligned
    to hardware programming guide.
    
    - CONFIG tre
    - DMA tre
    - GO tre
    
    As per Qualcomm's internal Hardware Programming Guide, we should configure
    TREs in below sequence for any RX only transfer.
    
    - CONFIG tre
    - GO tre
    - DMA tre

    In this loop, we step through the buffer and after each item we check
    if the size_left is greater than the minimum size we need.  However,
    the problem is that "bytes_left" is type ssize_t while sizeof() is type
    size_t.  That means that because of type promotion, the comparison is
    done as an unsigned and if we have negative bytes left the loop
    continues instead of ending.

    powerpc/kasan: Fix addr error caused by page alignment
    
    [ Upstream commit 4a7aee96200ad281a5cc4cf5c7a2e2a49d2b97b0 ]
    
    In kasan_init_region, when k_start is not page aligned, at the begin of
    for loop, k_cur = k_start & PAGE_MASK is less than k_start, and then
    `va = block + k_cur - k_start` is less than block, the addr va is invalid,
    because the memory address space from va to block is not alloced by
    memblock_alloc, which will not be reserved by memblock_reserve later, it
    will be used by other places.
    
    As a result, memory overwriting occurs.
    
    for example:
    int __init __weak kasan_init_region(void *start, size_t size)
    {
    [...]
            /* if say block(dcd97000) k_start(feef7400) k_end(feeff3fe) */
            block = memblock_alloc(k_end - k_start, PAGE_SIZE);
            [...]
            for (k_cur = k_start & PAGE_MASK; k_cur < k_end; k_cur += PAGE_SIZE) {
                    /* at the begin of for loop
                     * block(dcd97000) va(dcd96c00) k_cur(feef7000) k_start(feef7400)
                     * va(dcd96c00) is less than block(dcd97000), va is invalid
                     */
                    void *va = block + k_cur - k_start;
                    [...]
            }
    [...]
    }
    
    Therefore, page alignment is performed on k_start before
    memblock_alloc() to ensure the validity of the VA address.

    driver core: fw_devlink: Improve detection of overlapping cycles
    
    [ Upstream commit 6442d79d880cf7a2fff18779265d657fef0cce4c ]
    
    fw_devlink can detect most overlapping/intersecting cycles. However it was
    missing a few corner cases because of an incorrect optimization logic that
    tries to avoid repeating cycle detection for devices that are already
    marked as part of a cycle.
    
    Here's an example provided by Xu Yang (edited for clarity):
    
                        usb
                      +-----+

      |EP|<-----------|     |
      |--+  |         |  B  |
      |     |         +-----+

      +-----+            |
         ^     +-----+   |
         |     |     |   |
         +-----|  C  |<--+
               |     |
               +-----+
               usb-phy
    
    Node A (tcpc) will be populated as device 1-0050.
    Node B (usb) will be populated as device 38100000.usb.
    Node C (usb-phy) will be populated as device 381f0040.usb-phy.
    
    The description below uses the notation:
    consumer --> supplier
    child ==> parent
    
    1. Node C is populated as device C. No cycles detected because cycle
       detection is only run when a fwnode link is converted to a device link.
    
    2. Node B is populated as device B. As we convert B --> C into a device
       link we run cycle detection and find and mark the device link/fwnode
       link cycle:
       C--> A --> B.EP ==> B --> C
    
    3. Node A is populated as device A. As we convert C --> A into a device
       link, we see it's already part of a cycle (from step 2) and don't run
       cycle detection. Thus we miss detecting the cycle:
       A --> B.EP ==> B --> A.EP ==> A
    
    Looking at it another way, A depends on B in one way:
    A --> B.EP ==> B
    
    But B depends on A in two ways and we only detect the first:
    B --> C --> A
    B --> A.EP ==> A
    
    To detect both of these, we remove the incorrect optimization attempt in
    step 3 and run cycle detection even if the fwnode link from which the
    device link is being created has already been marked as part of a cycle.

    [ Upstream commit 85e985a4f46e462a37f1875cb74ed380e7c0c2e0 ]
    
    The CO0 BCM needs to be up at all times, otherwise some hardware (like
    the UFS controller) loses its connection to the rest of the SoC,
    resulting in a hang of the platform, accompanied by a spectacular
    logspam.
    
    Mark it as keepalive to prevent such cases.

    usb: dwc3: gadget: Fix NULL pointer dereference in dwc3_gadget_suspend
    
    commit 61a348857e869432e6a920ad8ea9132e8d44c316 upstream.
    
    In current scenario if Plug-out and Plug-In performed continuously
    there could be a chance while checking for dwc->gadget_driver in
    dwc3_gadget_suspend, a NULL pointer dereference may occur.
    
    Call Stack:
    
            CPU1:                           CPU2:
            gadget_unbind_driver            dwc3_suspend_common
            dwc3_gadget_stop                dwc3_gadget_suspend
                                            dwc3_disconnect_gadget
    
    CPU1 basically clears the variable and CPU2 checks the variable.
    Consider CPU1 is running and right before gadget_driver is cleared
    and in parallel CPU2 executes dwc3_gadget_suspend where it finds
    dwc->gadget_driver which is not NULL and resumes execution and then
    CPU1 completes execution. CPU2 executes dwc3_disconnect_gadget where
    it checks dwc->gadget_driver is already NULL because of which the
    NULL pointer deference occur.

    commit b2d2d7ea0dd09802cf5a0545bf54d8ad8987d20c upstream.
    
    When write UDC to empty and unbind gadget driver from gadget device, it is
    possible that there are many queue failures for mass storage function.
    
    The root cause is mass storage main thread alaways try to queue request to
    receive a command from host if running flag is on, on platform like dwc3,
    if pull down called, it will not queue request again and return
    -ESHUTDOWN, but it not affect running flag of mass storage function.
    
    Check return code from mass storage function and clear running flag if it
    is -ESHUTDOWN, also indicate start in/out transfer failure to break loops.

    USB: hub: check for alternate port before enabling A_ALT_HNP_SUPPORT
    
    commit f17c34ffc792bbb520e4b61baa16b6cfc7d44b13 upstream.
    
    The OTG 1.3 spec has the feature A_ALT_HNP_SUPPORT, which tells
    a device that it is connected to the wrong port. Some devices
    refuse to operate if you enable that feature, because it indicates
    to them that they ought to request to be connected to another port.
    
    According to the spec this feature may be used based only the following
    three conditions:
    
    6.5.3 a_alt_hnp_support
    Setting this feature indicates to the B-device that it is connected to
    an A-device port that is not capable of HNP, but that the A-device does
    have an alternate port that is capable of HNP.
    The A-device is required to set this feature under the following conditions:
    • the A-device has multiple receptacles
    • the A-device port that connects to the B-device does not support HNP
    • the A-device has another port that does support HNP
    
    A check for the third and first condition is missing. Add it.

    usb: ucsi_acpi: Fix command completion handling
    
    commit 2840143e393a4ddc1caab4372969ea337371168c upstream.
    
    In case of a spurious or otherwise delayed notification it is
    possible that CCI still reports the previous completion. The
    UCSI spec is aware of this and provides two completion bits in
    CCI, one for normal commands and one for acks. As acks and commands
    alternate the notification handler can determine if the completion
    bit is from the current command.
    
    The initial UCSI code correctly handled this but the distinction
    between the two completion bits was lost with the introduction of
    the new API.
    
    To fix this revive the ACK_PENDING bit for ucsi_acpi and only complete
    commands if the completion bit matches.

    HID: wacom: Do not register input devices until after hid_hw_start
    
    commit c1d6708bf0d3dd976460d435373cf5abf21ce258 upstream.
    
    If a input device is opened before hid_hw_start is called, events may
    not be received from the hardware. In the case of USB-backed devices,
    for example, the hid_hw_start function is responsible for filling in
    the URB which is submitted when the input device is opened. If a device
    is opened prematurely, polling will never start because the device will
    not have been in the correct state to send the URB.
    
    Because the wacom driver registers its input devices before calling
    hid_hw_start, there is a window of time where a device can be opened
    and end up in an inoperable state. Some ARM-based Chromebooks in particular
    reliably trigger this bug.
    
    This commit splits the wacom_register_inputs function into two pieces.
    One which is responsible for setting up the allocated inputs (and runs
    prior to hid_hw_start so that devices are ready for any input events
    they may end up receiving) and another which only registers the devices
    (and runs after hid_hw_start to ensure devices can be immediately opened
    without issue). Note that the functions to initialize the LEDs and remotes
    are also moved after hid_hw_start to maintain their own dependency chains.

    HID: wacom: generic: Avoid reporting a serial of '0' to userspace
    
    commit ab41a31dd5e2681803642b6d08590b61867840ec upstream.
    
    The xf86-input-wacom driver does not treat '0' as a valid serial
    number and will drop any input report which contains an
    MSC_SERIAL = 0 event. The kernel driver already takes care to
    avoid sending any MSC_SERIAL event if the value of serial[0] == 0
    (which is the case for devices that don't actually report a
    serial number), but this is not quite sufficient.
    Only the lower 32 bits of the serial get reported to userspace,
    so if this portion of the serial is zero then there can still
    be problems.
    
    This commit allows the driver to report either the lower 32 bits
    if they are non-zero or the upper 32 bits otherwise.

    dm-crypt, dm-verity: disable tasklets
    
    commit 0a9bab391e336489169b95cb0d4553d921302189 upstream.
    
    Tasklets have an inherent problem with memory corruption. The function
    tasklet_action_common calls tasklet_trylock, then it calls the tasklet
    callback and then it calls tasklet_unlock. If the tasklet callback frees
    the structure that contains the tasklet or if it calls some code that may
    free it, tasklet_unlock will write into free memory.
    
    The commits 8e14f610159d and d9a02e016aaf try to fix it for dm-crypt, but
    it is not a sufficient fix and the data corruption can still happen [1].
    There is no fix for dm-verity and dm-verity will write into free memory
    with every tasklet-processed bio.
    
    There will be atomic workqueues implemented in the kernel 6.9 [2]. They
    will have better interface and they will not suffer from the memory
    corruption problem.
    
    But we need something that stops the memory corruption now and that can be
    backported to the stable kernels. So, I'm proposing this commit that
    disables tasklets in both dm-crypt and dm-verity. This commit doesn't
    remove the tasklet support, because the tasklet code will be reused when
    atomic workqueues will be implemented.

    Kbytes or a module parameter specified value) to encompass the one page
    ring buffer header plus the actual ring itself.  When the page size is 4K,
    carving off one page for the header isn't significant.  But when the page
    size is 64K on ARM64, only half of the default 128 Kbytes is left for the
    actual ring.  While this doesn't break anything, the smaller ring size
    could be a performance bottleneck.
    
    Fix this by applying the VMBUS_RING_SIZE macro to the specified ring buffer
    size.  This macro adds a page for the header, and rounds up the size to a
    page boundary, using the page size for which the kernel is built.  Use this
    new size for subsequent ring buffer calculations.  For example, on ARM64
    with 64K page size and the default ring size, this results in the actual
    ring being 128 Kbytes, which is intended.

    mm/writeback: fix possible divide-by-zero in wb_dirty_limits(), again
    
    commit 9319b647902cbd5cc884ac08a8a6d54ce111fc78 upstream.
    
    (struct dirty_throttle_control *)->thresh is an unsigned long, but is
    passed as the u32 divisor argument to div_u64().  On architectures where
    unsigned long is 64 bytes, the argument will be implicitly truncated.
    
    Use div64_u64() instead of div_u64() so that the value used in the "is
    this a safe division" check is the same as the divisor.
    
    Also, remove redundant cast of the numerator to u64, as that should happen
    implicitly.
    
    This would be difficult to exploit in memcg domain, given the ratio-based
    arithmetic domain_drity_limits() uses, but is much easier in global
    writeback domain with a BDI_CAP_STRICTLIMIT-backing device, using e.g.
    vm.dirty_bytes=(1<<32)*PAGE_SIZE so that dtc->thresh == (1<<32)

    i40e: Do not allow untrusted VF to remove administratively set MAC
    
    [ Upstream commit 73d9629e1c8c1982f13688c4d1019c3994647ccc ]
    
    Currently when PF administratively sets VF's MAC address and the VF
    is put down (VF tries to delete all MACs) then the MAC is removed
    from MAC filters and primary VF MAC is zeroed.
    
    Do not allow untrusted VF to remove primary MAC when it was set
    administratively by PF.
    
    Reproducer:
    1) Create VF
    2) Set VF interface up
    3) Administratively set the VF's MAC
    4) Put VF interface down

    MIPS: Add 'memory' clobber to csum_ipv6_magic() inline assembler
    
    [ Upstream commit d55347bfe4e66dce2e1e7501e5492f4af3e315f8 ]
    
    After 'lib: checksum: Use aligned accesses for ip_fast_csum and
    csum_ipv6_magic tests' was applied, the test_csum_ipv6_magic unit test
    started failing for all mips platforms, both little and bit endian.
    Oddly enough, adding debug code into test_csum_ipv6_magic() made the
    problem disappear.
    
    The gcc manual says:
    
    "The "memory" clobber tells the compiler that the assembly code performs
     memory reads or writes to items other than those listed in the input
     and output operands (for example, accessing the memory pointed to by one
     of the input parameters)
    "
    
    This is definitely the case for csum_ipv6_magic(). Indeed, adding the
    'memory' clobber fixes the problem.

    lan966x: Fix crash when adding interface under a lag
    
    [ Upstream commit 15faa1f67ab405d47789d4702f587ec7df7ef03e ]
    
    There is a crash when adding one of the lan966x interfaces under a lag
    interface. The issue can be reproduced like this:
    ip link add name bond0 type bond miimon 100 mode balance-xor
    ip link set dev eth0 master bond0
    
    The reason is because when adding a interface under the lag it would go
    through all the ports and try to figure out which other ports are under
    that lag interface. And the issue is that lan966x can have ports that are
    NULL pointer as they are not probed. So then iterating over these ports
    it would just crash as they are NULL pointers.
    The fix consists in actually checking for NULL pointers before accessing
    something from the ports. Like we do in other places.

    net: openvswitch: limit the number of recursions from action sets
    
    [ Upstream commit 6e2f90d31fe09f2b852de25125ca875aabd81367 ]
    
    The ovs module allows for some actions to recursively contain an action
    list for complex scenarios, such as sampling, checking lengths, etc.
    When these actions are copied into the internal flow table, they are
    evaluated to validate that such actions make sense, and these calls
    happen recursively.
    
    The ovs-vswitchd userspace won't emit more than 16 recursion levels
    deep.  However, the module has no such limit and will happily accept
    limits larger than 16 levels nested.  Prevent this by tracking the
    number of recursions happening and manually limiting it to 16 levels
    nested.
    
    The initial implementation of the sample action would track this depth
    and prevent more than 3 levels of recursion, but this was removed to
    support the clone use case, rather than limited at the current userspace
    limit.

    KVM: selftests: Fix a semaphore imbalance in the dirty ring logging test
    
    [ Upstream commit ba58f873cdeec30b6da48e28dd5782c5a3e1371b ]
    
    When finishing the final iteration of dirty_log_test testcase, set
    host_quit _before_ the final "continue" so that the vCPU worker doesn't
    run an extra iteration, and delete the hack-a-fix of an extra "continue"
    from the dirty ring testcase.  This fixes a bug where the extra post to
    sem_vcpu_cont may not be consumed, which results in failures in subsequent
    runs of the testcases.  The bug likely was missed during development as
    x86 supports only a single "guest mode", i.e. there aren't any subsequent
    testcases after the dirty ring test, because for_each_guest_mode() only
    runs a single iteration.
    
    For the regular dirty log testcases, letting the vCPU run one extra
    iteration is a non-issue as the vCPU worker waits on sem_vcpu_cont if and
    only if the worker is explicitly told to stop (vcpu_sync_stop_requested).
    But for the dirty ring test, which needs to periodically stop the vCPU to
    reap the dirty ring, letting the vCPU resume the guest _after_ the last
    iteration means the vCPU will get stuck without an extra "continue".
    
    However, blindly firing off an post to sem_vcpu_cont isn't guaranteed to
    be consumed, e.g. if the vCPU worker sees host_quit==true before resuming
    the guest.  This results in a dangling sem_vcpu_cont, which leads to
    subsequent iterations getting out of sync, as the vCPU worker will
    continue on before the main task is ready for it to resume the guest,
    leading to a variety of asserts, e.g.

    btrfs: don't drop extent_map for free space inode on write error
    
    commit 5571e41ec6e56e35f34ae9f5b3a335ef510e0ade upstream.

    This happens because we fail to write out the free space cache in one
    instance, come back around and attempt to write it again.  However on
    the second pass through we go to call btrfs_get_extent() on the inode to
    get the extent mapping.  Because this is a new block group, and with the
    free space inode we always search the commit root to avoid deadlocking
    with the tree, we find nothing and return a EXTENT_MAP_HOLE for the
    requested range.
    
    This happens because the first time we try to write the space cache out
    we hit an error, and on an error we drop the extent mapping.  This is
    normal for normal files, but the free space cache inode is special.  We
    always expect the extent map to be correct.  Thus the second time
    through we end up with a bogus extent map.
    
    Since we're deprecating this feature, the most straightforward way to
    fix this is to simply skip dropping the extent map range for this failed
    range.
    
    I shortened the test by using error injection to stress the area to make
    it easier to reproduce.  With this patch in place we no longer panic
    with my error injection test.

    btrfs: reject encoded write if inode has nodatasum flag set
    
    commit 1bd96c92c6a0a4d43815eb685c15aa4b78879dc9 upstream.
    
    Currently we allow an encoded write against inodes that have the NODATASUM
    flag set, either because they are NOCOW files or they were created while
    the filesystem was mounted with "-o nodatasum". This results in having
    compressed extents without corresponding checksums, which is a filesystem
    inconsistency reported by 'btrfs check'.
    
    For example, running btrfs/281 with MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o nodatacow" triggers
    this and 'btrfs check' errors out with:
    
       [1/7] checking root items
       [2/7] checking extents
       [3/7] checking free space tree
       [4/7] checking fs roots
       root 256 inode 257 errors 1040, bad file extent, some csum missing
       root 256 inode 258 errors 1040, bad file extent, some csum missing
       ERROR: errors found in fs roots
       (...)
    
    So reject encoded writes if the target inode has NODATASUM set.

    btrfs: don't reserve space for checksums when writing to nocow files
    
    commit feefe1f49d26bad9d8997096e3a200280fa7b1c5 upstream.
    
    Currently when doing a write to a file we always reserve metadata space
    for inserting data checksums. However we don't need to do it if we have
    a nodatacow file (-o nodatacow mount option or chattr +C) or if checksums
    are disabled (-o nodatasum mount option), as in that case we are only
    adding unnecessary pressure to metadata reservations.
    
    For example on x86_64, with the default node size of 16K, a 4K buffered
    write into a nodatacow file is reserving 655360 bytes of metadata space,
    as it's accounting for checksums. After this change, which stops reserving
    space for checksums if we have a nodatacow file or checksums are disabled,
    we only need to reserve 393216 bytes of metadata.

    btrfs: send: return EOPNOTSUPP on unknown flags
    
    commit f884a9f9e59206a2d41f265e7e403f080d10b493 upstream.
    
    When some ioctl flags are checked we return EOPNOTSUPP, like for
    BTRFS_SCRUB_SUPPORTED_FLAGS, BTRFS_SUBVOL_CREATE_ARGS_MASK or fallocate
    modes. The EINVAL is supposed to be for a supported but invalid
    values or combination of options. Fix that when checking send flags so
    it's consistent with the rest.

    btrfs: do not ASSERT() if the newly created subvolume already got read
    
    commit e03ee2fe873eb68c1f9ba5112fee70303ebf9dfb upstream.
    
    [BUG]
    There is a syzbot crash, triggered by the ASSERT() during subvolume
    creation:
    
     assertion failed: !anon_dev, in fs/btrfs/disk-io.c:1319
     ------------[ cut here ]------------

    [CAUSE]
    During create_subvol(), after inserting root item for the newly created
    subvolume, we would trigger btrfs_get_new_fs_root() to get the
    btrfs_root of that subvolume.
    
    The idea here is, we have preallocated an anonymous device number for
    the subvolume, thus we can assign it to the new subvolume.
    
    But there is really nothing preventing things like backref walk to read
    the new subvolume.
    If that happens before we call btrfs_get_new_fs_root(), the subvolume
    would be read out, with a new anonymous device number assigned already.
    
    In that case, we would trigger ASSERT(), as we really expect no one to
    read out that subvolume (which is not yet accessible from the fs).
    But things like backref walk is still possible to trigger the read on
    the subvolume.
    
    Thus our assumption on the ASSERT() is not correct in the first place.
    
    [FIX]
    Fix it by removing the ASSERT(), and just free the @anon_dev, reset it
    to 0, and continue.
    
    If the subvolume tree is read out by something else, it should have
    already get a new anon_dev assigned thus we only need to free the
    preallocated one.

    commit 0c309d66dacddf8ce939b891d9ead4a8e21ad6f0 upstream.
    
    Creating a qgroup 0/subvolid leads to various races and it isn't
    helpful, because you can't specify a subvol id when creating a subvol,
    so you can't be sure it will be the right one. Any requirements on the
    automatic subvol can be gratified by using a higher level qgroup and the
    inheritance parameters of subvol creation.

    btrfs: do not delete unused block group if it may be used soon
    
    commit f4a9f219411f318ae60d6ff7f129082a75686c6c upstream.
    
    Before deleting a block group that is in the list of unused block groups
    (fs_info->unused_bgs), we check if the block group became used before
    deleting it, as extents from it may have been allocated after it was added
    to the list.
    
    However even if the block group was not yet used, there may be tasks that
    have only reserved space and have not yet allocated extents, and they
    might be relying on the availability of the unused block group in order
    to allocate extents. The reservation works first by increasing the
    "bytes_may_use" field of the corresponding space_info object (which may
    first require flushing delayed items, allocating a new block group, etc),
    and only later a task does the actual allocation of extents.
    
    For metadata we usually don't end up using all reserved space, as we are
    pessimistic and typically account for the worst cases (need to COW every
    single node in a path of a tree at maximum possible height, etc). For
    data we usually reserve the exact amount of space we're going to allocate
    later, except when using compression where we always reserve space based
    on the uncompressed size, as compression is only triggered when writeback
    starts so we don't know in advance how much space we'll actually need, or
    if the data is compressible.
    
    So don't delete an unused block group if the total size of its space_info
    object minus the block group's size is less then the sum of used space and
    space that may be used (space_info->bytes_may_use), as that means we have
    tasks that reserved space and may need to allocate extents from the block
    group. In this case, besides skipping the deletion, re-add the block group
    to the list of unused block groups so that it may be reconsidered later,
    in case the tasks that reserved space end up not needing to allocate
    extents from it.
    
    Allowing the deletion of the block group while we have reserved space, can
    result in tasks failing to allocate metadata extents (-ENOSPC) while under
    a transaction handle, resulting in a transaction abort, or failure during
    writeback for the case of data extents.

    update workarounds for gcc "asm goto" issue
    
    commit 68fb3ca0e408e00db1c3f8fccdfa19e274c033be upstream.
    
    In commit 4356e9f841f7 ("work around gcc bugs with 'asm goto' with
    outputs") I did the gcc workaround unconditionally, because the cause of
    the bad code generation wasn't entirely clear.
    
    In the meantime, Jakub Jelinek debugged the issue, and has come up with
    a fix in gcc [2], which also got backported to the still maintained
    branches of gcc-11, gcc-12 and gcc-13.
    
    Note that while the fix technically wasn't in the original gcc-14
    branch, Jakub says:
    
     "while it is true that no GCC 14 snapshots until today (or whenever the
      fix will be committed) have the fix, for GCC trunk it is up to the
      distros to use the latest snapshot if they use it at all and would
      allow better testing of the kernel code without the workaround, so
      that if there are other issues they won't be discovered years later.
      Most userland code doesn't actually use asm goto with outputs..."
    
    so we will consider gcc-14 to be fixed - if somebody is using gcc
    snapshots of the gcc-14 before the fix, they should upgrade.
    
    Note that while the bug goes back to gcc-11, in practice other gcc
    changes seem to have effectively hidden it since gcc-12.1 as per a
    bisect by Jakub.  So even a gcc-14 snapshot without the fix likely
    doesn't show actual problems.
    
    Also, make the default 'asm_goto_output()' macro mark the asm as
    volatile by hand, because of an unrelated gcc issue [1] where it doesn't
    match the documented behavior ("asm goto is always volatile").

    work around gcc bugs with 'asm goto' with outputs
    
    commit 68fb3ca0e408e00db1c3f8fccdfa19e274c033be upstream.
    
    We've had issues with gcc and 'asm goto' before, and we created a
    'asm_volatile_goto()' macro for that in the past: see commits
    3f0116c3238a ("compiler/gcc4: Add quirk for 'asm goto' miscompilation
    bug") and a9f180345f53 ("compiler/gcc4: Make quirk for
    asm_volatile_goto() unconditional").
    
    Then, much later, we ended up removing the workaround in commit
    43c249ea0b1e ("compiler-gcc.h: remove ancient workaround for gcc PR
    58670") because we no longer supported building the kernel with the
    affected gcc versions, but we left the macro uses around.
    
    Now, Sean Christopherson reports a new version of a very similar
    problem, which is fixed by re-applying that ancient workaround.  But the
    problem in question is limited to only the 'asm goto with outputs'
    cases, so instead of re-introducing the old workaround as-is, let's
    rename and limit the workaround to just that much less common case.
    
    It looks like there are at least two separate issues that all hit in
    this area:
    
     (a) some versions of gcc don't mark the asm goto as 'volatile' when it
         has outputs:
    
            https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=98619
            https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=110420
    
         which is easy to work around by just adding the 'volatile' by hand.
    
     (b) Internal compiler errors:
    
            https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=110422
    
         which are worked around by adding the extra empty 'asm' as a
         barrier, as in the original workaround.
    
    but the problem Sean sees may be a third thing since it involves bad
    code generation (not an ICE) even with the manually added 'volatile'.
    
    The same old workaround works for this case, even if this feels a
    bit like voodoo programming and may only be hiding the issue.
