    net: stmmac: xgmac: use #define for string constants
    
    commit 1692b9775e745f84b69dc8ad0075b0855a43db4e upstream.
    
    The cited commit introduces and uses the string constants dpp_tx_err and
    dpp_rx_err. These are assigned to constant fields of the array
    dwxgmac3_error_desc.
    
    It has been reported that on GCC 6 and 7.5.0 this results in warnings
    such as:
    
      .../dwxgmac2_core.c:836:20: error: initialiser element is not constant
       { true, "TDPES0", dpp_tx_err },
    
    I have been able to reproduce this using: GCC 7.5.0, 8.4.0, 9.4.0 and 10.5.0.
    But not GCC 13.2.0.
    
    So it seems this effects older compilers but not newer ones.
    As Jon points out in his report, the minimum compiler supported by
    the kernel is GCC 5.1, so it does seem that this ought to be fixed.
    
    It is not clear to me what combination of 'const', if any, would address
    this problem.  So this patch takes of using #defines for the string
    constants
    
    Compile tested only.

    clocksource: Skip watchdog check for large watchdog intervals
    
    commit 644649553508b9bacf0fc7a5bdc4f9e0165576a5 upstream.
    
    There have been reports of the watchdog marking clocksources unstable on
    machines with 8 NUMA nodes:
    
      clocksource: timekeeping watchdog on CPU373:
      Marking clocksource 'tsc' as unstable because the skew is too large:
      clocksource:   'hpet' wd_nsec: 14523447520
      clocksource:   'tsc'  cs_nsec: 14524115132
    
    The measured clocksource skew - the absolute difference between cs_nsec
    and wd_nsec - was 668 microseconds:
    
      cs_nsec - wd_nsec = 14524115132 - 14523447520 = 667612
    
    The kernel used 200 microseconds for the uncertainty_margin of both the
    clocksource and watchdog, resulting in a threshold of 400 microseconds (the
    md variable). Both the cs_nsec and the wd_nsec value indicate that the
    readout interval was circa 14.5 seconds.  The observed behaviour is that
    watchdog checks failed for large readout intervals on 8 NUMA node
    machines. This indicates that the size of the skew was directly proportinal
    to the length of the readout interval on those machines. The measured
    clocksource skew, 668 microseconds, was evaluated against a threshold (the
    md variable) that is suited for readout intervals of roughly
    WATCHDOG_INTERVAL, i.e. HZ >> 1, which is 0.5 second.
    
    The intention of 2e27e793e280 ("clocksource: Reduce clocksource-skew
    threshold") was to tighten the threshold for evaluating skew and set the
    lower bound for the uncertainty_margin of clocksources to twice
    WATCHDOG_MAX_SKEW. Later in c37e85c135ce ("clocksource: Loosen clocksource
    watchdog constraints"), the WATCHDOG_MAX_SKEW constant was increased to
    125 microseconds to fit the limit of NTP, which is able to use a
    clocksource that suffers from up to 500 microseconds of skew per second.
    Both the TSC and the HPET use default uncertainty_margin. When the
    readout interval gets stretched the default uncertainty_margin is no
    longer a suitable lower bound for evaluating skew - it imposes a limit
    that is far stricter than the skew with which NTP can deal.
    
    The root causes of the skew being directly proportinal to the length of
    the readout interval are:
    
      * the inaccuracy of the shift/mult pairs of clocksources and the watchdog
      * the conversion to nanoseconds is imprecise for large readout intervals
    
    Prevent this by skipping the current watchdog check if the readout
    interval exceeds 2 * WATCHDOG_INTERVAL. Considering the maximum readout
    interval of 2 * WATCHDOG_INTERVAL, the current default uncertainty margin
    (of the TSC and HPET) corresponds to a limit on clocksource skew of 250
    ppm (microseconds of skew per second).  To keep the limit imposed by NTP
    (500 microseconds of skew per second) for all possible readout intervals,
    the margins would have to be scaled so that the threshold value is
    proportional to the length of the actual readout interval.
    
    As for why the readout interval may get stretched: Since the watchdog is
    executed in softirq context the expiration of the watchdog timer can get
    severely delayed on account of a ksoftirqd thread not getting to run in a
    timely manner. Surely, a system with such belated softirq execution is not
    working well and the scheduling issue should be looked into but the
    clocksource watchdog should be able to deal with it accordingly.

    block: treat poll queue enter similarly to timeouts
    
    commit 33391eecd63158536fb5257fee5be3a3bdc30e3c upstream.
    
    We ran into an issue where a production workload would randomly grind to
    a halt and not continue until the pending IO had timed out. This turned
    out to be a complicated interaction between queue freezing and polled
    IO:
    
    1) You have an application that does polled IO. At any point in time,
       there may be polled IO pending.
    
    2) You have a monitoring application that issues a passthrough command,
       which is marked with side effects such that it needs to freeze the
       queue.
    
    3) Passthrough command is started, which calls blk_freeze_queue_start()
       on the device. At this point the queue is marked frozen, and any
       attempt to enter the queue will fail (for non-blocking) or block.
    
    4) Now the driver calls blk_mq_freeze_queue_wait(), which will return
       when the queue is quiesced and pending IO has completed.
    
    5) The pending IO is polled IO, but any attempt to poll IO through the
       normal iocb_bio_iopoll() -> bio_poll() will fail when it gets to
       bio_queue_enter() as the queue is frozen. Rather than poll and
       complete IO, the polling threads will sit in a tight loop attempting
       to poll, but failing to enter the queue to do so.
    
    The end result is that progress for either application will be stalled
    until all pending polled IO has timed out. This causes obvious huge
    latency issues for the application doing polled IO, but also long delays
    for passthrough command.
    
    Fix this by treating queue enter for polled IO just like we do for
    timeouts. This allows quick quiesce of the queue as we still poll and
    complete this IO, while still disallowing queueing up new IO.

    f2fs: add helper to check compression level
    
    commit c571fbb5b59a3741e48014faa92c2f14bc59fe50 upstream.
    
    This patch adds a helper function to check if compression level is
    valid.
    
    Meanwhile, this patch fixes a reported issue [1]:
    
    The issue is easily reproducible by:
    
    1. dd if=/dev/zero of=test.img count=100 bs=1M
    2. mkfs.f2fs -f -O compression,extra_attr ./test.img
    3. mount -t f2fs -o compress_algorithm=zstd:6,compress_chksum,atgc,gc_merge,lazytime ./test.img /mnt
    
    resulting in
    
    [   60.789982] F2FS-fs (loop0): invalid zstd compress level: 6
    
    A bugzilla report has been submitted in
    https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=218471
    
    [1] https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/ZcWDOjKEnPDxZ0Or@google.com/T/
    
    The root cause is commit 00e120b5e4b5 ("f2fs: assign default compression
    level") tries to check low boundary of compress level w/ zstd_min_clevel(),
    however, since commit e0c1b49f5b67 ("lib: zstd: Upgrade to latest upstream
    zstd version 1.4.10"), zstd supports negative compress level, it cast type
    for negative value returned from zstd_min_clevel() to unsigned int in below
    check condition, result in repored issue.
    
            if (level < zstd_min_clevel() || ...
    
    This patch fixes this issue by casting type for level to int before
    comparison.

    io_uring/net: fix sr->len for IORING_OP_RECV with MSG_WAITALL and buffers
    
    commit 72bd80252feeb3bef8724230ee15d9f7ab541c6e upstream.
    
    If we use IORING_OP_RECV with provided buffers and pass in '0' as the
    length of the request, the length is retrieved from the selected buffer.
    If MSG_WAITALL is also set and we get a short receive, then we may hit
    the retry path which decrements sr->len and increments the buffer for
    a retry. However, the length is still zero at this point, which means
    that sr->len now becomes huge and import_ubuf() will cap it to
    MAX_RW_COUNT and subsequently return -EFAULT for the range as a whole.
    
    Fix this by always assigning sr->len once the buffer has been selected.

    Input: atkbd - skip ATKBD_CMD_SETLEDS when skipping ATKBD_CMD_GETID
    
    commit 683cd8259a9b883a51973511f860976db2550a6e upstream.
    
    After commit 936e4d49ecbc ("Input: atkbd - skip ATKBD_CMD_GETID in
    translated mode") the keyboard on Dell XPS 13 9350 / 9360 / 9370 models
    has stopped working after a suspend/resume.
    
    The problem appears to be that atkbd_probe() fails when called
    from atkbd_reconnect() on resume, which on systems where
    ATKBD_CMD_GETID is skipped can only happen by ATKBD_CMD_SETLEDS
    failing. ATKBD_CMD_SETLEDS failing because ATKBD_CMD_GETID was
    skipped is weird, but apparently that is what is happening.
    
    Fix this by also skipping ATKBD_CMD_SETLEDS when skipping
    ATKBD_CMD_GETID.

    Input: i8042 - fix strange behavior of touchpad on Clevo NS70PU
    
    commit a60e6c3918d20848906ffcdfcf72ca6a8cfbcf2e upstream.
    
    When closing the laptop lid with an external screen connected, the mouse
    pointer has a constant movement to the lower right corner. Opening the
    lid again stops this movement, but after that the touchpad does no longer
    register clicks.
    
    The touchpad is connected both via i2c-hid and PS/2, the predecessor of
    this device (NS70MU) has the same layout in this regard and also strange
    behaviour caused by the psmouse and the i2c-hid driver fighting over
    touchpad control. This fix is reusing the same workaround by just
    disabling the PS/2 aux port, that is only used by the touchpad, to give the
    i2c-hid driver the lone control over the touchpad.
    
    v2: Rebased on current master

    hrtimer: Report offline hrtimer enqueue
    
    commit dad6a09f3148257ac1773cd90934d721d68ab595 upstream.
    
    The hrtimers migration on CPU-down hotplug process has been moved
    earlier, before the CPU actually goes to die. This leaves a small window
    of opportunity to queue an hrtimer in a blind spot, leaving it ignored.
    
    For example a practical case has been reported with RCU waking up a
    SCHED_FIFO task right before the CPUHP_AP_IDLE_DEAD stage, queuing that
    way a sched/rt timer to the local offline CPU.
    
    Make sure such situations never go unnoticed and warn when that happens.

    usb: host: xhci-plat: Add support for XHCI_SG_TRB_CACHE_SIZE_QUIRK
    
    commit 520b391e3e813c1dd142d1eebb3ccfa6d08c3995 upstream.
    
    Upstream commit bac1ec551434 ("usb: xhci: Set quirk for
    XHCI_SG_TRB_CACHE_SIZE_QUIRK") introduced a new quirk in XHCI
    which fixes XHC timeout, which was seen on synopsys XHCs while
    using SG buffers. Currently this quirk can only be set using
    xhci private data. But there are some drivers like dwc3/host.c
    which adds adds quirks using software node for xhci device.
    Hence set this xhci quirk by iterating over device properties.

    usb: dwc3: host: Set XHCI_SG_TRB_CACHE_SIZE_QUIRK
    
    commit 817349b6d26aadd8b38283a05ce0bab106b4c765 upstream.
    
    Upstream commit bac1ec551434 ("usb: xhci: Set quirk for
    XHCI_SG_TRB_CACHE_SIZE_QUIRK") introduced a new quirk in XHCI
    which fixes XHC timeout, which was seen on synopsys XHCs while
    using SG buffers. But the support for this quirk isn't present
    in the DWC3 layer.
    
    We will encounter this XHCI timeout/hung issue if we run iperf
    loopback tests using RTL8156 ethernet adaptor on DWC3 targets
    with scatter-gather enabled. This gets resolved after enabling
    the XHCI_SG_TRB_CACHE_SIZE_QUIRK. This patch enables it using
    the xhci device property since its needed for DWC3 controller.
    
    In Synopsys DWC3 databook,
    Table 9-3: xHCI Debug Capability Limitations
    Chained TRBs greater than TRB cache size: The debug capability
    driver must not create a multi-TRB TD that describes smaller
    than a 1K packet that spreads across 8 or more TRBs on either
    the IN TR or the OUT TR.

    mtd: parsers: ofpart: add workaround for #size-cells 0
    
    commit 84549c816dc317f012798e706e58669b3b013604 upstream.
    
    Add a mechanism to handle the case in which partitions are present as
    direct child of the nand controller node and #size-cells is set to <0>.
    
    This could happen if the nand-controller node in the DTS is supposed to
    have #size-cells set to 0, but for some historical reason/bug it was set
    to 1 in the past, and the firmware (e.g. U-Boot) is adding the partition
    as direct children of the nand-controller defaulting to #size-cells
    being to 1.
    
    This prevents a real boot failure on colibri-imx7 that happened during v6.1
    development cycles.

    The underflow itself doesn't really affect the behavior in any meaningful
    way; however, the past timestamp may exaggerate the delay amount calculated
    later in the code, which shouldn't be a material problem given the nature of
    the delay mechanism.
    
    If @now is in the past, this CPU is racing another CPU which recently set up
    the delay and there's nothing this CPU can contribute w.r.t. the delay.
    Let's bail early from iocg_kick_delay() in such cases.

    scsi: core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock if it is for per-command
    
    [ Upstream commit 4e6c9011990726f4d175e2cdfebe5b0b8cce4839 ]
    
    Commit 4373534a9850 ("scsi: core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock
    for waking up EH handler") intended to fix a hard lockup issue triggered by
    EH. The core idea was to move scsi_host_busy() out of the host lock when
    processing individual commands for EH. However, a suggested style change
    inadvertently caused scsi_host_busy() to remain under the host lock. Fix
    this by calling scsi_host_busy() outside the lock.

    fs/ntfs3: Fix an NULL dereference bug
    
    [ Upstream commit b2dd7b953c25ffd5912dda17e980e7168bebcf6c ]
    
    The issue here is when this is called from ntfs_load_attr_list().  The
    "size" comes from le32_to_cpu(attr->res.data_size) so it can't overflow
    on a 64bit systems but on 32bit systems the "+ 1023" can overflow and
    the result is zero.  This means that the kmalloc will succeed by
    returning the ZERO_SIZE_PTR and then the memcpy() will crash with an
    Oops on the next line.

    After previous change the scratch->map member is always aligned properly

    netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: store index in scratch maps
    
    [ Upstream commit 76313d1a4aa9e30d5b43dee5efd8bcd4d8250006 ]
    
    Pipapo needs a scratchpad area to keep state during matching.
    This state can be large and thus cannot reside on stack.
    
    Each set preallocates percpu areas for this.
    
    On each match stage, one scratchpad half starts with all-zero and the other
    is inited to all-ones.
    
    At the end of each stage, the half that starts with all-ones is
    always zero.  Before next field is tested, pointers to the two halves
    are swapped, i.e.  resmap pointer turns into fill pointer and vice versa.
    
    After the last field has been processed, pipapo stashes the
    index toggle in a percpu variable, with assumption that next packet
    will start with the all-zero half and sets all bits in the other to 1.
    
    This isn't reliable.
    
    There can be multiple sets and we can't be sure that the upper
    and lower half of all set scratch map is always in sync (lookups
    can be conditional), so one set might have swapped, but other might
    not have been queried.
    
    Thus we need to keep the index per-set-and-cpu, just like the
    scratchpad.
    
    Note that this bug fix is incomplete, there is a related issue.
    
    avx2 and normal implementation might use slightly different areas of the
    map array space due to the avx2 alignment requirements, so
    m->scratch (generic/fallback implementation) and ->scratch_aligned
    (avx) may partially overlap. scratch and scratch_aligned are not distinct
    objects, the latter is just the aligned address of the former.
    
    After this change, write to scratch_align->map_index may write to
    scratch->map, so this issue becomes more prominent, we can set to 1
    a bit in the supposedly-all-zero area of scratch->map[].
    
    A followup patch will remove the scratch_aligned and makes generic and
    avx code use the same (aligned) area.
    
    Its done in a separate change to ease review.

    drm/amd/display: Implement bounds check for stream encoder creation in DCN301
    
    [ Upstream commit 58fca355ad37dcb5f785d9095db5f748b79c5dc2 ]
    
    'stream_enc_regs' array is an array of dcn10_stream_enc_registers
    structures. The array is initialized with four elements, corresponding
    to the four calls to stream_enc_regs() in the array initializer. This
    means that valid indices for this array are 0, 1, 2, and 3.
    
    The error message 'stream_enc_regs' 4 <= 5 below, is indicating that
    there is an attempt to access this array with an index of 5, which is
    out of bounds. This could lead to undefined behavior
    
    Here, eng_id is used as an index to access the stream_enc_regs array. If
    eng_id is 5, this would result in an out-of-bounds access on the
    stream_enc_regs array.
    
    Thus fixing Buffer overflow error in dcn301_stream_encoder_create
    reported by Smatch:

    cmsg_ipv6 test requests tcpdump to capture 4 packets,
    and sends until tcpdump quits. Only the first packet
    is "real", however, and the rest are basic UDP packets.
    So if tcpdump doesn't start in time it will miss
    the real packet and only capture the UDP ones.
    
    This makes the test fail on slow machine (no KVM or with
    debug enabled) 100% of the time, while it passes in fast
    environments.
    
    Repeat the "real" / expected packet.

    af_unix: Call kfree_skb() for dead unix_(sk)->oob_skb in GC.
    
    [ Upstream commit 1279f9d9dec2d7462823a18c29ad61359e0a007d ]
    
    syzbot reported a warning [0] in __unix_gc() with a repro, which
    creates a socketpair and sends one socket's fd to itself using the
    peer.
    
      socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0, [3, 4]) = 0
      sendmsg(4, {msg_name=NULL, msg_namelen=0, msg_iov=[{iov_base="\360", iov_len=1}],
              msg_iovlen=1, msg_control=[{cmsg_len=20, cmsg_level=SOL_SOCKET,
                                          cmsg_type=SCM_RIGHTS, cmsg_data=[3]}],
              msg_controllen=24, msg_flags=0}, MSG_OOB|MSG_PROBE|MSG_DONTWAIT|MSG_ZEROCOPY) = 1
    
    This forms a self-cyclic reference that GC should finally untangle
    but does not due to lack of MSG_OOB handling, resulting in memory
    leak.
    
    Recently, commit 11498715f266 ("af_unix: Remove io_uring code for
    GC.") removed io_uring's dead code in GC and revealed the problem.
    
    The code was executed at the final stage of GC and unconditionally
    moved all GC candidates from gc_candidates to gc_inflight_list.
    That papered over the reported problem by always making the following
    WARN_ON_ONCE(!list_empty(&gc_candidates)) false.
    
    The problem has been there since commit 2aab4b969002 ("af_unix: fix
    struct pid leaks in OOB support") added full scm support for MSG_OOB
    while fixing another bug.
    
    To fix this problem, we must call kfree_skb() for unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb
    if the socket still exists in gc_candidates after purging collected skb.
    
    Then, we need to set NULL to oob_skb before calling kfree_skb() because
    it calls last fput() and triggers unix_release_sock(), where we call
    duplicate kfree_skb(u->oob_skb) if not NULL.
    
    Note that the leaked socket remained being linked to a global list, so
    kmemleak also could not detect it.  We need to check /proc/net/protocol
    to notice the unfreed socket.

    The cause of this issue is that when tipc_nl_bearer_add() is called with
    the TIPC_NLA_BEARER_UDP_OPTS attribute, tipc_udp_nl_bearer_add() is called
    even if the bearer is not UDP.
    
    tipc_udp_is_known_peer() called by tipc_udp_nl_bearer_add() assumes that
    the media_ptr field of the tipc_bearer has an udp_bearer type object, so
    the function goes crazy for non-UDP bearers.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by checking the bearer type before calling
    tipc_udp_nl_bearer_add() in tipc_nl_bearer_add().

    hwmon: (coretemp) Fix bogus core_id to attr name mapping
    
    [ Upstream commit fdaf0c8629d4524a168cb9e4ad4231875749b28c ]
    
    Before commit 7108b80a542b ("hwmon/coretemp: Handle large core ID
    value"), there is a fixed mapping between
    1. cpu_core_id
    2. the index in pdata->core_data[] array
    3. the sysfs attr name, aka "tempX_"
    The later two always equal cpu_core_id + 2.
    
    After the commit, pdata->core_data[] index is got from ida so that it
    can handle sparse core ids and support more cores within a package.
    
    However, the commit erroneously maps the sysfs attr name to
    pdata->core_data[] index instead of cpu_core_id + 2.
    
    As a result, the code is not aligned with the comments, and brings user
    visible changes in hwmon sysfs on systems with sparse core id.
    
    For example, before commit 7108b80a542b ("hwmon/coretemp: Handle large
    core ID value"),
    /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/temp2_label:Core 0
    /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/temp3_label:Core 1
    /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/temp4_label:Core 2
    /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/temp5_label:Core 3
    /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/temp6_label:Core 4
    /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon3/temp10_label:Core 8
    /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon3/temp11_label:Core 9
    after commit,
    /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/temp2_label:Core 0
    /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/temp3_label:Core 1
    /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/temp4_label:Core 2
    /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/temp5_label:Core 3
    /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/temp6_label:Core 4
    /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/temp7_label:Core 8
    /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon2/temp8_label:Core 9
    
    Restore the previous behavior and rework the code, comments and variable
    names to avoid future confusions.

    selftests: net: cut more slack for gro fwd tests.
    
    [ Upstream commit cb9f4a30fb85e1f4f149ada595a67899adb3db19 ]
    
    The udpgro_fwd.sh self-tests are somewhat unstable. There are
    a few timing constraints the we struggle to meet on very slow
    environments.
    
    Instead of skipping the whole tests in such envs, increase the
    test resilience WRT very slow hosts: increase the inter-packets
    timeouts, avoid resetting the counters every second and finally
    disable reduce the background traffic noise.
    
    Tested with:
    
    for I in $(seq 1 100); do
            ./tools/testing/selftests/kselftest_install/run_kselftest.sh \
                    -t net:udpgro_fwd.sh || exit -1
    done
    
    in a slow environment.

    Function aq_ring_hwts_rx_alloc() maps extra AQ_CFG_RXDS_DEF bytes
    for PTP HWTS ring but then generic aq_ring_free() does not take this
    into account.
    Create and use a specific function to free HWTS ring to fix this

    dp_link_get_colorimetry_config() returns wrong colorimetry value

    cifs: failure to add channel on iface should bump up weight
    
    [ Upstream commit 6aac002bcfd554aff6d3ebb55e1660d078d70ab0 ]
    
    After the interface selection policy change to do a weighted
    round robin, each iface maintains a weight_fulfilled. When the
    weight_fulfilled reaches the total weight for the iface, we know
    that the weights can be reset and ifaces can be allocated from
    scratch again.
    
    During channel allocation failures on a particular channel,
    weight_fulfilled is not incremented. If a few interfaces are
    inactive, we could end up in a situation where the active
    interfaces are all allocated for the total_weight, and inactive
    ones are all that remain. This can cause a situation where
    no more channels can be allocated further.
    
    This change fixes it by increasing weight_fulfilled, even when
    channel allocation failure happens. This could mean that if
    there are temporary failures in channel allocation, the iface
    weights may not strictly be adhered to. But that's still okay.

    [ Upstream commit b73e43dcd7a8be26880ef8ff336053b29e79dbc5 ]
    
    In case of long format of qDMA command descriptor, there are one frame
    descriptor, three entries in the frame list and two data entries. So the
    size of dma_pool_create for these three fields should be the same with
    the total size of entries respectively, or the contents may be overwritten
    by the next allocated descriptor.

    This mostly reverts commit 6bd97bf273bd ("ext4: remove redundant
    mb_regenerate_buddy()") and reintroduces mb_regenerate_buddy(). Based on
    code in mb_free_blocks(), fast commit replay can end up marking as free
    blocks that are already marked as such. This causes corruption of the
    buddy bitmap so we need to regenerate it in that case.
