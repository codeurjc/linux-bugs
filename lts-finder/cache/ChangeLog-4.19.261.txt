    clk: iproc: Do not rely on node name for correct PLL setup
    
    [ Upstream commit 1b24a132eba7a1c19475ba2510ec1c00af3ff914 ]
    
    After commit 31fd9b79dc58 ("ARM: dts: BCM5301X: update CRU block
    description") a warning from clk-iproc-pll.c was generated due to a
    duplicate PLL name as well as the console stopped working. Upon closer
    inspection it became clear that iproc_pll_clk_setup() used the Device
    Tree node unit name as an unique identifier as well as a parent name to
    parent all clocks under the PLL.
    
    BCM5301X was the first platform on which that got noticed because of the
    DT node unit name renaming but the same assumptions hold true for any
    user of the iproc_pll_clk_setup() function.
    
    The first 'clock-output-names' property is always guaranteed to be
    unique as well as providing the actual desired PLL clock name, so we
    utilize that to register the PLL and as a parent name of all children
    clock.

    nvme: Fix IOC_PR_CLEAR and IOC_PR_RELEASE ioctls for nvme devices
    
    [ Upstream commit c292a337d0e45a292c301e3cd51c35aa0ae91e95 ]
    
    The IOC_PR_CLEAR and IOC_PR_RELEASE ioctls are
    non-functional on NVMe devices because the nvme_pr_clear()
    and nvme_pr_release() functions set the IEKEY field incorrectly.
    The IEKEY field should be set only when the key is zero (i.e,
    not specified).  The current code does it backwards.
    
    Furthermore, the NVMe spec describes the persistent
    reservation "clear" function as an option on the reservation
    release command. The current implementation of nvme_pr_clear()
    erroneously uses the reservation register command.
    
    Fix these errors. Note that NVMe version 1.3 and later specify
    that setting the IEKEY field will return an error of Invalid
    Field in Command.  The fix will set IEKEY when the key is zero,
    which is appropriate as these ioctls consider a zero key to
    be "unspecified", and the intention of the spec change is
    to require a valid key.
    
    Tested on a version 1.4 PCI NVMe device in an Azure VM.

    Revert "drm: bridge: analogix/dp: add panel prepare/unprepare in suspend/resume time"
    
    [ Upstream commit cc62d98bd56d45de4531844ca23913a15136c05b ]
    
    This reverts commit 211f276ed3d96e964d2d1106a198c7f4a4b3f4c0.
    
    For quite some time, core DRM helpers already ensure that any relevant
    connectors/CRTCs/etc. are disabled, as well as their associated
    components (e.g., bridges) when suspending the system. Thus,
    analogix_dp_bridge_{enable,disable}() already get called, which in turn
    call drm_panel_{prepare,unprepare}(). This makes these drm_panel_*()
    calls redundant.
    
    Besides redundancy, there are a few problems with this handling:
    
    (1) drm_panel_{prepare,unprepare}() are *not* reference-counted APIs and
    are not in general designed to be handled by multiple callers --
    although some panel drivers have a coarse 'prepared' flag that mitigates
    some damage, at least. So at a minimum this is redundant and confusing,
    but in some cases, this could be actively harmful.
    
    (2) The error-handling is a bit non-standard. We ignored errors in
    suspend(), but handled errors in resume(). And recently, people noticed
    that the clk handling is unbalanced in error paths, and getting *that*
    right is not actually trivial, given the current way errors are mostly
    ignored.
    
    (3) In the particular way analogix_dp_{suspend,resume}() get used (e.g.,
    in rockchip_dp_*(), as a late/early callback), we don't necessarily have
    a proper PM relationship between the DP/bridge device and the panel
    device. So while the DP bridge gets resumed, the panel's parent device
    (e.g., platform_device) may still be suspended, and so any prepare()
    calls may fail.
    
    So remove the superfluous, possibly-harmful suspend()/resume() handling
    of panel state.

    [ Upstream commit 49fad91a7b8941979c3e9a35f9894ac45bc5d3d6 ]
    
    Errors from debugfs are intended to be non-fatal, and should not prevent
    the driver from probing.
    
    Since debugfs file creation is treated as infallible, move it below the
    parts of the probe function that can fail. This prevents an error
    elsewhere in the probe function from causing the file to leak. Do the
    same for the call to of_platform_populate().
    
    Finally, checkpatch suggests an octal literal for the file permissions.

    This driver exports a regmap tied to the platform device (as opposed to
    a syscon, which exports a regmap tied to the OF node). Because of this,
    the driver can never be unbound, as that would destroy the regmap. Use

    ima: Free the entire rule if it fails to parse
    
    commit 2bdd737c5687d6dec30e205953146ede8a87dbdd upstream.
    
    Use ima_free_rule() to fix memory leaks of allocated ima_rule_entry

    ima: Free the entire rule when deleting a list of rules
    
    commit 465aee77aae857b5fcde56ee192b33dc369fba04 upstream.
    
    Create a function, ima_free_rule(), to free all memory associated with
    an ima_rule_entry. Use the new function to fix memory leaks of allocated
    ima_rule_entry members, such as .fsname and .keyrings, when deleting a
    list of rules.
    
    Make the existing ima_lsm_free_rule() function specific to the LSM
    audit rule array of an ima_rule_entry and require that callers make an
    additional call to kfree to free the ima_rule_entry itself.
    
    This fixes a memory leak seen when loading by a valid rule that contains
    an additional piece of allocated memory, such as an fsname, followed by
    an invalid rule that triggers a policy load failure:

    ima: Have the LSM free its audit rule
    
    commit 9ff8a616dfab96a4fa0ddd36190907dc68886d9b upstream.
    
    Ask the LSM to free its audit rule rather than directly calling kfree().
    Both AppArmor and SELinux do additional work in their audit_rule_free()
    hooks. Fix memory leaks by allowing the LSMs to perform necessary work.

    mm/migrate_device.c: flush TLB while holding PTL
    
    commit 60bae73708963de4a17231077285bd9ff2f41c44 upstream.
    
    When clearing a PTE the TLB should be flushed whilst still holding the PTL
    to avoid a potential race with madvise/munmap/etc.  For example consider
    the following sequence:
    
      CPU0                          CPU1
      ----                          ----
    
      migrate_vma_collect_pmd()
      pte_unmap_unlock()
                                    madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)
                                    -> zap_pte_range()
                                    pte_offset_map_lock()
                                    [ PTE not present, TLB not flushed ]
                                    pte_unmap_unlock()
                                    [ page is still accessible via stale TLB ]
      flush_tlb_range()
    
    In this case the page may still be accessed via the stale TLB entry after
    madvise returns.  Fix this by flushing the TLB while holding the PTL.

    mm: prevent page_frag_alloc() from corrupting the memory
    
    commit dac22531bbd4af2426c4e29e05594415ccfa365d upstream.
    
    A number of drivers call page_frag_alloc() with a fragment's size >
    PAGE_SIZE.
    
    In low memory conditions, __page_frag_cache_refill() may fail the order
    3 cache allocation and fall back to order 0; In this case, the cache
    will be smaller than the fragment, causing memory corruptions.
    
    Prevent this from happening by checking if the newly allocated cache is
    large enough for the fragment; if not, the allocation will fail and
    page_frag_alloc() will return NULL.

    mm/page_alloc: fix race condition between build_all_zonelists and page allocation
    
    commit 3d36424b3b5850bd92f3e89b953a430d7cfc88ef upstream.
    
    Patrick Daly reported the following problem;
    
            NODE_DATA(nid)->node_zonelists[ZONELIST_FALLBACK] - before offline operation
            [0] - ZONE_MOVABLE
            [1] - ZONE_NORMAL
            [2] - NULL
    
            For a GFP_KERNEL allocation, alloc_pages_slowpath() will save the
            offset of ZONE_NORMAL in ac->preferred_zoneref. If a concurrent
            memory_offline operation removes the last page from ZONE_MOVABLE,
            build_all_zonelists() & build_zonerefs_node() will update
            node_zonelists as shown below. Only populated zones are added.
    
            NODE_DATA(nid)->node_zonelists[ZONELIST_FALLBACK] - after offline operation
            [0] - ZONE_NORMAL
            [1] - NULL
            [2] - NULL
    
    The race is simple -- page allocation could be in progress when a memory
    hot-remove operation triggers a zonelist rebuild that removes zones.  The
    allocation request will still have a valid ac->preferred_zoneref that is
    now pointing to NULL and triggers an OOM kill.
    
    This problem probably always existed but may be slightly easier to trigger
    due to 6aa303defb74 ("mm, vmscan: only allocate and reclaim from zones
    with pages managed by the buddy allocator") which distinguishes between
    zones that are completely unpopulated versus zones that have valid pages
    not managed by the buddy allocator (e.g.  reserved, memblock, ballooning
    etc).  Memory hotplug had multiple stages with timing considerations
    around managed/present page updates, the zonelist rebuild and the zone
    span updates.  As David Hildenbrand puts it
    
            memory offlining adjusts managed+present pages of the zone
            essentially in one go. If after the adjustments, the zone is no
            longer populated (present==0), we rebuild the zone lists.
    
            Once that's done, we try shrinking the zone (start+spanned
            pages) -- which results in zone_start_pfn == 0 if there are no
            more pages. That happens *after* rebuilding the zonelists via
            remove_pfn_range_from_zone().
    
    The only requirement to fix the race is that a page allocation request
    identifies when a zonelist rebuild has happened since the allocation
    request started and no page has yet been allocated.  Use a seqlock_t to
    track zonelist updates with a lockless read-side of the zonelist and
    protecting the rebuild and update of the counter with a spinlock.

    mmc: moxart: fix 4-bit bus width and remove 8-bit bus width
    
    commit 35ca91d1338ae158f6dcc0de5d1e86197924ffda upstream.
    
    According to the datasheet [1] at page 377, 4-bit bus width is turned on by
    bit 2 of the Bus Width Register. Thus the current bitmask is wrong: define
    BUS_WIDTH_4 BIT(1)
    
    BIT(1) does not work but BIT(2) works. This has been verified on real MOXA
    hardware with FTSDC010 controller revision 1_6_0.
    
    The corrected value of BUS_WIDTH_4 mask collides with: define BUS_WIDTH_8
    BIT(2). Additionally, 8-bit bus width mode isn't supported according to the
    datasheet, so let's remove the corresponding code.

    libata: add ATA_HORKAGE_NOLPM for Pioneer BDR-207M and BDR-205
    
    commit ea08aec7e77bfd6599489ec430f9f859ab84575a upstream.
    
    Commit 1527f69204fe ("ata: ahci: Add Green Sardine vendor ID as
    board_ahci_mobile") added an explicit entry for AMD Green Sardine
    AHCI controller using the board_ahci_mobile configuration (this
    configuration has later been renamed to board_ahci_low_power).
    
    The board_ahci_low_power configuration enables support for low power
    modes.
    
    This explicit entry takes precedence over the generic AHCI controller
    entry, which does not enable support for low power modes.
    
    Therefore, when commit 1527f69204fe ("ata: ahci: Add Green Sardine
    vendor ID as board_ahci_mobile") was backported to stable kernels,
    it make some Pioneer optical drives, which was working perfectly fine
    before the commit was backported, stop working.
    
    The real problem is that the Pioneer optical drives do not handle low
    power modes correctly. If these optical drives would have been tested
    on another AHCI controller using the board_ahci_low_power configuration,
    this issue would have been detected earlier.
    
    Unfortunately, the board_ahci_low_power configuration is only used in
    less than 15% of the total AHCI controller entries, so many devices
    have never been tested with an AHCI controller with low power modes.

    usb-storage: Add Hiksemi USB3-FW to IGNORE_UAS
    
    commit e00b488e813f0f1ad9f778e771b7cd2fe2877023 upstream.
    
    The UAS mode of Hiksemi USB_HDD is reported to fail to work on several
    platforms with the following error message, then after re-connecting the
    device will be offlined and not working at all.

    These disks have a broken uas implementation, the tag field of the status
    iu-s is not set properly,so we need to fall-back to usb-storage.
