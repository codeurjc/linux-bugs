    After setting FSCACHE_CACHE_IS_WITHDRAWN, wait for all the cookie lookups
    to complete first, and then wait for fscache_cache->object_count == 0 to
    avoid the cookie exiting after the volume has been freed and triggering
    the above issue. Therefore call fscache_withdraw_volume() before calling
    cachefiles_withdraw_objects().
    
    This way, after setting FSCACHE_CACHE_IS_WITHDRAWN, only the following two
    cases will occur:
    1) fscache_begin_lookup fails in fscache_begin_volume_access().
    2) fscache_withdraw_volume() will ensure that fscache_count_object() has
       been executed before calling fscache_wait_for_objects().

    The fscache_volume in cache->volumes must not have been freed yet, but its
    reference count may be 0. So use the new fscache_try_get_volume() helper
    function try to get its reference count.
    
    If the reference count of fscache_volume is 0, fscache_put_volume() is
    freeing it, so wait for it to be removed from cache->volumes.
    
    If its reference count is not 0, call cachefiles_withdraw_volume() with
    reference count protection to avoid the above issue.

    wifi: mac80211: disable softirqs for queued frame handling
    
    commit 321028bc45f01edb9e57b0ae5c11c5c3600d00ca upstream.
    
    As noticed by syzbot, calling ieee80211_handle_queued_frames()
    (and actually handling frames there) requires softirqs to be
    disabled, since we call into the RX code. Fix that in the case
    of cleaning up frames left over during shutdown.

    wifi: cfg80211: wext: set ssids=NULL for passive scans
    
    commit 0941772342d59e48733131ac3a202fa1a4d832e9 upstream.
    
    In nl80211, we always set the ssids of a scan request to
    NULL when n_ssids==0 (passive scan). Drivers have relied
    on this behaviour in the past, so we fixed it in 6 GHz
    scan requests as well, and added a warning so we'd have
    assurance the API would always be called that way.
    
    syzbot found that wext doesn't ensure that, so we reach
    the check and trigger the warning. Fix the wext code to
    set the ssids pointer to NULL when there are none.

    commit 2cf6b7d15a28640117bf9f75dc050892cf78a6e8 upstream.
    
    Once again, we've broken PASEMI Nemo boards with its incomplete
    "interrupt-map" translations. Commit 935df1bd40d4 ("of/irq: Factor out
    parsing of interrupt-map parent phandle+args from of_irq_parse_raw()")
    changed the behavior resulting in the existing work-around not taking
    effect. Rework the work-around to just skip parsing "interrupt-map" up
    front by using the of_irq_imap_abusers list.

    ARM: 9324/1: fix get_user() broken with veneer
    
    commit 24d3ba0a7b44c1617c27f5045eecc4f34752ab03 upstream.
    
    The 32-bit ARM kernel stops working if the kernel grows to the point
    where veneers for __get_user_* are created.
    
    AAPCS32 [1] states, "Register r12 (IP) may be used by a linker as a
    scratch register between a routine and any subroutine it calls. It
    can also be used within a routine to hold intermediate values between
    subroutine calls."
    
    However, bl instructions buried within the inline asm are unpredictable
    for compilers; hence, "ip" must be added to the clobber list.
    
    This becomes critical when veneers for __get_user_* are created because
    veneers use the ip register since commit 02e541db0540 ("ARM: 8323/1:
    force linker to use PIC veneers").

    commit ae4ccca47195332c69176b8615c5ee17efd30c46 upstream.
    
    There are common cases where copy_file_range can noisily
    log "source and target of copy not on same server"
    e.g. the mv command across mounts to two different server's shares.
    Change this to informational rather than logging as an error.
    
    A followon patch will add dynamic trace points e.g. for
    cifs_file_copychunk_range

    selftests/vDSO: fix clang build errors and warnings
    
    [ Upstream commit 73810cd45b99c6c418e1c6a487b52c1e74edb20d ]
    
    When building with clang, via:
    
        make LLVM=1 -C tools/testing/selftests
    
    ...there are several warnings, and an error. This fixes all of those and
    allows these tests to run and pass.
    
    1. Fix linker error (undefined reference to memcpy) by providing a local
       version of memcpy.
    
    2. clang complains about using this form:
    
        if (g = h & 0xf0000000)
    
    ...so factor out the assignment into a separate step.
    
    3. The code is passing a signed const char* to elf_hash(), which expects
       a const unsigned char *. There are several callers, so fix this at
       the source by allowing the function to accept a signed argument, and
       then converting to unsigned operations, once inside the function.
    
    4. clang doesn't have __attribute__((externally_visible)) and generates
       a warning to that effect. Fortunately, gcc 12 and gcc 13 do not seem
       to require that attribute in order to build, run and pass tests here,
       so remove it.

    spi: imx: Don't expect DMA for i.MX{25,35,50,51,53} cspi devices
    
    [ Upstream commit ce1dac560a74220f2e53845ec0723b562288aed4 ]
    
    While in commit 2dd33f9cec90 ("spi: imx: support DMA for imx35") it was
    claimed that DMA works on i.MX25, i.MX31 and i.MX35 the respective
    device trees don't add DMA channels. The Reference manuals of i.MX31 and
    i.MX25 also don't mention the CSPI core being DMA capable. (I didn't
    check the others.)
    
    Since commit e267a5b3ec59 ("spi: spi-imx: Use dev_err_probe for failed
    DMA channel requests") this results in an error message
    
            spi_imx 43fa4000.spi: error -ENODEV: can't get the TX DMA channel!
    
    during boot. However that isn't fatal and the driver gets loaded just
    fine, just without using DMA.

    fs: better handle deep ancestor chains in is_subdir()
    
    [ Upstream commit 391b59b045004d5b985d033263ccba3e941a7740 ]
    
    Jan reported that 'cd ..' may take a long time in deep directory
    hierarchies under a bind-mount. If concurrent renames happen it is
    possible to livelock in is_subdir() because it will keep retrying.
    
    Change is_subdir() from simply retrying over and over to retry once and
    then acquire the rename lock to handle deep ancestor chains better. The
    list of alternatives to this approach were less then pleasant. Change
    the scope of rcu lock to cover the whole walk while at it.
    
    A big thanks to Jan and Linus. Both Jan and Linus had proposed
    effectively the same thing just that one version ended up being slightly
    more elegant.

    erofs: ensure m_llen is reset to 0 if metadata is invalid

    Sometimes, the on-disk metadata might be invalid due to user
    interrupts, storage failures, or other unknown causes.
    
    In that case, z_erofs_map_blocks_iter() may still return a valid
    m_llen while other fields remain invalid (e.g., m_plen can be 0).
    
    Due to the return value of z_erofs_scan_folio() in some path will
    be ignored on purpose, the following z_erofs_scan_folio() could
    then use the invalid value by accident.
    
    Let's reset m_llen to 0 to prevent this.

    where the former releases the sock and the latter accesses it without lock protection.

               ----                       ----

                                          l2cap_sock_recv_cb
    
    If hci_rx_work processes the data that needs to be received before the sock is
    closed, then everything is normal; Otherwise, the work thread may access the
    released sock when receiving data.
    
    Add a chan mutex in the rx callback of the sock to achieve synchronization between
    the sock release and recv cb.
    
    Sock is dead, so set chan data to NULL, avoid others use invalid sock pointer.

    hdev->req_workqueue which destroy_workqueue() needs to flush.
    
    We need to make sure that hdev->{rx_work,cmd_work,tx_work} which are
    queued into hdev->workqueue and hdev->{power_on,error_reset} which are
    queued into hdev->req_workqueue are no longer running by the moment

    scsi: libsas: Fix exp-attached device scan after probe failure scanned in again after probe failed
    
    [ Upstream commit ab2068a6fb84751836a84c26ca72b3beb349619d ]
    
    The expander phy will be treated as broadcast flutter in the next
    revalidation after the exp-attached end device probe failed, as follows:

    The cause of the problem is that the related ex_phy's attached_sas_addr was
    not cleared after the end device probe failed, so reset it.

    ALSA: dmaengine_pcm: terminate dmaengine before synchronize
    
    [ Upstream commit 6a7db25aad8ce6512b366d2ce1d0e60bac00a09d ]
    
    When dmaengine supports pause function, in suspend state,
    dmaengine_pause() is called instead of dmaengine_terminate_async(),
    
    In end of playback stream, the runtime->state will go to
    SNDRV_PCM_STATE_DRAINING, if system suspend & resume happen
    at this time, application will not resume playback stream, the
    stream will be closed directly, the dmaengine_terminate_async()
    will not be called before the dmaengine_synchronize(), which
    violates the call sequence for dmaengine_synchronize().
    
    This behavior also happens for capture streams, but there is no
    SNDRV_PCM_STATE_DRAINING state for capture. So use
    dmaengine_tx_status() to check the DMA status if the status is
    DMA_PAUSED, then call dmaengine_terminate_async() to terminate
    dmaengine before dmaengine_synchronize().

    ibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak
    
    [ Upstream commit 0983d288caf984de0202c66641577b739caad561 ]
    
    Below is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during
    transmit:
        tx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;
        free_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;
        consumer_index ++;
    Where variable data looks like this:
        free_map == [4, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, 0, 3]
                                                    consumer_index^
        tx_buff == [skb=null, skb=<ptr>, skb=<ptr>, skb=null, skb=null]
    
    The driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to
    a valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed
    to an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and
    tx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an
    skb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop
    sending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.
    
    Therefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If
    not then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be
    patched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems.

    btrfs: qgroup: fix quota root leak after quota disable failure
    
    [ Upstream commit a7e4c6a3031c74078dba7fa36239d0f4fe476c53 ]
    
    If during the quota disable we fail when cleaning the quota tree or when
    deleting the root from the root tree, we jump to the 'out' label without
    ever dropping the reference on the quota root, resulting in a leak of the
    root since fs_info->quota_root is no longer pointing to the root (we have
    set it to NULL just before those steps).
    
    Fix this by always doing a btrfs_put_root() call under the 'out' label.
    This is a problem that exists since qgroups were first added in 2012 by
    commit bed92eae26cc ("Btrfs: qgroup implementation and prototypes"), but
    back then we missed a kfree on the quota root and free_extent_buffer()
    calls on its root and commit root nodes, since back then roots were not
    yet reference counted.

    [ Upstream commit b27ea279556121b54d3f45d0529706cf100cdb3a ]
    
    On the LG Gram 16Z90S, the WMAB and WMBB ACPI methods are not mapped
    under \XINI, but instead are mapped under \_SB.XINI.
    
    The reason for this is that the LGEX0820 ACPI device used by this
    driver is mapped at \_SB.XINI, so the ACPI methods where moved as well
    to appear below the LGEX0820 ACPI device.
    
    Fix this by using the ACPI handle from the ACPI device when evaluating
    both methods.

    platform/x86: lg-laptop: Change ACPI device id
    
    [ Upstream commit 58a54f27a0dac81f7fd3514be01012635219a53c ]
    
    The LGEX0815 ACPI device id is used for handling hotkey events, but
    this functionality is already handled by the wireless-hotkey driver.
    
    The LGEX0820 ACPI device id however is used to manage various
    platform features using the WMAB/WMBB ACPI methods. Use this ACPI
    device id to avoid blocking the wireless-hotkey driver from probing.

    The rfkill hotkey handling is already provided by the wireless-hotkey

    If the ipc_prepare() callback fails for a module instance, on error rewind
    we must skip the ipc_unprepare() call for ones that has positive use count.
    
    The positive use count means that the module instance is in active use, it
    cannot be unprepared.
    
    The issue affects capture direction paths with branches (single dai with
    multiple PCMs), the affected widgets are in the shared part of the paths.

    [ Upstream commit c5dcf8ab10606e76c1d8a0ec77f27d84a392e874 ]
    
    The minimum period size was enforced to 64 as older devices integrating
    McASP with EDMA used an internal FIFO of 64 samples.
    
    With UDMA based platforms this internal McASP FIFO is optional, as the
    DMA engine internally does some buffering which is already accounted for
    when registering the platform. So we should read the actual FIFO
    configuration (txnumevt/rxnumevt) instead of hardcoding frames.min to
    64.

    [ Upstream commit e8343410ddf08fc36a9b9cc7c51a4e53a262d4c6 ]
    
    Sometimes the stream may be stopped due to XRUN events, in which case
    the userspace can call snd_pcm_drop() and snd_pcm_prepare() to stop and
    start the stream again.
    
    In these cases, we must wait for the DMA channel to synchronize before
    marking the stream as prepared for playback, as the DMA channel gets
    stopped by drop() without any synchronization. Make sure the ALSA core
    synchronizes the DMA channel by adding a sync_stop() hook.

    [ Upstream commit 0d5679a0aae2d8cda72169452c32e5cb88a7ab33 ]
    
    This is almost compatible, but passing a negative offset should result
    in a EINVAL error, but on mips o32 compat mode would seek to a large
    32-bit byte offset.
    
    Use compat_sys_lseek() to correctly sign-extend the argument.

    KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Prevent UAF in kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group()
    
    [ Upstream commit a986fa57fd81a1430e00b3c6cf8a325d6f894a63 ]
    
    Al reported a possible use-after-free (UAF) in kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group().
    
    It looks up `stt` from tablefd, but then continues to use it after doing
    fdput() on the returned fd. After the fdput() the tablefd is free to be
    closed by another thread. The close calls kvm_spapr_tce_release() and
    then release_spapr_tce_table() (via call_rcu()) which frees `stt`.
    
    Although there are calls to rcu_read_lock() in
    kvm_spapr_tce_attach_iommu_group() they are not sufficient to prevent
    the UAF, because `stt` is used outside the locked regions.
    
    With an artifcial delay after the fdput() and a userspace program which
    triggers the race, KASAN detects the UAF:

    Fix it by delaying the fdput() until `stt` is no longer in use, which
    is effectively the entire function. To keep the patch minimal add a call
    to fdput() at each of the existing return paths. Future work can convert
    the function to goto or __cleanup style cleanup.
    
    With the fix in place the test case no longer triggers the UAF.

    iomap: Fix iomap_adjust_read_range for plen calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit f5ceb1bbc98c69536d4673a97315e8427e67de1b ]
    
    If the extent spans the block that contains i_size, we need to handle
    both halves separately so that we properly zero data in the page cache
    for blocks that are entirely outside of i_size. But this is needed only
    when i_size is within the current folio under processing.
    "orig_pos + length > isize" can be true for all folios if the mapped
    extent length is greater than the folio size. That is making plen to
    break for every folio instead of only the last folio.
    
    So use orig_plen for checking if "orig_pos + orig_plen > isize".

    mei: demote client disconnect warning on suspend to debug
    
    [ Upstream commit 1db5322b7e6b58e1b304ce69a50e9dca798ca95b ]
    
    Change level for the "not connected" client message in the write
    callback from error to debug.
    
    The MEI driver currently disconnects all clients upon system suspend.
    This behavior is by design and user-space applications with
    open connections before the suspend are expected to handle errors upon
    resume, by reopening their handles, reconnecting,
    and retrying their operations.
    
    However, the current driver implementation logs an error message every
    time a write operation is attempted on a disconnected client.
    Since this is a normal and expected flow after system resume
    logging this as an error can be misleading.

    fs/file: fix the check in find_next_fd()
    
    [ Upstream commit ed8c7fbdfe117abbef81f65428ba263118ef298a ]
    
    The maximum possible return value of find_next_zero_bit(fdt->full_fds_bits,
    maxbit, bitbit) is maxbit. This return value, multiplied by BITS_PER_LONG,
    gives the value of bitbit, which can never be greater than maxfd, it can
    only be equal to maxfd at most, so the following check 'if (bitbit > maxfd)'
    will never be true.
    
    Moreover, when bitbit equals maxfd, it indicates that there are no unused
    fds, and the function can directly return.
    
    Fix this check.

    cachefiles: make on-demand read killable
    
    [ Upstream commit bc9dde6155464e906e630a0a5c17a4cab241ffbb ]
    
    Replacing wait_for_completion() with wait_for_completion_killable() in
    cachefiles_ondemand_send_req() allows us to kill processes that might
    trigger a hunk_task if the daemon is abnormal.
    
    But now only CACHEFILES_OP_READ is killable, because OP_CLOSE and OP_OPEN
    is initiated from kworker context and the signal is prohibited in these
    kworker.
    
    Note that when the req in xas changes, i.e. xas_load(&xas) != req, it
    means that a process will complete the current request soon, so wait
    again for the request to be completed.
    
    In addition, add the cachefiles_ondemand_finish_req() helper function to
    simplify the code.

    [ Upstream commit 4f8703fb3482f92edcfd31661857b16fec89c2c0 ]
    
    If copen is maliciously called in the user mode, it may delete the request
    corresponding to the random id. And the request may have not been read yet.
    
    Note that when the object is set to reopen, the open request will be done
    with the still reopen state in above case. As a result, the request
    corresponding to this object is always skipped in select_req function, so
    the read request is never completed and blocks other process.
    
    Fix this issue by simply set object to close if its id < 0 in copen.

    nfs: don't invalidate dentries on transient errors
    
    [ Upstream commit 0c8c7c559740d2d8b66048162af6c4dba8f0c88c ]
    
    This is a slight variation on a patch previously proposed by Neil Brown
    that never got merged.
    
    Prior to commit 5ceb9d7fdaaf ("NFS: Refactor nfs_lookup_revalidate()"),
    any error from nfs_lookup_verify_inode() other than -ESTALE would result
    in nfs_lookup_revalidate() returning that error (-ESTALE is mapped to
    zero).
    
    Since that commit, all errors result in nfs_lookup_revalidate()
    returning zero, resulting in dentries being invalidated where they
    previously were not (particularly in the case of -ERESTARTSYS).
    
    Fix it by passing the actual error code to nfs_lookup_revalidate_done(),
    and leaving the decision on whether to  map the error code to zero or
    one to nfs_lookup_revalidate_done().
    
    A simple reproducer is to run the following python code in a
    subdirectory of an NFS mount (not in the root of the NFS mount):
    
    ---8<---
    import os
    import multiprocessing
    import time
    
    if __name__=="__main__":
        multiprocessing.set_start_method("spawn")
    
        count = 0
        while True:
            try:
                os.getcwd()
                pool = multiprocessing.Pool(10)
                pool.close()
                pool.terminate()
                count += 1
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Failed after {count} iterations")
                print(e)
                break
    ---8<---
    
    Prior to commit 5ceb9d7fdaaf, the above code would run indefinitely.
    After commit 5ceb9d7fdaaf, it fails almost immediately with -ENOENT.

    nfs: propagate readlink errors in nfs_symlink_filler
    
    [ Upstream commit 134d0b3f2440cdddd12fc3444c9c0f62331ce6fc ]
    
    There is an inherent race where a symlink file may have been overriden
    (by a different client) between lookup and readlink, resulting in a
    spurious EIO error returned to userspace. Fix this by propagating back
    ESTALE errors such that the vfs will retry the lookup/get_link (similar
    to nfs4_file_open) at least once.

    kconfig: remove wrong expr_trans_bool()
    
    [ Upstream commit 77a92660d8fe8d29503fae768d9f5eb529c88b36 ]
    
    expr_trans_bool() performs an incorrect transformation.
    
    [Test Code]
    
        config MODULES
                def_bool y
                modules
    
        config A
                def_bool y
                select C if B != n
    
        config B
                def_tristate m
    
        config C
                tristate
    
    [Result]
    
        CONFIG_MODULES=y
        CONFIG_A=y
        CONFIG_B=m
        CONFIG_C=m
    
    This output is incorrect because CONFIG_C=y is expected.
    
    Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.rst clearly explains the function
    of the '!=' operator:
    
        If the values of both symbols are equal, it returns 'n',
        otherwise 'y'.
    
    Therefore, the statement:
    
        select C if B != n
    
    should be equivalent to:
    
        select C if y
    
    Or, more simply:
    
        select C
    
    Hence, the symbol C should be selected by the value of A, which is 'y'.
    
    However, expr_trans_bool() wrongly transforms it to:
    
        select C if B
    
    Therefore, the symbol C is selected by (A && B), which is 'm'.
    
    The comment block of expr_trans_bool() correctly explains its intention:
    
      * bool FOO!=n => FOO
        ^^^^
    
    If FOO is bool, FOO!=n can be simplified into FOO. This is correct.
    
    However, the actual code performs this transformation when FOO is
    tristate:
    
        if (e->left.sym->type == S_TRISTATE) {
                                 ^^^^^^^^^^
    
    While it can be fixed to S_BOOLEAN, there is no point in doing so
    because expr_tranform() already transforms FOO!=n to FOO when FOO is
    bool. (see the "case E_UNEQUAL" part)
    
    expr_trans_bool() is wrong and unnecessary.

    Input: silead - Always support 10 fingers
    
    [ Upstream commit 38a38f5a36da9820680d413972cb733349400532 ]
    
    When support for Silead touchscreens was orginal added some touchscreens
    with older firmware versions only supported 5 fingers and this was made
    the default requiring the setting of a "silead,max-fingers=10" uint32
    device-property for all touchscreen models which do support 10 fingers.
    
    There are very few models with the old 5 finger fw, so in practice the
    setting of the "silead,max-fingers=10" is boilerplate which needs to
    be copy and pasted to every touchscreen config.
    
    Reporting that 10 fingers are supported on devices which only support
    5 fingers doesn't cause any problems for userspace in practice, since
    at max 4 finger gestures are supported anyways. Drop the max_fingers
    configuration and simply always assume 10 fingers.

    selftests/futex: pass _GNU_SOURCE without a value to the compiler
    
    [ Upstream commit cb708ab9f584f159798b60853edcf0c8b67ce295 ]
    
    It's slightly better to set _GNU_SOURCE in the source code, but if one
    must do it via the compiler invocation, then the best way to do so is
    this:
    
        $(CC) -D_GNU_SOURCE=
    
    ...because otherwise, if this form is used:
    
        $(CC) -D_GNU_SOURCE
    
    ...then that leads the compiler to set a value, as if you had passed in:
    
        $(CC) -D_GNU_SOURCE=1
    
    That, in turn, leads to warnings under both gcc and clang, like this:
    
        futex_requeue_pi.c:20: warning: "_GNU_SOURCE" redefined
    
    Fix this by using the "-D_GNU_SOURCE=" form.

    [ Upstream commit 92ecbb3ac6f3fe8ae9edf3226c76aa17b6800699 ]

    UBSAN: array-index-out-of-bounds in net/mac80211/scan.c:372:4

    Since '__ieee80211_start_scan()' leaves 'hw_scan_req->req.n_channels'
    uninitialized, actual boundaries of 'hw_scan_req->req.channels' can't
    be checked in 'ieee80211_prep_hw_scan()'. Although an initialization
    of 'hw_scan_req->req.n_channels' introduces some confusion around
    allocated vs. used VLA members, this shouldn't be a problem since
    everything is correctly adjusted soon in 'ieee80211_prep_hw_scan()'.
    
    Cleanup 'kmalloc()' math in '__ieee80211_start_scan()' by using the
    convenient 'struct_size()' as well.

    wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: Fix scan abort handling with HW rfkill
    
    [ Upstream commit e6dd2936ce7ce94a1915b799f8af8193ec628e87 ]
    
    When HW rfkill is toggled to disable the RF, the flow to stop scan is
    called. When trying to send the command to abort the scan, since
    HW rfkill is toggled, the command is not sent due to rfkill being
    asserted, and -ERFKILL is returned from iwl_trans_send_cmd(), but this
    is silently ignored in iwl_mvm_send_cmd() and thus the scan abort flow
    continues to wait for scan complete notification and fails. Since it
    fails, the UID to type mapping is not cleared, and thus a warning is
    later fired when trying to stop the interface.
    
    To fix this, modify the UMAC scan abort flow to force sending the
    scan abort command even when in rfkill, so stop the FW from accessing
    the radio etc.

    [ Upstream commit b7ffca99313d856f7d1cc89038d9061b128e8e97 ]
    
    After moving from commands to notificaitons in the d3 resume flow,
    removing the WOWLAN_GET_STATUSES and REPLY_OFFLOADS_QUERY_CMD causes
    the return of the default value when looking up their version.
    Returning zero here results in the driver sending the not supported
    NON_QOS_TX_COUNTER_CMD.

    wifi: cfg80211: fix 6 GHz scan request building
    
    [ Upstream commit f7a8b10bfd614d7a9a16fbe80d28ead4f063cb00 ]
    
    The 6 GHz scan request struct allocated by cfg80211_scan_6ghz() is
    meant to be formed this way:
    
     [base struct][channels][ssids][6ghz_params]
    
    It is allocated with [channels] as the maximum number of channels
    supported by the driver in the 6 GHz band, since allocation is
    before knowing how many there will be.
    
    However, the inner pointers are set incorrectly: initially, the
    6 GHz scan parameters pointer is set:
    
     [base struct][channels]
                            ^ scan_6ghz_params
    
    and later the SSID pointer is set to the end of the actually
    _used_ channels.
    
     [base struct][channels]
                      ^ ssids
    
    If many APs were to be discovered, and many channels used, and
    there were many SSIDs, then the SSIDs could overlap the 6 GHz
    parameters.
    
    Additionally, the request->ssids for most of the function points
    to the original request still (given the struct copy) but is used
    normally, which is confusing.
    
    Clear this up, by actually using the allocated space for 6 GHz
    parameters _after_ the SSIDs, and set up the SSIDs initially so
    they are used more clearly. Just like in nl80211.c, set them
    only if there actually are SSIDs though.
    
    Finally, also copy the elements (ie/ie_len) so they're part of
    the same request, not pointing to the old request.

    [ Upstream commit 6f6291f09a322c1c1578badac8072d049363f4e6 ]
    
    With a ath9k device I can see that:
            iw phy phy0 interface add mesh0 type mp
            ip link set mesh0 up
            iw dev mesh0 scan
    
    Will start a scan with the Power Management bit set in the Frame Control Field.
    This is because we set this bit depending on the nonpeer_pm variable of the mesh
    iface sdata and when there are no active links on the interface it remains to
    NL80211_MESH_POWER_UNKNOWN.
    
    As soon as links starts to be established, it wil switch to
    NL80211_MESH_POWER_ACTIVE as it is the value set by befault on the per sta
    nonpeer_pm field.
    As we want no power save by default, (as expressed with the per sta ini values),
    lets init it to the expected default value of NL80211_MESH_POWER_ACTIVE.
    
    Also please note that we cannot change the default value from userspace prior to
    establishing a link as using NL80211_CMD_SET_MESH_CONFIG will not work before
    NL80211_CMD_JOIN_MESH has been issued. So too late for our initial scan.

    efi/libstub: zboot.lds: Discard .discard sections
    
    [ Upstream commit 5134acb15d9ef27aa2b90aad46d4e89fcef79fdc ]
    
    When building ARCH=loongarch defconfig + CONFIG_UNWINDER_ORC=y using
    LLVM, there is a warning from ld.lld when linking the EFI zboot image
    due to the use of unreachable() in number() in vsprintf.c:
    
      ld.lld: warning: drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/lib.a(vsprintf.stub.o):(.discard.unreachable+0x0): has non-ABS relocation R_LARCH_32_PCREL against symbol ''
    
    If the compiler cannot eliminate the default case for any reason, the
    .discard.unreachable section will remain in the final binary but the
    entire point of any section prefixed with .discard is that it is only
    used at compile time, so it can be discarded via /DISCARD/ in a linker
    script. The asm-generic vmlinux.lds.h includes .discard and .discard.*
    in the COMMON_DISCARDS macro but that is not used for zboot.lds, as it
    is not a kernel image linker script.
    
    Add .discard and .discard.* to /DISCARD/ in zboot.lds, so that any
    sections meant to be discarded at link time are not included in the
    final zboot image. This issue is not specific to LoongArch, it is just
    the first architecture to select CONFIG_OBJTOOL, which defines
    annotate_unreachable() as an asm statement to add the
    .discard.unreachable section, and use the EFI stub.

    scsi: core: alua: I/O errors for ALUA state transitions
    
    [ Upstream commit 10157b1fc1a762293381e9145041253420dfc6ad ]
    
    When a host is configured with a few LUNs and I/O is running, injecting FC
    faults repeatedly leads to path recovery problems.  The LUNs have 4 paths
    each and 3 of them come back active after say an FC fault which makes 2 of
    the paths go down, instead of all 4. This happens after several iterations
    of continuous FC faults.
    
    Reason here is that we're returning an I/O error whenever we're
    encountering sense code 06/04/0a (LOGICAL UNIT NOT ACCESSIBLE, ASYMMETRIC
    ACCESS STATE TRANSITION) instead of retrying.
    
    [mwilck: The original patch was developed by Rajashekhar M A and Hannes
    Reinecke. I moved the code to alua_check_sense() as suggested by Mike
    Christie [1]. Evan Milne had raised the question whether pg->state should
    be set to transitioning in the UA case [2]. I believe that doing this is
    correct. SCSI_ACCESS_STATE_TRANSITIONING by itself doesn't cause I/O
    errors. Our handler schedules an RTPG, which will only result in an I/O
    error condition if the transitioning timeout expires.]

    filelock: Remove locks reliably when fcntl/close race is detected
    
    commit 3cad1bc010416c6dd780643476bc59ed742436b9 upstream.
    
    When fcntl_setlk() races with close(), it removes the created lock with
    do_lock_file_wait().
    However, LSMs can allow the first do_lock_file_wait() that created the lock
    while denying the second do_lock_file_wait() that tries to remove the lock.
    In theory (but AFAIK not in practice), posix_lock_file() could also fail to
    remove a lock due to GFP_KERNEL allocation failure (when splitting a range
    in the middle).
    
    After the bug has been triggered, use-after-free reads will occur in
    lock_get_status() when userspace reads /proc/locks. This can likely be used
    to read arbitrary kernel memory, but can't corrupt kernel memory.
    This only affects systems with SELinux / Smack / AppArmor / BPF-LSM in
    enforcing mode and only works from some security contexts.
    
    Fix it by calling locks_remove_posix() instead, which is designed to
    reliably get rid of POSIX locks associated with the given file and
    files_struct and is also used by filp_flush().

    mm/damon/core: merge regions aggressively when max_nr_regions is unmet
    
    commit 310d6c15e9104c99d5d9d0ff8e5383a79da7d5e6 upstream.
    
    DAMON keeps the number of regions under max_nr_regions by skipping regions
    split operations when doing so can make the number higher than the limit.
    It works well for preventing violation of the limit.  But, if somehow the
    violation happens, it cannot recovery well depending on the situation.  In
    detail, if the real number of regions having different access pattern is
    higher than the limit, the mechanism cannot reduce the number below the
    limit.  In such a case, the system could suffer from high monitoring
    overhead of DAMON.
    
    The violation can actually happen.  For an example, the user could reduce
    max_nr_regions while DAMON is running, to be lower than the current number
    of regions.  Fix the problem by repeating the merge operations with
    increasing aggressiveness in kdamond_merge_regions() for the case, until
    the limit is met.

    minmax: relax check to allow comparison between unsigned arguments and signed constants
    
    commit 867046cc7027703f60a46339ffde91a1970f2901 upstream.
    
    Allow (for example) min(unsigned_var, 20).
    
    The opposite min(signed_var, 20u) is still errored.
    
    Since a comparison between signed and unsigned never makes the unsigned
    value negative it is only necessary to adjust the __types_ok() test.

    minmax: allow comparisons of 'int' against 'unsigned char/short'
    
    commit 4ead534fba42fc4fd41163297528d2aa731cd121 upstream.
    
    Since 'unsigned char/short' get promoted to 'signed int' it is safe to
    compare them against an 'int' value.

    minmax: allow min()/max()/clamp() if the arguments have the same signedness.
    
    commit d03eba99f5bf7cbc6e2fdde3b6fa36954ad58e09 upstream.
    
    The type-check in min()/max() is there to stop unexpected results if a
    negative value gets converted to a large unsigned value.  However it also
    rejects 'unsigned int' v 'unsigned long' compares which are common and
    never problematc.
    
    Replace the 'same type' check with a 'same signedness' check.
    
    The new test isn't itself a compile time error, so use static_assert() to
    report the error and give a meaningful error message.
    
    Due to the way builtin_choose_expr() works detecting the error in the
    'non-constant' side (where static_assert() can be used) also detects
    errors when the arguments are constant.

    minmax: clamp more efficiently by avoiding extra comparison
    
    commit 2122e2a4efc2cd139474079e11939b6e07adfacd upstream.
    
    Currently the clamp algorithm does:
    
        if (val > hi)
            val = hi;
        if (val < lo)
            val = lo;
    
    But since hi > lo by definition, this can be made more efficient with:
    
        if (val > hi)
            val = hi;
        else if (val < lo)
            val = lo;
    
    So fix up the clamp and clamp_t functions to do this, adding the same
    argument checking as for min and min_t.
    
    For simple cases, code generation on x86_64 and aarch64 stay about the
    same:
    
        before:
                cmp     edi, edx
                mov     eax, esi
                cmova   edi, edx
                cmp     edi, esi
                cmovnb  eax, edi
                ret
        after:
                cmp     edi, esi
                mov     eax, edx
                cmovnb  esi, edi
                cmp     edi, edx
                cmovb   eax, esi
                ret
    
        before:
                cmp     w0, w2
                csel    w8, w0, w2, lo
                cmp     w8, w1
                csel    w0, w8, w1, hi
                ret
        after:
                cmp     w0, w1
                csel    w8, w0, w1, hi
                cmp     w0, w2
                csel    w0, w8, w2, lo
                ret
    
    On MIPS64, however, code generation improves, by removing arithmetic in
    the second branch:
    
        before:
                sltu    $3,$6,$4
                bne     $3,$0,.L2
                move    $2,$6
    
                move    $2,$4
        .L2:
                sltu    $3,$2,$5
                bnel    $3,$0,.L7
                move    $2,$5
    
        .L7:
                jr      $31
                nop
        after:
                sltu    $3,$4,$6
                beq     $3,$0,.L13
                move    $2,$6
    
                sltu    $3,$4,$5
                bne     $3,$0,.L12
                move    $2,$4
    
        .L13:
                jr      $31
                nop
    
        .L12:
                jr      $31
                move    $2,$5
    
    For more complex cases with surrounding code, the effects are a bit
    more complicated. For example, consider this simplified version of
    timestamp_truncate() from fs/inode.c on x86_64:
    
        struct timespec64 timestamp_truncate(struct timespec64 t, struct inode *inode)
        {
            struct super_block *sb = inode->i_sb;
            unsigned int gran = sb->s_time_gran;
    
            t.tv_sec = clamp(t.tv_sec, sb->s_time_min, sb->s_time_max);
            if (t.tv_sec == sb->s_time_max || t.tv_sec == sb->s_time_min)
                t.tv_nsec = 0;
            return t;
        }
    
        before:
                mov     r8, rdx
                mov     rdx, rsi
                mov     rcx, QWORD PTR [r8]
                mov     rax, QWORD PTR [rcx+8]
                mov     rcx, QWORD PTR [rcx+16]
                cmp     rax, rdi
                mov     r8, rcx
                cmovge  rdi, rax
                cmp     rdi, rcx
                cmovle  r8, rdi
                cmp     rax, r8
                je      .L4
                cmp     rdi, rcx
                jge     .L4
                mov     rax, r8
                ret
        .L4:
                xor     edx, edx
                mov     rax, r8
                ret
    
        after:
                mov     rax, QWORD PTR [rdx]
                mov     rdx, QWORD PTR [rax+8]
                mov     rax, QWORD PTR [rax+16]
                cmp     rax, rdi
                jg      .L6
                mov     r8, rax
                xor     edx, edx
        .L2:
                mov     rax, r8
                ret
        .L6:
                cmp     rdx, rdi
                mov     r8, rdi
                cmovge  r8, rdx
                cmp     rax, r8
                je      .L4
                xor     eax, eax
                cmp     rdx, rdi
                cmovl   rax, rsi
                mov     rdx, rax
                mov     rax, r8
                ret
        .L4:
                xor     edx, edx
                jmp     .L2
    
    In this case, we actually gain a branch, unfortunately, because the
    compiler's replacement axioms no longer as cleanly apply.
    
    So all and all, this change is a bit of a mixed bag.

    minmax: sanity check constant bounds when clamping
    
    commit 5efcecd9a3b18078d3398b359a84c83f549e22cf upstream.
    
    The clamp family of functions only makes sense if hi>=lo.  If hi and lo
    are compile-time constants, then raise a build error.  Doing so has
    already caught buggy code.  This also introduces the infrastructure to
    improve the clamping function in subsequent commits.
