    uaccess: Add speculation barrier to copy_from_user()
    
    commit 74e19ef0ff8061ef55957c3abd71614ef0f42f47 upstream.
    
    The results of "access_ok()" can be mis-speculated.  The result is that
    you can end speculatively:
    
            if (access_ok(from, size))
                    // Right here
    
    even for bad from/size combinations.  On first glance, it would be ideal
    to just add a speculation barrier to "access_ok()" so that its results
    can never be mis-speculated.
    
    But there are lots of system calls just doing access_ok() via
    "copy_to_user()" and friends (example: fstat() and friends).  Those are
    generally not problematic because they do not _consume_ data from
    userspace other than the pointer.  They are also very quick and common
    system calls that should not be needlessly slowed down.
    
    "copy_from_user()" on the other hand uses a user-controller pointer and
    is frequently followed up with code that might affect caches.  Take
    something like this:
    
            if (!copy_from_user(&kernelvar, uptr, size))
                    do_something_with(kernelvar);
    
    If userspace passes in an evil 'uptr' that *actually* points to a kernel
    addresses, and then do_something_with() has cache (or other)
    side-effects, it could allow userspace to infer kernel data values.
    
    Add a barrier to the common copy_from_user() code to prevent
    mis-speculated values which happen after the copy.
    
    Also add a stub for architectures that do not define barrier_nospec().
    This makes the macro usable in generic code.
    
    Since the barrier is now usable in generic code, the x86 #ifdef in the
    BPF code can also go away.

    alarmtimer: Prevent starvation by small intervals and SIG_IGN
    
    commit d125d1349abeb46945dc5e98f7824bf688266f13 upstream.
    
    syzbot reported a RCU stall which is caused by setting up an alarmtimer
    with a very small interval and ignoring the signal. The reproducer arms the
    alarm timer with a relative expiry of 8ns and an interval of 9ns. Not a
    problem per se, but that's an issue when the signal is ignored because then
    the timer is immediately rearmed because there is no way to delay that
    rearming to the signal delivery path.  See posix_timer_fn() and commit
    58229a189942 ("posix-timers: Prevent softirq starvation by small intervals
    and SIG_IGN") for details.
    
    The reproducer does not set SIG_IGN explicitely, but it sets up the timers
    signal with SIGCONT. That has the same effect as explicitely setting
    SIG_IGN for a signal as SIGCONT is ignored if there is no handler set and
    the task is not ptraced.
    
    The log clearly shows that:
    
       [pid  5102] --- SIGCONT {si_signo=SIGCONT, si_code=SI_TIMER, si_timerid=0, si_overrun=316014, si_int=0, si_ptr=NULL} ---
    
    It works because the tasks are traced and therefore the signal is queued so
    the tracer can see it, which delays the restart of the timer to the signal
    delivery path. But then the tracer is killed:
    
       [pid  5087] kill(-5102, SIGKILL <unfinished ...>
       ...
       ./strace-static-x86_64: Process 5107 detached
    
    and after it's gone the stall can be observed:
    
       syzkaller login: [   79.439102][    C0] hrtimer: interrupt took 68471 ns
       [  184.460538][    C1] rcu: INFO: rcu_preempt detected stalls on CPUs/tasks:

       [  184.670045][    C0]  alarmtimer_fired+0x327/0x670
    
    posix_timer_fn() prevents that by checking whether the interval for
    timers which have the signal ignored is smaller than a jiffie and
    artifically delay it by shifting the next expiry out by a jiffie. That's
    accurate vs. the overrun accounting, but slightly inaccurate
    vs. timer_gettimer(2).
    
    The comment in that function says what needs to be done and there was a fix
    available for the regular userspace induced SIG_IGN mechanism, but that did
    not work due to the implicit ignore for SIGCONT and similar signals. This
    needs to be worked on, but for now the only available workaround is to do
    exactly what posix_timer_fn() does:
    
    Increase the interval of self-rearming timers, which have their signal
    ignored, to at least a jiffie.
    
    Interestingly this has been fixed before via commit ff86bf0c65f1
    ("alarmtimer: Rate limit periodic intervals") already, but that fix got
    lost in a later rework.

    random: always mix cycle counter in add_latent_entropy()
    
    [ Upstream commit d7bf7f3b813e3755226bcb5114ad2ac477514ebf ]
    
    add_latent_entropy() is called every time a process forks, in
    kernel_clone(). This in turn calls add_device_randomness() using the
    latent entropy global state. add_device_randomness() does two things:
    
       2) Mixes into the input pool the latent entropy argument passed; and
       1) Mixes in a cycle counter, a sort of measurement of when the event
          took place, the high precision bits of which are presumably
          difficult to predict.
    
    (2) is impossible without CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_LATENT_ENTROPY=y. But (1) is
    always possible. However, currently CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_LATENT_ENTROPY=n
    disables both (1) and (2), instead of just (2).
    
    This commit causes the CONFIG_GCC_PLUGIN_LATENT_ENTROPY=n case to still
    do (1) by passing NULL (len 0) to add_device_randomness() when add_latent_
    entropy() is called.

    wifi: rtl8xxxu: gen2: Turn on the rate control
    
    [ Upstream commit 791082ec0ab843e0be07c8ce3678e4c2afd2e33d ]
    
    Re-enable the function rtl8xxxu_gen2_report_connect.
    
    It informs the firmware when connecting to a network. This makes the
    firmware enable the rate control, which makes the upload faster.
    
    It also informs the firmware when disconnecting from a network. In the
    past this made reconnecting impossible because it was sending the
    auth on queue 0x7 (TXDESC_QUEUE_VO) instead of queue 0x12
    (TXDESC_QUEUE_MGNT):
    
    wlp0s20f0u3: send auth to 90:55:de:__:__:__ (try 1/3)
    wlp0s20f0u3: send auth to 90:55:de:__:__:__ (try 2/3)
    wlp0s20f0u3: send auth to 90:55:de:__:__:__ (try 3/3)
    wlp0s20f0u3: authentication with 90:55:de:__:__:__ timed out
    
    Probably the firmware disables the unnecessary TX queues when it
    knows it's disconnected.
    
    However, this was fixed in commit edd5747aa12e ("wifi: rtl8xxxu: Fix
    skb misuse in TX queue selection").
