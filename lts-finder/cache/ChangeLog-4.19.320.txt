    commit ab091ec536cb7b271983c0c063b17f62f3591583 upstream.
    
    There is a hardware power-saving problem with the Lenovo N60z
    board. When turn it on and leave it for 10 hours, there is a
    20% chance that a nvme disk will not wake up until reboot.

    exec: Fix ToCToU between perm check and set-uid/gid usage
    
    commit f50733b45d865f91db90919f8311e2127ce5a0cb upstream.
    
    When opening a file for exec via do_filp_open(), permission checking is
    done against the file's metadata at that moment, and on success, a file
    pointer is passed back. Much later in the execve() code path, the file
    metadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how
    to set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the
    permissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges.
    
    For example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not
    set-id:
    
    ---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target
    
    to set-id and non-executable:
    
    ---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target
    
    it is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been
    disallowed.
    
    While this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been
    observed (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating
    the setuid bits of installed programs. Such files start with being
    world-executable but then are adjusted to be group-exec with a set-uid
    bit. For example, "chmod o-x,u+s target" makes "target" executable only
    by uid "root" and gid "cdrom", while also becoming setuid-root:
    
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target
    
    becomes:
    
    -rwsr-xr-- 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target
    
    But racing the chmod means users without group "cdrom" membership can
    get the permission to execute "target" just before the chmod, and when
    the chmod finishes, the exec reaches brpm_fill_uid(), and performs the
    setuid to root, violating the expressed authorization of "only cdrom
    group members can setuid to root".
    
    Re-check that we still have execute permissions in case the metadata
    has changed. It would be better to keep a copy from the perm-check time,
    but until we can do that refactoring, the least-bad option is to do a
    full inode_permission() call (under inode lock). It is understood that
    this is safe against dead-locks, but hardly optimal.

    drm/i915/gem: Fix Virtual Memory mapping boundaries calculation
    
    commit 8bdd9ef7e9b1b2a73e394712b72b22055e0e26c3 upstream.
    
    Calculating the size of the mapped area as the lesser value
    between the requested size and the actual size does not consider
    the partial mapping offset. This can cause page fault access.
    
    Fix the calculation of the starting and ending addresses, the
    total size is now deduced from the difference between the end and
    start addresses.
    
    Additionally, the calculations have been rewritten in a clearer
    and more understandable form.

    arm64: cpufeature: Fix the visibility of compat hwcaps
    
    commit 85f1506337f0c79a4955edfeee86a18628e3735f upstream.
    
    Commit 237405ebef58 ("arm64: cpufeature: Force HWCAP to be based on the
    sysreg visible to user-space") forced the hwcaps to use sanitised
    user-space view of the id registers. However, the ID register structures
    used to select few compat cpufeatures (vfp, crc32, ...) are masked and
    hence such hwcaps do not appear in /proc/cpuinfo anymore for PER_LINUX32
    personality.
    
    Add the ID register structures explicitly and set the relevant entry as
    visible. As these ID registers are now of type visible so make them
    available in 64-bit userspace by making necessary changes in register
    emulation logic and documentation.
    
    While at it, update the comment for structure ftr_generic_32bits[] which
    lists the ID register that use it.

    netfilter: nf_tables: prefer nft_chain_validate
    
    commit cff3bd012a9512ac5ed858d38e6ed65f6391008c upstream
    
    nft_chain_validate already performs loop detection because a cycle will
    result in a call stack overflow (ctx->level >= NFT_JUMP_STACK_SIZE).
    
    It also follows maps via ->validate callback in nft_lookup, so there
    appears no reason to iterate the maps again.
    
    nf_tables_check_loops() and all its helper functions can be removed.
    This improves ruleset load time significantly, from 23s down to 12s.
    
    This also fixes a crash bug. Old loop detection code can result in
    unbounded recursion:
    
    BUG: TASK stack guard page was hit at ....
    Oops: stack guard page: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN
    CPU: 4 PID: 1539 Comm: nft Not tainted 6.10.0-rc5+ #1
    [..]
    
    with a suitable ruleset during validation of register stores.
    
    I can't see any actual reason to attempt to check for this from
    nft_validate_register_store(), at this point the transaction is still in
    progress, so we don't have a full picture of the rule graph.
    
    For nf-next it might make sense to either remove it or make this depend
    on table->validate_state in case we could catch an error earlier
    (for improved error reporting to userspace).

    netfilter: nf_tables: use timestamp to check for set element timeout
    
    commit 7395dfacfff65e9938ac0889dafa1ab01e987d15 upstream
    
    Add a timestamp field at the beginning of the transaction, store it

    Update set backend .insert, .deactivate and sync gc path to use the
    timestamp, this avoids that an element expires while control plane
    transaction is still unfinished.
    
    .lookup and .update, which are used from packet path, still use the
    current time to check if the element has expired. And .get path and dump
    also since this runs lockless under rcu read size lock. Then, there is
    async gc which also needs to check the current time since it runs
    asynchronously from a workqueue.
    
    [ NB: rbtree GC updates has been excluded because GC is asynchronous. ]

    kbuild: Fix '-S -c' in x86 stack protector scripts
    
    commit 3415b10a03945b0da4a635e146750dfe5ce0f448 upstream.
    
    After a recent change in clang to stop consuming all instances of '-S'
    and '-c' [1], the stack protector scripts break due to the kernel's use
    of -Werror=unused-command-line-argument to catch cases where flags are
    not being properly consumed by the compiler driver:
    
      $ echo | clang -o - -x c - -S -c -Werror=unused-command-line-argument
      clang: error: argument unused during compilation: '-c' [-Werror,-Wunused-command-line-argument]
    
    This results in CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR getting disabled because
    CONFIG_CC_HAS_SANE_STACKPROTECTOR is no longer set.
    
    '-c' and '-S' both instruct the compiler to stop at different stages of
    the pipeline ('-S' after compiling, '-c' after assembling), so having
    them present together in the same command makes little sense. In this
    case, the test wants to stop before assembling because it is looking at
    the textual assembly output of the compiler for either '%fs' or '%gs',
    so remove '-c' from the list of arguments to resolve the error.
    
    All versions of GCC continue to work after this change, along with
    versions of clang that do or do not contain the change mentioned above.

    x86/mtrr: Check if fixed MTRRs exist before saving them
    
    commit 919f18f961c03d6694aa726c514184f2311a4614 upstream.
    
    MTRRs have an obsolete fixed variant for fine grained caching control
    of the 640K-1MB region that uses separate MSRs. This fixed variant has
    a separate capability bit in the MTRR capability MSR.
    
    So far all x86 CPUs which support MTRR have this separate bit set, so it
    went unnoticed that mtrr_save_state() does not check the capability bit
    before accessing the fixed MTRR MSRs.
    
    Though on a CPU that does not support the fixed MTRR capability this
    results in a #GP.  The #GP itself is harmless because the RDMSR fault is
    handled gracefully, but results in a WARN_ON().
    
    Add the missing capability check to prevent this.

    tracing: Fix overflow in get_free_elt()
    
    commit bcf86c01ca4676316557dd482c8416ece8c2e143 upstream.
    
    "tracing_map->next_elt" in get_free_elt() is at risk of overflowing.
    
    Once it overflows, new elements can still be inserted into the tracing_map
    even though the maximum number of elements (`max_elts`) has been reached.
    Continuing to insert elements after the overflow could result in the
    tracing_map containing "tracing_map->max_size" elements, leaving no empty
    entries.
    If any attempt is made to insert an element into a full tracing_map using
    `__tracing_map_insert()`, it will cause an infinite loop with preemption
    disabled, leading to a CPU hang problem.
    
    Fix this by preventing any further increments to "tracing_map->next_elt"
    once it reaches "tracing_map->max_elt".

    power: supply: axp288_charger: Fix constant_charge_voltage writes
    
    commit b34ce4a59cfe9cd0d6f870e6408e8ec88a964585 upstream.
    
    info->max_cv is in millivolts, divide the microvolt value being written
    to constant_charge_voltage by 1000 *before* clamping it to info->max_cv.
    
    Before this fix the code always tried to set constant_charge_voltage
    to max_cv / 1000 = 4 millivolt, which ends up in setting it to 4.1V
    which is the lowest supported value.

    serial: core: check uartclk for zero to avoid divide by zero
    
    commit 6eabce6608d6f3440f4c03aa3d3ef50a47a3d193 upstream.
    
    Calling ioctl TIOCSSERIAL with an invalid baud_base can
    result in uartclk being zero, which will result in a
    divide by zero error in uart_get_divisor(). The check for
    uartclk being zero in uart_set_info() needs to be done
    before other settings are made as subsequent calls to
    ioctl TIOCSSERIAL for the same port would be impacted if
    the uartclk check was done where uartclk gets set.

    ntp: Safeguard against time_constant overflow
    
    commit 06c03c8edce333b9ad9c6b207d93d3a5ae7c10c0 upstream.
    
    Using syzkaller with the recently reintroduced signed integer overflow
    sanitizer produces this UBSAN report:
    
    UBSAN: signed-integer-overflow in ../kernel/time/ntp.c:738:18
    9223372036854775806 + 4 cannot be represented in type 'long'

     __do_adjtimex+0x1236/0x1440
     do_adjtimex+0x2be/0x740
    
    The user supplied time_constant value is incremented by four and then
    clamped to the operating range.
    
    Before commit eea83d896e31 ("ntp: NTP4 user space bits update") the user
    supplied value was sanity checked to be in the operating range. That change
    removed the sanity check and relied on clamping after incrementing which
    does not work correctly when the user supplied value is in the overflow
    zone of the '+ 4' operation.
    
    The operation requires CAP_SYS_TIME and the side effect of the overflow is
    NTP getting out of sync.
    
    Similar to the fixups for time_maxerror and time_esterror, clamp the user
    space supplied value to the operating range.

    driver core: Fix uevent_show() vs driver detach race
    
    commit 15fffc6a5624b13b428bb1c6e9088e32a55eb82c upstream.
    
    uevent_show() wants to de-reference dev->driver->name. There is no clean
    way for a device attribute to de-reference dev->driver unless that
    attribute is defined via (struct device_driver).dev_groups. Instead, the
    anti-pattern of taking the device_lock() in the attribute handler risks
    deadlocks with code paths that remove device attributes while holding
    the lock.
    
    This deadlock is typically invisible to lockdep given the device_lock()
    is marked lockdep_set_novalidate_class(), but some subsystems allocate a
    local lockdep key for @dev->mutex to reveal reports of the form:

    The observation though is that driver objects are typically much longer
    lived than device objects. It is reasonable to perform lockless
    de-reference of a @driver pointer even if it is racing detach from a
    device. Given the infrequency of driver unregistration, use
    synchronize_rcu() in module_remove_driver() to close any potential
    races.  It is potentially overkill to suffer synchronize_rcu() just to
    handle the rare module removal racing uevent_show() event.

    ntp: Clamp maxerror and esterror to operating range
    
    [ Upstream commit 87d571d6fb77ec342a985afa8744bb9bb75b3622 ]
    
    Using syzkaller alongside the newly reintroduced signed integer overflow
    sanitizer spits out this report:
    
    UBSAN: signed-integer-overflow in ../kernel/time/ntp.c:461:16
    9223372036854775807 + 500 cannot be represented in type 'long'
    Call Trace:
     handle_overflow+0x171/0x1b0

     timekeeping_advance+0x1fe/0x890
     update_wall_time+0x10/0x30
    
    time_maxerror is unconditionally incremented and the result is checked
    against NTP_PHASE_LIMIT, but the increment itself can overflow, resulting
    in wrap-around to negative space.
    
    Before commit eea83d896e31 ("ntp: NTP4 user space bits update") the user
    supplied value was sanity checked to be in the operating range. That change
    removed the sanity check and relied on clamping in handle_overflow() which
    does not work correctly when the user supplied value is in the overflow
    zone of the '+ 500' operation.
    
    The operation requires CAP_SYS_TIME and the side effect of the overflow is
    NTP getting out of sync.
    
    Miroslav confirmed that the input value should be clamped to the operating
    range and the same applies to time_esterror. The latter is not used by the
    kernel, but the value still should be in the operating range as it was
    before the sanity check got removed.
    
    Clamp them to the operating range.

    tick/broadcast: Move per CPU pointer access into the atomic section
    
    commit 6881e75237a84093d0986f56223db3724619f26e upstream.
    
    The recent fix for making the take over of the broadcast timer more
    reliable retrieves a per CPU pointer in preemptible context.
    
    This went unnoticed as compilers hoist the access into the non-preemptible
    region where the pointer is actually used. But of course it's valid that
    the compiler keeps it at the place where the code puts it which rightfully
    triggers:

           caller is hotplug_cpu__broadcast_tick_pull+0x1c/0xc0
    
    Move it to the actual usage site which is in a non-preemptible region.

    commit ab9fd06cb8f0db0854291833fc40c789e43a361f upstream.
    
    The ufshcd_add_delay_before_dme_cmd() always introduces a delay of
    MIN_DELAY_BEFORE_DME_CMDS_US between DME commands even when it's not
    required. The delay is added when the UFS host controller supplies the
    quirk UFSHCD_QUIRK_DELAY_BEFORE_DME_CMDS.
    
    Fix the logic to update hba->last_dme_cmd_tstamp to ensure subsequent DME
    commands have the correct delay in the range of 0 to
    MIN_DELAY_BEFORE_DME_CMDS_US.

    USB: serial: debug: do not echo input by default
    
    commit 00af4f3dda1461ec90d892edc10bec6d3c50c554 upstream.
    
    This driver is intended as a "client" end of the console connection.
    When connected to a host it's supposed to receive debug logs, and
    possibly allow to interact with whatever debug console is available
    there. Feeding messages back, depending on a configuration may cause log
    messages be executed as shell commands (which can be really bad if one
    is unlucky, imagine a log message like "prevented running `rm -rf
    /home`"). In case of Xen, it exposes sysrq-like debug interface, and
    feeding it its own logs will pretty quickly hit 'R' for "instant
    reboot".
    
    Contrary to a classic serial console, the USB one cannot be configured
    ahead of time, as the device shows up only when target OS is up. And at
    the time device is opened to execute relevant ioctl, it's already too
    late, especially when logs start flowing shortly after device is
    initialized.
    Avoid the issue by changing default to no echo for this type of devices.

    completion callback and the rawmidi API access.  This could be a cause
    of KMSAN warning triggered by syzkaller below (so put as reported-by
    here).
    
    This patch protects the midibuf call of the former code path with a
    spinlock for avoiding the possible races.

    spi: spi-fsl-lpspi: Fix scldiv calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit 730bbfaf7d4890bd99e637db7767dc68cfeb24e7 ]
    
    The effective SPI clock frequency should never exceed speed_hz
    otherwise this might result in undefined behavior of the SPI device.
    
    Currently the scldiv calculation could violate this constraint.
    For the example parameters perclk_rate = 24 MHz and speed_hz = 7 MHz,
    the function fsl_lpspi_set_bitrate will determine perscale = 0 and
    scldiv = 1, which is a effective SPI clock of 8 MHz.
    
    So fix this by rounding up the quotient of perclk_rate and speed_hz.
    While this never change within the loop, we can pull this out.

    Add slave mode support to the fsl-lpspi driver, only in PIO mode.
    
    For now, there are some limitations for slave mode transmission:
    1. The stale data in RXFIFO will be dropped when the Slave does any new
       transfer.
    2. One transfer can be finished only after all transfer->len data been
       transferred to master device
    3. Slave device only accepts transfer->len data. Any data longer than
       this from master device will be dropped. Any data shorter than this
       from master will cause LPSPI to stuck due to mentioned limitation 2.
    4. Only PIO transfer is supported in Slave Mode.
    
    Wire connection:
    GND, SCK, MISO(to MISO of slave), MOSI(to MOSI of slave), SCS

    i2c: smbus: Send alert notifications to all devices if source not found
    
    [ Upstream commit f6c29f710c1ff2590109f83be3e212b86c01e0f3 ]
    
    If a SMBus alert is received and the originating device is not found,
    the reason may be that the address reported on the SMBus alert address
    is corrupted, for example because multiple devices asserted alert and
    do not correctly implement SMBus arbitration.
    
    If this happens, call alert handlers on all devices connected to the
    given I2C bus, in the hope that this cleans up the situation.
    
    This change reliably fixed the problem on a system with multiple devices
    on a single bus. Example log where the device on address 0x18 (ADM1021)
    and on address 0x4c (ADT7461A) both had the alert line asserted:
    
    smbus_alert 3-000c: SMBALERT# from dev 0x0c, flag 0
    smbus_alert 3-000c: no driver alert()!
    smbus_alert 3-000c: SMBALERT# from dev 0x0c, flag 0
    smbus_alert 3-000c: no driver alert()!

    i2c: smbus: Improve handling of stuck alerts
    
    [ Upstream commit 37c526f00bc1c4f847fc800085f8f009d2e11be6 ]
    
    The following messages were observed while testing alert functionality
    on systems with multiple I2C devices on a single bus if alert was active
    on more than one chip.
    
    smbus_alert 3-000c: SMBALERT# from dev 0x0c, flag 0
    smbus_alert 3-000c: no driver alert()!
    
    and:
    
    smbus_alert 3-000c: SMBALERT# from dev 0x28, flag 0
    
    Once it starts, this message repeats forever at high rate. There is no
    device at any of the reported addresses.
    
    Analysis shows that this is seen if multiple devices have the alert pin
    active. Apparently some devices do not support SMBus arbitration correctly.
    They keep sending address bits after detecting an address collision and
    handle the collision not at all or too late.
    Specifically, address 0x0c is seen with ADT7461A at address 0x4c and
    ADM1021 at address 0x18 if alert is active on both chips. Address 0x28 is
    seen with ADT7483 at address 0x2a and ADT7461 at address 0x4c if alert is
    active on both chips.
    
    Once the system is in bad state (alert is set by more than one chip),
    it often only recovers by power cycling.
    
    To reduce the impact of this problem, abort the endless loop in
    smbus_alert() if the same address is read more than once and not
    handled by a driver.

    arm64: errata: Expand speculative SSBS workaround (again)
    
    [ Upstream commit adeec61a4723fd3e39da68db4cc4d924e6d7f641 ]
    
    A number of Arm Ltd CPUs suffer from errata whereby an MSR to the SSBS
    special-purpose register does not affect subsequent speculative
    instructions, permitting speculative store bypassing for a window of
    time.
    
    We worked around this for a number of CPUs in commits:
    
    * 7187bb7d0b5c7dfa ("arm64: errata: Add workaround for Arm errata 3194386 and 3312417")
    * 75b3c43eab594bfb ("arm64: errata: Expand speculative SSBS workaround")
    
    Since then, similar errata have been published for a number of other Arm
    Ltd CPUs, for which the same mitigation is sufficient. This is described
    in their respective Software Developer Errata Notice (SDEN) documents:
    
    * Cortex-A76 (MP052) SDEN v31.0, erratum 3324349
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-885749/3100/
    
    * Cortex-A77 (MP074) SDEN v19.0, erratum 3324348
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-1152370/1900/
    
    * Cortex-A78 (MP102) SDEN v21.0, erratum 3324344
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-1401784/2100/
    
    * Cortex-A78C (MP138) SDEN v16.0, erratum 3324346
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-1707916/1600/
    
    * Cortex-A78C (MP154) SDEN v10.0, erratum 3324347
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-2004089/1000/
    
    * Cortex-A725 (MP190) SDEN v5.0, erratum 3456106
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-2832921/0500/
    
    * Cortex-X1 (MP077) SDEN v21.0, erratum 3324344
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-1401782/2100/
    
    * Cortex-X1C (MP136) SDEN v16.0, erratum 3324346
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-1707914/1600/
    
    * Neoverse-N1 (MP050) SDEN v32.0, erratum 3324349
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-885747/3200/
    
    * Neoverse-V1 (MP076) SDEN v19.0, erratum 3324341
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-1401781/1900/
    
    Note that due to the manner in which Arm develops IP and tracks errata,
    some CPUs share a common erratum number and some CPUs have multiple
    erratum numbers for the same HW issue.
    
    On parts without SB, it is necessary to use ISB for the workaround. The
    spec_bar() macro used in the mitigation will expand to a "DSB SY; ISB"
    sequence in this case, which is sufficient on all affected parts.
    
    Enable the existing mitigation by adding the relevant MIDRs to
    erratum_spec_ssbs_list. The list is sorted alphanumerically (involving
    moving Neoverse-V3 after Neoverse-V2) so that this is easy to audit and
    potentially extend again in future. The Kconfig text is also updated to
    clarify the set of affected parts and the mitigation.

    We worked around this for Cortex-X4 and Neoverse-V3, in commit:
    
      7187bb7d0b5c7dfa ("arm64: errata: Add workaround for Arm errata 3194386 and 3312417")
    
    ... as per their Software Developer Errata Notice (SDEN) documents:
    
    * Cortex-X4 SDEN v8.0, erratum 3194386:
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-2432808/0800/
    
    * Neoverse-V3 SDEN v6.0, erratum 3312417:
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-2891958/0600/
    
    Since then, similar errata have been published for a number of other Arm Ltd
    CPUs, for which the mitigation is the same. This is described in their
    respective SDEN documents:
    
    * Cortex-A710 SDEN v19.0, errataum 3324338
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-1775101/1900/?lang=en
    
    * Cortex-A720 SDEN v11.0, erratum 3456091
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-2439421/1100/?lang=en
    
    * Cortex-X2 SDEN v19.0, erratum 3324338
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-1775100/1900/?lang=en
    
    * Cortex-X3 SDEN v14.0, erratum 3324335
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-2055130/1400/?lang=en
    
    * Cortex-X925 SDEN v8.0, erratum 3324334
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109108/800/?lang=en
    
    * Neoverse-N2 SDEN v17.0, erratum 3324339
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-1982442/1700/?lang=en
    
    * Neoverse-V2 SDEN v9.0, erratum 3324336
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-2332927/900/?lang=en
    
    Note that due to shared design lineage, some CPUs share the same erratum
    number.
    
    Add these to the existing mitigation under CONFIG_ARM64_ERRATUM_3194386.
    As listing all of the erratum IDs in the runtime description would be
    unwieldy, this is reduced to:
    
            "SSBS not fully self-synchronizing"
    
    ... matching the description of the errata in all of the SDENs.

    arm64: errata: Unify speculative SSBS errata logic
    
    [ Upstream commit ec768766608092087dfb5c1fc45a16a6f524dee2 ]
    
    Cortex-X4 erratum 3194386 and Neoverse-V3 erratum 3312417 are identical,
    with duplicate Kconfig text and some unsightly ifdeffery. While we try
    to share code behind CONFIG_ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_SSBS, having
    separate options results in a fair amount of boilerplate code, and this
    will only get worse as we expand the set of affected CPUs.
    
    To reduce this boilerplate, unify the two behind a common Kconfig
    option. This removes the duplicate text and Kconfig logic, and removes
    the need for the intermediate ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_SSBS option.
    The set of affected CPUs is described as a list so that this can easily
    be extended.
    
    I've used ARM64_ERRATUM_3194386 (matching the Neoverse-V3 erratum ID) as
    the common option, matching the way we use ARM64_ERRATUM_1319367 to
    cover Cortex-A57 erratum 1319537 and Cortex-A72 erratum 1319367.

    arm64: errata: Add workaround for Arm errata 3194386 and 3312417
    
    [ Upstream commit 7187bb7d0b5c7dfa18ca82e9e5c75e13861b1d88 ]
    
    Cortex-X4 and Neoverse-V3 suffer from errata whereby an MSR to the SSBS
    special-purpose register does not affect subsequent speculative
    instructions, permitting speculative store bypassing for a window of
    time. This is described in their Software Developer Errata Notice (SDEN)
    documents:
    
    * Cortex-X4 SDEN v8.0, erratum 3194386:
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-2432808/0800/
    
    * Neoverse-V3 SDEN v6.0, erratum 3312417:
      https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN-2891958/0600/
    
    To workaround these errata, it is necessary to place a speculation
    barrier (SB) after MSR to the SSBS special-purpose register. This patch
    adds the requisite SB after writes to SSBS within the kernel, and hides
    the presence of SSBS from EL0 such that userspace software which cares
    about SSBS will manipulate this via prctl(PR_GET_SPECULATION_CTRL, ...).

    arm64: cpufeature: Force HWCAP to be based on the sysreg visible to user-space
    
    [ Upstream commit 237405ebef580a7352a52129b2465c117145eafa ]
    
    arm64 advertises hardware features to user-space via HWCAPs, and by
    emulating access to the CPUs id registers. The cpufeature code has a
    sanitised system-wide view of an id register, and a sanitised user-space
    view of an id register, where some features use their 'safe' value
    instead of the hardware value.
    
    It is currently possible for a HWCAP to be advertised where the user-space
    view of the id register does not show the feature as supported.
    Erratum workaround need to remove both the HWCAP, and the feature from
    the user-space view of the id register. This involves duplicating the
    code, and spreading it over cpufeature.c and cpu_errata.c.
    
    Make the HWCAP code use the user-space view of id registers. This ensures
    the values never diverge, and allows erratum workaround to remove HWCAP
    by modifying the user-space view of the id register.

    SUNRPC: Fix a race to wake a sync task
    
    [ Upstream commit ed0172af5d6fc07d1b40ca82f5ca3979300369f7 ]
    
    We've observed NFS clients with sync tasks sleeping in __rpc_execute
    waiting on RPC_TASK_QUEUED that have not responded to a wake-up from
    rpc_make_runnable().  I suspect this problem usually goes unnoticed,
    because on a busy client the task will eventually be re-awoken by another
    task completion or xprt event.  However, if the state manager is draining
    the slot table, a sync task missing a wake-up can result in a hung client.
    
    We've been able to prove that the waker in rpc_make_runnable() successfully
    calls wake_up_bit() (ie- there's no race to tk_runstate), but the
    wake_up_bit() call fails to wake the waiter.  I suspect the waker is
    missing the load of the bit's wait_queue_head, so waitqueue_active() is
    false.  There are some very helpful comments about this problem above
    wake_up_bit(), prepare_to_wait(), and waitqueue_active().
    
    Fix this by inserting smp_mb__after_atomic() before the wake_up_bit(),
    which pairs with prepare_to_wait() calling set_current_state().

    s390/sclp: Prevent release of buffer in I/O
    
    [ Upstream commit bf365071ea92b9579d5a272679b74052a5643e35 ]
    
    When a task waiting for completion of a Store Data operation is
    interrupted, an attempt is made to halt this operation. If this attempt
    fails due to a hardware or firmware problem, there is a chance that the
    SCLP facility might store data into buffers referenced by the original
    operation at a later time.
    
    Handle this situation by not releasing the referenced data buffers if
    the halt attempt fails. For current use cases, this might result in a
    leak of few pages of memory in case of a rare hardware/firmware
    malfunction.

    media: uvcvideo: Fix the bandwdith quirk on USB 3.x
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e3d55fbd160b3ca376599a68b4cddfdc67d4153 ]
    
    The bandwidth fixup quirk doesn't know that SuperSpeed exists and has
    the same 8 service intervals per millisecond as High Speed, hence its
    calculations are wrong.
    
    Assume that all speeds from HS up use 8 intervals per millisecond.
    
    No further changes are needed, updated code has been confirmed to work
    with all speeds from FS to SS.

    media: uvcvideo: Ignore empty TS packets
    
    [ Upstream commit 5cd7c25f6f0576073b3d03bc4cfb1e8ca63a1195 ]
    
    Some SunplusIT cameras took a borderline interpretation of the UVC 1.5
    standard, and fill the PTS and SCR fields with invalid data if the
    package does not contain data.
    
    "STC must be captured when the first video data of a video frame is put
    on the USB bus."
    
    Some SunplusIT devices send, e.g.,
    
    buffer: 0xa7755c00 len 000012 header:0x8c stc 00000000 sof 0000 pts 00000000
    buffer: 0xa7755c00 len 000012 header:0x8c stc 00000000 sof 0000 pts 00000000
    buffer: 0xa7755c00 len 000668 header:0x8c stc 73779dba sof 070c pts 7376d37a
    
    While the UVC specification meant that the first two packets shouldn't
    have had the SCR bit set in the header.
    
    This borderline/buggy interpretation has been implemented in a variety
    of devices, from directly SunplusIT and from other OEMs that rebrand
    SunplusIT products. So quirking based on VID:PID will be problematic.
    
    All the affected modules have the following extension unit:
    VideoControl Interface Descriptor:
      guidExtensionCode         {82066163-7050-ab49-b8cc-b3855e8d221d}
    
    But the vendor plans to use that GUID in the future and fix the bug,
    this means that we should use heuristic to figure out the broken
    packets.
    
    This patch takes care of this.

    If we failed to link a free space entry because there's already a

    we don't free the associated bitmap that we had just allocated before.
    Fix that by freeing the bitmap before freeing the entry.

    clocksource/drivers/sh_cmt: Address race condition for clock events
    
    [ Upstream commit db19d3aa77612983a02bd223b3f273f896b243cf ]
    
    There is a race condition in the CMT interrupt handler. In the interrupt
    handler the driver sets a driver private flag, FLAG_IRQCONTEXT. This
    flag is used to indicate any call to set_next_event() should not be
    directly propagated to the device, but instead cached. This is done as
    the interrupt handler itself reprograms the device when needed before it
    completes and this avoids this operation to take place twice.
    
    It is unclear why this design was chosen, my suspicion is to allow the
    struct clock_event_device.event_handler callback, which is called while
    the FLAG_IRQCONTEXT is set, can update the next event without having to
    write to the device twice.
    
    Unfortunately there is a race between when the FLAG_IRQCONTEXT flag is
    set and later cleared where the interrupt handler have already started to
    write the next event to the device. If set_next_event() is called in
    this window the value is only cached in the driver but not written. This
    leads to the board to misbehave, or worse lockup and produce a splat.

    The design have been part of the driver since it was first merged in
    early 2009. It becomes increasingly harder to trigger the issue the
    older kernel version one tries. It only takes a few boots on v6.10-rc5,
    while hundreds of boots are needed to trigger it on v5.10.
    
    Close the race condition by using the CMT channel lock for the two
    competing sections. The channel lock was added to the driver after its
    initial design.

    md/raid5: avoid BUG_ON() while continue reshape after reassembling
    
    [ Upstream commit 305a5170dc5cf3d395bb4c4e9239bca6d0b54b49 ]
    
    Currently, mdadm support --revert-reshape to abort the reshape while
    reassembling, as the test 07revert-grow. However, following BUG_ON()
    can be triggerred by the test:
    
    kernel BUG at drivers/md/raid5.c:6278!
    invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP PTI
    irq event stamp: 158985
    CPU: 6 PID: 891 Comm: md0_reshape Not tainted 6.9.0-03335-g7592a0b0049a #94

     ret_from_fork_asm+0x1a/0x30
     </TASK>
    
    Root cause is that --revert-reshape update the raid_disks from 5 to 4,
    while reshape position is still set, and after reassembling the array,
    reshape position will be read from super block, then during reshape the
    checking of 'writepos' that is caculated by old reshape position will
    fail.
    
    Fix this panic the easy way first, by converting the BUG_ON() to
    WARN_ON(), and stop the reshape if checkings fail.
    
    Noted that mdadm must fix --revert-shape as well, and probably md/raid
    should enhance metadata validation as well, however this means
    reassemble will fail and there must be user tools to fix the wrong
    metadata.

    x86/mm: Fix pti_clone_pgtable() alignment assumption
    
    [ Upstream commit 41e71dbb0e0a0fe214545fe64af031303a08524c ]
    
    Guenter reported dodgy crashes on an i386-nosmp build using GCC-11
    that had the form of endless traps until entry stack exhaust and then
    #DF from the stack guard.
    
    It turned out that pti_clone_pgtable() had alignment assumptions on
    the start address, notably it hard assumes start is PMD aligned. This
    is true on x86_64, but very much not true on i386.
    
    These assumptions can cause the end condition to malfunction, leading
    to a 'short' clone. Guess what happens when the user mapping has a
    short copy of the entry text?
    
    Use the correct increment form for addr to avoid alignment
    assumptions.

    irqchip/mbigen: Fix mbigen node address layout
    
    [ Upstream commit 6be6cba9c4371d27f78d900ccfe34bb880d9ee20 ]
    
    The mbigen interrupt chip has its per node registers located in a
    contiguous region of page sized chunks. The code maps them into virtual
    address space as a contiguous region and determines the address of a node
    by using the node ID as index.
    
                        mbigen chip
           |-----------------|------------|--------------|
       mgn_node_0         mgn_node_1     ...         mgn_node_i
    |--------------|   |--------------|       |----------------------|
    [0x0000, 0x0x0FFF] [0x1000, 0x1FFF]    [i*0x1000, (i+1)*0x1000 - 1]
    
    This works correctly up to 10 nodes, but then fails because the 11th's
    array slot is used for the MGN_CLEAR registers.
    
                             mbigen chip
        |-----------|--------|--------|---------------|--------|
    mgn_node_0  mgn_node_1  ...  mgn_clear_register  ...   mgn_node_i
                                |-----------------|
                                 [0xA000, 0xAFFF]
    
    Skip the MGN_CLEAR register space when calculating the offset for node IDs
    greater than or equal to ten.

    net: usb: sr9700: fix uninitialized variable use in sr_mdio_read
    
    commit 08f3a5c38087d1569e982a121aad1e6acbf145ce upstream.
    
    It could lead to error happen because the variable res is not updated if
    the call to sr_share_read_word returns an error. In this particular case
    error code was returned and res stayed uninitialized. Same issue also
    applies to sr_read_reg.
    
    This can be avoided by checking the return value of sr_share_read_word
    and sr_read_reg, and propagating the error if the read operation failed.

    ALSA: usb-audio: Correct surround channels in UAC1 channel map
    
    commit b7b7e1ab7619deb3b299b5e5c619c3e6f183a12d upstream.
    
    USB-audio driver puts SNDRV_CHMAP_SL and _SR as left and right
    surround channels for UAC1 channel map, respectively.  But they should
    have been SNDRV_CHMAP_RL and _RR; the current value *_SL and _SR are
    rather "side" channels, not "surround".  I guess I took those
    mistakenly when I read the spec mentioning "surround left".
    
    This patch corrects those entries to be the right channels.

    protect the fetch of ->fd[fd] in do_dup2() from mispredictions
    
    commit 8aa37bde1a7b645816cda8b80df4753ecf172bf1 upstream.
    
    both callers have verified that fd is not greater than ->max_fds;
    however, misprediction might end up with
            tofree = fdt->fd[fd];
    being speculatively executed.  That's wrong for the same reasons
    why it's wrong in close_fd()/file_close_fd_locked(); the same
    solution applies - array_index_nospec(fd, fdt->max_fds) could differ
    from fd only in case of speculative execution on mispredicted path.

    The current logic only works if the PIO is between two

    can also be either before or after other ND user options
    (for example the first or last option in the RA).

    net/iucv: fix use after free in iucv_sock_close()
    
    [ Upstream commit f558120cd709682b739207b48cf7479fd9568431 ]
    
    iucv_sever_path() is called from process context and from bh context.
    iucv->path is used as indicator whether somebody else is taking care of
    severing the path (or it is already removed / never existed).
    This needs to be done with atomic compare and swap, otherwise there is a
    small window where iucv_sock_close() will try to work with a path that has
    already been severed and freed by iucv_callback_connrej() called by
    iucv_tasklet_fn().
    
    Example:

    Note that bh_lock_sock() is not serializing the tasklet context against
    process context, because the check for sock_owned_by_user() and
    corresponding handling is missing.
    
    Ideas for a future clean-up patch:
    A) Correct usage of bh_lock_sock() in tasklet context, as described in
    Link: https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/1280155406.2899.407.camel@edumazet-laptop/
    Re-enqueue, if needed. This may require adding return values to the
    tasklet functions and thus changes to all users of iucv.
    
    B) Change iucv tasklet into worker and use only lock_sock() in af_iucv.

    [ Upstream commit ad97196379d0b8cb24ef3d5006978a6554e6467f ]
    
    topa_entry->base is a bit-field. Bit-fields are not promoted to a 64-bit
    type, even if the underlying type is 64-bit, and so, if necessary, must
    be cast to a larger type when calculations are done.
    
    Fix a topa_entry->base address calculation by adding a cast.
    
    Without the cast, the address was limited to 36-bits i.e. 64GiB.
    
    The address calculation is used on systems that do not support Multiple
    Entry ToPA (only Broadwell), and affects physical addresses on or above
    64GiB. Instead of writing to the correct address, the address comprising
    the first 36 bits would be written to.
    
    Intel PT snapshot and sampling modes are not affected.

    PT uses page sized ToPA tables, where the ToPA table resides at the bottom
    and its driver-specific metadata taking up a few words at the top of the
    page. The split is currently calculated manually and needs to be redone
    every time a field is added to or removed from the metadata structure.
    Also, the 32-bit version can be made smaller.
    
    By splitting the table and metadata into separate structures, we are making
    the compiler figure out the division of the page.

    perf/x86/intel/pt: Use pointer arithmetics instead in ToPA entry calculation
    
    [ Upstream commit 539f7c26b41d4ed7d88dd9756de3966ae7ca07b4 ]
    
    Currently, pt_buffer_reset_offsets() calculates the current ToPA entry by
    casting pointers to addresses and performing ungainly subtractions and
    divisions instead of a simpler pointer arithmetic, which would be perfectly
    applicable in that case. Fix that.

    PCI: rockchip: Use GPIOD_OUT_LOW flag while requesting ep_gpio
    
    [ Upstream commit 840b7a5edf88fe678c60dee88a135647c0ea4375 ]
    
    Rockchip platforms use 'GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH' flag in the devicetree definition
    for ep_gpio. This means, whatever the logical value set by the driver for
    the ep_gpio, physical line will output the same logic level.
    
    For instance,
    
      gpiod_set_value_cansleep(rockchip->ep_gpio, 0); --> Level low
      gpiod_set_value_cansleep(rockchip->ep_gpio, 1); --> Level high
    
    But while requesting the ep_gpio, GPIOD_OUT_HIGH flag is currently used.
    Now, this also causes the physical line to output 'high' creating trouble
    for endpoint devices during host reboot.
    
    When host reboot happens, the ep_gpio will initially output 'low' due to
    the GPIO getting reset to its POR value. Then during host controller probe,
    it will output 'high' due to GPIOD_OUT_HIGH flag. Then during
    rockchip_pcie_host_init_port(), it will first output 'low' and then 'high'
    indicating the completion of controller initialization.
    
    On the endpoint side, each output 'low' of ep_gpio is accounted for PERST#
    assert and 'high' for PERST# deassert. With the above mentioned flow during
    host reboot, endpoint will witness below state changes for PERST#:
    
      (1) PERST# assert - GPIO POR state
      (2) PERST# deassert - GPIOD_OUT_HIGH while requesting GPIO
      (3) PERST# assert - rockchip_pcie_host_init_port()
      (4) PERST# deassert - rockchip_pcie_host_init_port()
    
    Now the time interval between (2) and (3) is very short as both happen
    during the driver probe(), and this results in a race in the endpoint.
    Because, before completing the PERST# deassertion in (2), endpoint got
    another PERST# assert in (3).
    
    A proper way to fix this issue is to change the GPIOD_OUT_HIGH flag in (2)
    to GPIOD_OUT_LOW. Because the usual convention is to request the GPIO with
    a state corresponding to its 'initial/default' value and let the driver
    change the state of the GPIO when required.
    
    As per that, the ep_gpio should be requested with GPIOD_OUT_LOW as it
    corresponds to the POR value of '0' (PERST# assert in the endpoint). Then
    the driver can change the state of the ep_gpio later in
    rockchip_pcie_host_init_port() as per the initialization sequence.
    
    This fixes the firmware crash issue in Qcom based modems connected to
    Rockpro64 based board.

    mm: avoid overflows in dirty throttling logic
    
    [ Upstream commit 385d838df280eba6c8680f9777bfa0d0bfe7e8b2 ]
    
    The dirty throttling logic is interspersed with assumptions that dirty
    limits in PAGE_SIZE units fit into 32-bit (so that various multiplications
    fit into 64-bits).  If limits end up being larger, we will hit overflows,
    possible divisions by 0 etc.  Fix these problems by never allowing so
    large dirty limits as they have dubious practical value anyway.  For
    dirty_bytes / dirty_background_bytes interfaces we can just refuse to set
    so large limits.  For dirty_ratio / dirty_background_ratio it isn't so
    simple as the dirty limit is computed from the amount of available memory
    which can change due to memory hotplug etc.  So when converting dirty
    limits from ratios to numbers of pages, we just don't allow the result to
    exceed UINT_MAX.
    
    This is root-only triggerable problem which occurs when the operator
    sets dirty limits to >16 TB.

    rcu_dereference(), leaves the critical section, and uses the
    pointer after that.
    
    Luckily, it's called either inside a nested RCU critical section
    or with the RTNL held.
    
    Annotate it with rcu_dereference_rtnl() instead, and remove the
    inner RCU critical section.

    ipv4: Fix incorrect source address in Record Route option
    
    [ Upstream commit cc73bbab4b1fb8a4f53a24645871dafa5f81266a ]
    
    The Record Route IP option records the addresses of the routers that
    routed the packet. In the case of forwarded packets, the kernel performs
    a route lookup via fib_lookup() and fills in the preferred source
    address of the matched route.
    
    The lookup is performed with the DS field of the forwarded packet, but
    using the RT_TOS() macro which only masks one of the two ECN bits. If
    the packet is ECT(0) or CE, the matched route might be different than
    the route via which the packet was forwarded as the input path masks
    both of the ECN bits, resulting in the wrong address being filled in the
    Record Route option.
    
    Fix by masking both of the ECN bits.

    MIPS: SMP-CPS: Fix address for GCR_ACCESS register for CM3 and later
    
    [ Upstream commit a263e5f309f32301e1f3ad113293f4e68a82a646 ]
    
    When the CM block migrated from CM2.5 to CM3.0, the address offset for
    the Global CSR Access Privilege register was modified. We saw this in
    the "MIPS64 I6500 Multiprocessing System Programmer's Guide," it is
    stated that "the Global CSR Access Privilege register is located at
    offset 0x0120" in section 5.4. It is at least the same for I6400.
    
    This fix allows to use the VP cores in SMP mode if the reset values
    were modified by the bootloader.

    dma: fix call order in dmam_free_coherent
    
    [ Upstream commit 28e8b7406d3a1f5329a03aa25a43aa28e087cb20 ]
    
    dmam_free_coherent() frees a DMA allocation, which makes the
    freed vaddr available for reuse, then calls devres_destroy()
    to remove and free the data structure used to track the DMA
    allocation. Between the two calls, it is possible for a
    concurrent task to make an allocation with the same vaddr
    and add it to the devres list.
    
    If this happens, there will be two entries in the devres list
    with the same vaddr and devres_destroy() can free the wrong
    entry, triggering the WARN_ON() in dmam_match.
    
    Fix by destroying the devres entry before freeing the DMA
    allocation.

    nilfs2: handle inconsistent state in nilfs_btnode_create_block()
    
    commit 4811f7af6090e8f5a398fbdd766f903ef6c0d787 upstream.
    
    Syzbot reported that a buffer state inconsistency was detected in
    nilfs_btnode_create_block(), triggering a kernel bug.
    
    It is not appropriate to treat this inconsistency as a bug; it can occur
    if the argument block address (the buffer index of the newly created
    block) is a virtual block number and has been reallocated due to
    corruption of the bitmap used to manage its allocation state.
    
    So, modify nilfs_btnode_create_block() and its callers to treat it as a
    possible filesystem error, rather than triggering a kernel bug.

    commit 17c743b9da9e0d073ff19fd5313f521744514939 upstream.
    
    Building the sigaltstack test with GCC on 64-bit powerpc errors with:

    This happens because GCC doesn't define __ppc__ for 64-bit builds, only
    32-bit builds. Instead use __powerpc__ to detect powerpc builds, which
    is defined by clang and GCC for 64-bit and 32-bit builds.

    RDMA/iwcm: Fix a use-after-free related to destroying CM IDs
    
    commit aee2424246f9f1dadc33faa78990c1e2eb7826e4 upstream.
    
    iw_conn_req_handler() associates a new struct rdma_id_private (conn_id) with
    an existing struct iw_cm_id (cm_id) as follows:
    
            conn_id->cm_id.iw = cm_id;
            cm_id->context = conn_id;
            cm_id->cm_handler = cma_iw_handler;
    
    rdma_destroy_id() frees both the cm_id and the struct rdma_id_private. Make
    sure that cm_work_handler() does not trigger a use-after-free by only
    freeing of the struct rdma_id_private after all pending work has finished.

    watchdog/perf: properly initialize the turbo mode timestamp and rearm counter
    
    commit f944ffcbc2e1c759764850261670586ddf3bdabb upstream.
    
    For systems on which the performance counter can expire early due to turbo
    modes the watchdog handler has a safety net in place which validates that
    since the last watchdog event there has at least 4/5th of the watchdog
    period elapsed.
    
    This works reliably only after the first watchdog event because the per
    CPU variable which holds the timestamp of the last event is never
    initialized.
    
    So a first spurious event will validate against a timestamp of 0 which
    results in a delta which is likely to be way over the 4/5 threshold of the
    period.  As this might happen before the first watchdog hrtimer event
    increments the watchdog counter, this can lead to false positives.
    
    Fix this by initializing the timestamp before enabling the hardware event.
    Reset the rearm counter as well, as that might be non zero after the
    watchdog was disabled and reenabled.

    scsi: qla2xxx: During vport delete send async logout explicitly
    
    commit 76f480d7c717368f29a3870f7d64471ce0ff8fb2 upstream.
    
    During vport delete, it is observed that during unload we hit a crash
    because of stale entries in outstanding command array.  For all these stale
    I/O entries, eh_abort was issued and aborted (fast_fail_io = 2009h) but
    I/Os could not complete while vport delete is in process of deleting.

    decompress_bunzip2: fix rare decompression failure
    
    commit bf6acd5d16057d7accbbb1bf7dc6d8c56eeb4ecc upstream.
    
    The decompression code parses a huffman tree and counts the number of
    symbols for a given bit length.  In rare cases, there may be >= 256
    symbols with a given bit length, causing the unsigned char to overflow.
    This causes a decompression failure later when the code tries and fails to
    find the bit length for a given symbol.
    
    Since the maximum number of symbols is 258, use unsigned short instead.

    binder: fix hang of unregistered readers
    
    commit 31643d84b8c3d9c846aa0e20bc033e46c68c7e7d upstream.
    
    With the introduction of binder_available_for_proc_work_ilocked() in
    commit 1b77e9dcc3da ("ANDROID: binder: remove proc waitqueue") a binder
    thread can only "wait_for_proc_work" after its thread->looper has been
    marked as BINDER_LOOPER_STATE_{ENTERED|REGISTERED}.
    
    This means an unregistered reader risks waiting indefinitely for work
    since it never gets added to the proc->waiting_threads. If there are no
    further references to its waitqueue either the task will hang. The same
    applies to readers using the (e)poll interface.
    
    I couldn't find the rationale behind this restriction. So this patch
    restores the previous behavior of allowing unregistered threads to
    "wait_for_proc_work". Note that an error message for this scenario,
    which had previously become unreachable, is now re-enabled.

    PCI: hv: Return zero, not garbage, when reading PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN
    
    commit fea93a3e5d5e6a09eb153866d2ce60ea3287a70d upstream.
    
    The intent of the code snippet is to always return 0 for both
    PCI_INTERRUPT_LINE and PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN.
    
    The check misses PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN. This patch fixes that.
    
    This is discovered by this call in VFIO:
    
        pci_read_config_byte(vdev->pdev, PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN, &pin);
    
    The old code does not set *val to 0 because it misses the check for
    PCI_INTERRUPT_PIN. Garbage is returned in that case.

    The problem is caused by a bug in the lock.cat part of the LKMM.  Its
    computation of the rf relation for RU (read-unlocked) events is
    faulty; it implicitly assumes that every RU event must read from
    either a UL (unlock) event in another thread or from the lock's
    initial state.  Neither is true in the litmus test above, so the
    computation yields no possible executions.
    
    The lock.cat code tries to make up for this deficiency by allowing RU
    events outside of critical sections to read from the last po-previous
    UL event.  But it does this incorrectly, trying to keep these rfi links
    separate from the rfe links that might also be needed, and passing only
    the latter to herd7's cross() macro.
    
    The problem is fixed by merging the two sets of possible rf links for
    RU events and using them all in the call to cross().

    leds: ss4200: Convert PCIBIOS_* return codes to errnos
    
    commit ce068e83976140badb19c7f1307926b4b562fac4 upstream.
    
    ich7_lpc_probe() uses pci_read_config_dword() that returns PCIBIOS_*
    codes. The error handling code assumes incorrectly it's a normal errno
    and checks for < 0. The return code is returned from the probe function
    as is but probe functions should return normal errnos.
    
    Remove < 0 from the check and convert PCIBIOS_* returns code using
    pcibios_err_to_errno() into normal errno before returning it.

    wifi: mwifiex: Fix interface type change
    
    commit a17b9f590f6ec2b9f1b12b1db3bf1d181de6b272 upstream.
    
    When changing the interface type we also need to update the bss_num, the
    driver private data is searched based on a unique (bss_type, bss_num)
    tuple, therefore every time bss_type changes, bss_num must also change.
    
    This fixes for example an issue in which, after the mode changed, a
    wireless scan on the changed interface would not finish, leading to
    repeated -EBUSY messages to userspace when other scan requests were
    sent.

    ext4: make sure the first directory block is not a hole
    
    commit f9ca51596bbfd0f9c386dd1c613c394c78d9e5e6 upstream.
    
    The syzbot constructs a directory that has no dirblock but is non-inline,
    i.e. the first directory block is a hole. And no errors are reported when
    creating files in this directory in the following flow.
    
        ext4_mknod
         ...
          ext4_add_entry
            // Read block 0
            ext4_read_dirblock(dir, block, DIRENT)
              bh = ext4_bread(NULL, inode, block, 0)
              if (!bh && (type == INDEX || type == DIRENT_HTREE))
              // The first directory block is a hole
              // But type == DIRENT, so no error is reported.
    
    After that, we get a directory block without '.' and '..' but with a valid
    dentry. This may cause some code that relies on dot or dotdot (such as
    make_indexed_dir()) to crash.
    
    Therefore when ext4_read_dirblock() finds that the first directory block
    is a hole report that the filesystem is corrupted and return an error to
    avoid loading corrupted data from disk causing something bad.

    ext4: check dot and dotdot of dx_root before making dir indexed
    
    commit 50ea741def587a64e08879ce6c6a30131f7111e7 upstream.
    
    Syzbot reports a issue as follows:
    ============================================
    BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: ffffed11022e24fe
    PGD 23ffee067 P4D 23ffee067 PUD 0

     ext4_rename2+0x26e5/0x4370 fs/ext4/namei.c:4214
    [...]
    ============================================
    
    The immediate cause of this problem is that there is only one valid dentry
    for the block to be split during do_split, so split==0 results in out of
    bounds accesses to the map triggering the issue.
    
        do_split
          unsigned split
          dx_make_map
           count = 1
          split = count/2 = 0;
          continued = hash2 == map[split - 1].hash;
           ---> map[4294967295]
    
    The maximum length of a filename is 255 and the minimum block size is 1024,
    so it is always guaranteed that the number of entries is greater than or
    equal to 2 when do_split() is called.
    
    But syzbot's crafted image has no dot and dotdot in dir, and the dentry
    distribution in dirblock is as follows:
    
      bus     dentry1          hole           dentry2           free
    |xx--|xx-------------|...............|xx-------------|...............|
    0   12 (8+248)=256  268     256     524 (8+256)=264 788     236     1024
    
    So when renaming dentry1 increases its name_len length by 1, neither hole
    nor free is sufficient to hold the new dentry, and make_indexed_dir() is
    called.
    
    In make_indexed_dir() it is assumed that the first two entries of the
    dirblock must be dot and dotdot, so bus and dentry1 are left in dx_root
    because they are treated as dot and dotdot, and only dentry2 is moved
    to the new leaf block. That's why count is equal to 1.
    
    Therefore add the ext4_check_dx_root() helper function to add more sanity
    checks to dot and dotdot before starting the conversion to avoid the above
    issue.

    commit 1d8491d3e726984343dd8c3cdbe2f2b47cfdd928 upstream.
    
    On an Amiga 1200 equipped with a Warp1260 accelerator, an interrupt
    storm coming from the accelerator board causes the machine to crash in
    local_irq_enable() or auto_irq_enable().  Disabling interrupts for the
    Warp1260 in amiga_parse_bootinfo() fixes the problem.

    media: venus: fix use after free in vdec_close
    
    commit a0157b5aa34eb43ec4c5510f9c260bbb03be937e upstream.
    
    There appears to be a possible use after free with vdec_close().
    The firmware will add buffer release work to the work queue through
    HFI callbacks as a normal part of decoding. Randomly closing the
    decoder device from userspace during normal decoding can incur
    a read after free for inst.
    
    Fix it by cancelling the work in vdec_close.

    char: tpm: Fix possible memory leak in tpm_bios_measurements_open()
    
    commit 5d8e2971e817bb64225fc0b6327a78752f58a9aa upstream.
    
    In tpm_bios_measurements_open(), get_device() is called on the device
    embedded in struct tpm_chip. In the error path, however, put_device() is
    not called. This results in a reference count leak, which prevents the
    device from being properly released. This commit makes sure to call
    put_device() when the seq_open() call fails.

    af_packet: Handle outgoing VLAN packets without hardware offloading
    
    commit 79eecf631c14e7f4057186570ac20e2cfac3802e upstream.
    
    The issue initially stems from libpcap. The ethertype will be overwritten
    as the VLAN TPID if the network interface lacks hardware VLAN offloading.
    In the outbound packet path, if hardware VLAN offloading is unavailable,
    the VLAN tag is inserted into the payload but then cleared from the sk_buff
    struct. Consequently, this can lead to a false negative when checking for
    the presence of a VLAN tag, causing the packet sniffing outcome to lack
    VLAN tag information (i.e., TCI-TPID). As a result, the packet capturing
    tool may be unable to parse packets as expected.
    
    The TCI-TPID is missing because the prb_fill_vlan_info() function does not
    modify the tp_vlan_tci/tp_vlan_tpid values, as the information is in the
    payload and not in the sk_buff struct. The skb_vlan_tag_present() function
    only checks vlan_all in the sk_buff struct. In cooked mode, the L2 header
    is stripped, preventing the packet capturing tool from determining the
    correct TCI-TPID value. Additionally, the protocol in SLL is incorrect,
    which means the packet capturing tool cannot parse the L3 header correctly.

    net: netconsole: Disable target before netpoll cleanup
    
    commit 97d9fba9a812cada5484667a46e14a4c976ca330 upstream.
    
    Currently, netconsole cleans up the netpoll structure before disabling
    the target. This approach can lead to race conditions, as message
    senders (write_ext_msg() and write_msg()) check if the target is
    enabled before using netpoll. The sender can validate that the target is
    enabled, but, the netpoll might be de-allocated already, causing
    undesired behaviours.
    
    This patch reverses the order of operations:
    1. Disable the target
    2. Clean up the netpoll structure
    
    This change eliminates the potential race condition, ensuring that
    no messages are sent through a partially cleaned-up netpoll structure.

    tick/broadcast: Make takeover of broadcast hrtimer reliable
    
    commit f7d43dd206e7e18c182f200e67a8db8c209907fa upstream.
    
    Running the LTP hotplug stress test on a aarch64 machine results in
    rcu_sched stall warnings when the broadcast hrtimer was owned by the
    un-plugged CPU. The issue is the following:
    
    CPU1 (owns the broadcast hrtimer)       CPU2
    
                                    tick_broadcast_enter()
                                      // shutdown local timer device
                                      broadcast_shutdown_local()
                                    ...
                                    tick_broadcast_exit()
                                      clockevents_switch_state(dev, CLOCK_EVT_STATE_ONESHOT)
                                      // timer device is not programmed
                                      cpumask_set_cpu(cpu, tick_broadcast_force_mask)
    
                                    initiates offlining of CPU1
    take_cpu_down()
    /*
     * CPU1 shuts down and does not
     * send broadcast IPI anymore
     */
                                    takedown_cpu()
                                      hotplug_cpu__broadcast_tick_pull()
                                        // move broadcast hrtimer to this CPU
                                        clockevents_program_event()
                                          bc_set_next()
                                            hrtimer_start()
                                            /*
                                             * timer device is not programmed
                                             * because only the first expiring
                                             * timer will trigger clockevent
                                             * device reprogramming
                                             */
    
    What happens is that CPU2 exits broadcast mode with force bit set, then the
    local timer device is not reprogrammed and CPU2 expects to receive the
    expired event by the broadcast IPI. But this does not happen because CPU1
    is offlined by CPU2. CPU switches the clockevent device to ONESHOT state,
    but does not reprogram the device.
    
    The subsequent reprogramming of the hrtimer broadcast device does not
    program the clockevent device of CPU2 either because the pending expiry
    time is already in the past and the CPU expects the event to be delivered.
    As a consequence all CPUs which wait for a broadcast event to be delivered
    are stuck forever.
    
    Fix this issue by reprogramming the local timer device if the broadcast
    force bit of the CPU is set so that the broadcast hrtimer is delivered.

    nilfs2: avoid undefined behavior in nilfs_cnt32_ge macro
    
    [ Upstream commit 0f3819e8c483771a59cf9d3190cd68a7a990083c ]
    
    According to the C standard 3.4.3p3, the result of signed integer overflow
    is undefined.  The macro nilfs_cnt32_ge(), which compares two sequence
    numbers, uses signed integer subtraction that can overflow, and therefore
    the result of the calculation may differ from what is expected due to
    undefined behavior in different environments.
    
    Similar to an earlier change to the jiffies-related comparison macros in
    commit 5a581b367b5d ("jiffies: Avoid undefined behavior from signed
    overflow"), avoid this potential issue by changing the definition of the
    macro to perform the subtraction as unsigned integers, then cast the
    result to a signed integer for comparison.

    bnxt_re: Fix imm_data endianness
    
    [ Upstream commit 95b087f87b780daafad1dbb2c84e81b729d5d33f ]
    
    When map a device between servers with MLX and BCM RoCE nics, RTRS
    server complain about unknown imm type, and can't map the device,
    
    After more debug, it seems bnxt_re wrongly handle the
    imm_data, this patch fixed the compat issue with MLX for us.
    
    In off list discussion, Selvin confirmed HW is working in little endian format
    and all data needs to be converted to LE while providing.
    
    This patch fix the endianness for imm_data

    macintosh/therm_windtunnel: fix module unload.
    
    [ Upstream commit fd748e177194ebcbbaf98df75152a30e08230cc6 ]
    
    The of_device_unregister call in therm_windtunnel's module_exit procedure
    does not fully reverse the effects of of_platform_device_create in the
    module_init prodedure.  Once you unload this module, it is impossible
    to load it ever again since only the first of_platform_device_create
    call on the fan node succeeds.
    
    This driver predates first git commit, and it turns out back then
    of_platform_device_create worked differently than it does today.
    So this is actually an old regression.
    
    The appropriate function to undo of_platform_device_create now appears
    to be of_platform_device_destroy, and switching to use this makes it
    possible to unload and load the module as expected.

    powerpc/xmon: Fix disassembly CPU feature checks
    
    [ Upstream commit 14196e47c5ffe32af7ed5a51c9e421c5ea5bccce ]
    
    In the xmon disassembly code there are several CPU feature checks to
    determine what dialects should be passed to the disassembler. The
    dialect controls which instructions the disassembler will recognise.
    
    Unfortunately the checks are incorrect, because instead of passing a
    single CPU feature they are passing a mask of feature bits.
    
    For example the code:
    
      if (cpu_has_feature(CPU_FTRS_POWER5))
          dialect |= PPC_OPCODE_POWER5;
    
    Is trying to check if the system is running on a Power5 CPU. But
    CPU_FTRS_POWER5 is a mask of *all* the feature bits that are enabled on
    a Power5.
    
    In practice the test will always return true for any 64-bit CPU, because
    at least one bit in the mask will be present in the CPU_FTRS_ALWAYS
    mask.
    
    Similarly for all the other checks against CPU_FTRS_xx masks.
    
    Rather than trying to match the disassembly behaviour exactly to the
    current CPU, just differentiate between 32-bit and 64-bit, and Altivec,
    VSX and HTM.
    
    That will cause some instructions to be shown in disassembly even
    on a CPU that doesn't support them, but that's OK, objdump -d output
    has the same behaviour, and if anything it's less confusing than some
    instructions not being disassembled.

    PCI: Fix resource double counting on remove & rescan
    
    [ Upstream commit 903534fa7d30214d8ba840ab1cd9e917e0c88e41 ]
    
    pbus_size_mem() keeps the size of the optional resources in
    children_add_size. When calculating the PCI bridge window size,
    calculate_memsize() lower bounds size by old_size before adding
    children_add_size and performing the window size alignment. This
    results in double counting for the resources in children_add_size
    because old_size may be based on the previous size of the bridge
    window after it has already included children_add_size (that is,
    size1 in pbus_size_mem() from an earlier invocation of that
    function).
    
    As a result, on repeated remove of the bus & rescan cycles the resource
    size keeps increasing when children_add_size is non-zero as can be seen
    from this extract:
    
      iomem0:  23fffd00000-23fffdfffff : PCI Bus 0000:03    # 1MiB
      iomem1:  20000000000-200001fffff : PCI Bus 0000:03    # 2MiB
      iomem2:  20000000000-200002fffff : PCI Bus 0000:03    # 3MiB
      iomem3:  20000000000-200003fffff : PCI Bus 0000:03    # 4MiB
      iomem4:  20000000000-200004fffff : PCI Bus 0000:03    # 5MiB
    
    Solve the double counting by moving old_size check later in
    calculate_memsize() so that children_add_size is already accounted for.
    
    After the patch, the bridge window retains its size as expected:
    
      iomem0:  23fffd00000-23fffdfffff : PCI Bus 0000:03    # 1MiB
      iomem1:  20000000000-200000fffff : PCI Bus 0000:03    # 1MiB

    PCI: Equalize hotplug memory and io for occupied and empty slots
    
    [ Upstream commit de3ffa301142bf8802a7b0de17f9985acde5c223 ]
    
    Currently, a hotplug bridge will be given hpmemsize additional memory
    and hpiosize additional io if available, in order to satisfy any future
    hotplug allocation requirements.
    
    These calculations don't consider the current memory/io size of the
    hotplug bridge/slot, so hotplug bridges/slots which have downstream
    devices will be allocated their current allocation in addition to the
    hpmemsize value.
    
    This makes for possibly undesirable results with a mix of unoccupied and
    occupied slots (ex, with hpmemsize=2M):
    
      02:03.0 PCI bridge: <-- Occupied
              Memory behind bridge: d6200000-d64fffff [size=3M]
      02:04.0 PCI bridge: <-- Unoccupied
              Memory behind bridge: d6500000-d66fffff [size=2M]
    
    This change considers the current allocation size when using the
    hpmemsize/hpiosize parameters to make the reservations predictable for
    the mix of unoccupied and occupied slots:
    
      02:03.0 PCI bridge: <-- Occupied
              Memory behind bridge: d6200000-d63fffff [size=2M]
      02:04.0 PCI bridge: <-- Unoccupied
              Memory behind bridge: d6400000-d65fffff [size=2M]

    ext4: avoid writing unitialized memory to disk in EA inodes
    
    [ Upstream commit 65121eff3e4c8c90f8126debf3c369228691c591 ]
    
    If the extended attribute size is not a multiple of block size, the last
    block in the EA inode will have uninitialized tail which will get
    written to disk. We will never expose the data to userspace but still
    this is not a good practice so just zero out the tail of the block as it
    isn't going to cause a noticeable performance overhead.

    mfd: omap-usb-tll: Use struct_size to allocate tll
    
    [ Upstream commit 40176714c818b0b6a2ca8213cdb7654fbd49b742 ]
    
    Commit 16c2004d9e4d ("mfd: omap-usb-tll: Allocate driver data at once")
    changed the memory allocation of 'tll' to consolidate it into a single
    allocation, introducing an incorrect size calculation.
    
    In particular, the allocation for the array of pointers was converted
    into a single-pointer allocation.
    
    The memory allocation used to occur in two steps:
    
    tll = devm_kzalloc(dev, sizeof(struct usbtll_omap), GFP_KERNEL);
    tll->ch_clk = devm_kzalloc(dev, sizeof(struct clk *) * tll->nch,
                               GFP_KERNEL);
    
    And it turned that into the following allocation:
    
    tll = devm_kzalloc(dev, sizeof(*tll) + sizeof(tll->ch_clk[nch]),
                       GFP_KERNEL);
    
    sizeof(tll->ch_clk[nch]) returns the size of a single pointer instead of
    the expected nch pointers.
    
    This bug went unnoticed because the allocation size was small enough to
    fit within the minimum size of a memory allocation for this particular
    case [1].
    
    The complete allocation can still be done at once with the struct_size
    macro, which comes in handy for structures with a trailing flexible
    array.
    
    Fix the memory allocation to obtain the original size again.

    leds: trigger: Unregister sysfs attributes before calling deactivate()
    
    [ Upstream commit c0dc9adf9474ecb7106e60e5472577375aedaed3 ]
    
    Triggers which have trigger specific sysfs attributes typically store
    related data in trigger-data allocated by the activate() callback and
    freed by the deactivate() callback.
    
    Calling device_remove_groups() after calling deactivate() leaves a window
    where the sysfs attributes show/store functions could be called after
    deactivation and then operate on the just freed trigger-data.
    
    Move the device_remove_groups() call to before deactivate() to close
    this race window.
    
    This also makes the deactivation path properly do things in reverse order
    of the activation path which calls the activate() callback before calling
    device_add_groups().

    [ Upstream commit 57edbbcf5258c378a9b9d0c80d33b03a010b22c8 ]
    
    The histogram support mixes _irqsave and _irq, causing the following
    smatch warning:
    
         drivers/media/platform/renesas/vsp1/vsp1_histo.c:153 histo_stop_streaming()
         warn: mixing irqsave and irq
    
    The histo_stop_streaming() calls spin_lock_irqsave() followed by
    wait_event_lock_irq(). The former hints that interrupts may be disabled
    by the caller, while the latter reenables interrupts unconditionally.
    This doesn't cause any real bug, as the function is always called with
    interrupts enabled, but the pattern is still incorrect.
    
    Fix the problem by using spin_lock_irq() instead of spin_lock_irqsave()
    in histo_stop_streaming(). While at it, switch to spin_lock_irq() and
    spin_lock() as appropriate elsewhere.

    When the UVC device has a control that is readonly it doesn't set the

    selftests: forwarding: devlink_lib: Wait for udev events after reloading
    
    [ Upstream commit f67a90a0c8f5b3d0acc18f10650d90fec44775f9 ]
    
    Lately, an additional locking was added by commit c0a40097f0bc
    ("drivers: core: synchronize really_probe() and dev_uevent()"). The
    locking protects dev_uevent() calling. This function is used to send
    messages from the kernel to user space. Uevent messages notify user space
    about changes in device states, such as when a device is added, removed,
    or changed. These messages are used by udev (or other similar user-space
    tools) to apply device-specific rules.
    
    After reloading devlink instance, udev events should be processed. This
    locking causes a short delay of udev events handling.
    
    One example for useful udev rule is renaming ports. 'forwading.config'
    can be configured to use names after udev rules are applied. Some tests run
    devlink_reload() and immediately use the updated names. This worked before
    the above mentioned commit was pushed, but now the delay of uevent messages
    causes that devlink_reload() returns before udev events are handled and
    tests fail.
    
    Adjust devlink_reload() to not assume that udev events are already
    processed when devlink reload is done, instead, wait for udev events to
    ensure they are processed before returning from the function.

    perf: Prevent passing zero nr_pages to rb_alloc_aux()
    
    [ Upstream commit dbc48c8f41c208082cfa95e973560134489e3309 ]
    
    nr_pages is unsigned long but gets passed to rb_alloc_aux() as an int,
    and is stored as an int.
    
    Only power-of-2 values are accepted, so if nr_pages is a 64_bit value, it
    will be passed to rb_alloc_aux() as zero.
    
    That is not ideal because:
     1. the value is incorrect
     2. rb_alloc_aux() is at risk of misbehaving, although it manages to
     return -ENOMEM in that case, it is a result of passing zero to get_order()
     even though the get_order() result is documented to be undefined in that
     case.
    
    Fix by simply validating the maximum supported value in the first place.
    Use -ENOMEM error code for consistency with the current error code that
    is returned in that case.

    FEC_ECR_EN1588 bit gets cleared after MAC reset in `fec_stop()`, which
    makes all 1588 functionality shut down, and all the extended registers
    disappear, on link-down, making the adapter fall back to compatibility
    "dumb mode". However, some functionality needs to be retained (e.g. PPS)
    even without link.

    [ Upstream commit 3ac14b9dfbd345e891d48d89f6c2fa519848f0f4 ]
    
    SG_MAX_SINGLE_ALLOC is used to limit maximum number of entries that
    will be allocated in one piece of scatterlist. When the entries of
    scatterlist exceeds SG_MAX_SINGLE_ALLOC, sg chain will be used. From
    commit 7c703e54cc71 ("arch: switch the default on ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN"),
    we can know that the macro CONFIG_ARCH_NO_SG_CHAIN is used to identify
    whether sg chain is supported. So, SMC-R's rmb buffer should be limited
    by SG_MAX_SINGLE_ALLOC only when the macro CONFIG_ARCH_NO_SG_CHAIN is
    defined.

    pwm: stm32: Always do lazy disabling
    
    [ Upstream commit 7346e7a058a2c9aa9ff1cc699c7bf18a402d9f84 ]
    
    When the state changes from enabled to disabled, polarity, duty_cycle
    and period are not configured in hardware and TIM_CCER_CCxE is just
    cleared. However if the state changes from one disabled state to
    another, all parameters are written to hardware because the early exit
    from stm32_pwm_apply() is only taken if the pwm is currently enabled.
    
    This yields surprises like: Applying
    
            { .period = 1, .duty_cycle = 0, .enabled = false }
    
    succeeds if the pwm is initially on, but fails if it's already off
    because 1 is a too small period.
    
    Update the check for lazy disable to always exit early if the target
    state is disabled, no matter what is currently configured.

    [ Upstream commit 39b24cced70fdc336dbc0070f8b3bde61d8513a8 ]
    
    According to the comments on fan is disabled, we change to manual mode
    and set the duty cycle to 0.
    For setting the duty cycle part, the register is wrong. Fix it.

    x86/platform/iosf_mbi: Convert PCIBIOS_* return codes to errnos
    
    [ Upstream commit 7821fa101eab529521aa4b724bf708149d70820c ]
    
    iosf_mbi_pci_{read,write}_mdr() use pci_{read,write}_config_dword()
    that return PCIBIOS_* codes but functions also return -ENODEV which are
    not compatible error codes. As neither of the functions are related to
    PCI read/write functions, they should return normal errnos.
    
    Convert PCIBIOS_* returns code using pcibios_err_to_errno() into normal
    errno before returning it.

    x86/pci/xen: Fix PCIBIOS_* return code handling
    
    [ Upstream commit e9d7b435dfaec58432f4106aaa632bf39f52ce9f ]
    
    xen_pcifront_enable_irq() uses pci_read_config_byte() that returns
    PCIBIOS_* codes. The error handling, however, assumes the codes are
    normal errnos because it checks for < 0.
    
    xen_pcifront_enable_irq() also returns the PCIBIOS_* code back to the
    caller but the function is used as the (*pcibios_enable_irq) function
    which should return normal errnos.
    
    Convert the error check to plain non-zero check which works for
    PCIBIOS_* return codes and convert the PCIBIOS_* return code using
    pcibios_err_to_errno() into normal errno before returning it.

    other info that might help us debug this:
    
     Possible unsafe locking scenario:
    
           CPU0                    CPU1
           ----                    ----
      lock(&HFSPLUS_I(inode)->extents_lock);
                                   lock(&tree->tree_lock);
                                   lock(&HFSPLUS_I(inode)->extents_lock);
      lock(&tree->tree_lock);
    
    This is a false alarm as tree_lock mutex are different, one is
    from sbi->cat_tree, and another is from sbi->ext_tree:
    
    Thread A                        Thread B
    - hfsplus_rename
     - hfsplus_rename_cat
      - hfs_find_init
       - mutext_lock(cat_tree->tree_lock)
                                    - hfsplus_setattr
                                     - hfsplus_file_truncate
                                      - mutex_lock(hip->extents_lock)
                                      - hfs_find_init
                                       - mutext_lock(ext_tree->tree_lock)
      - hfs_bmap_reserve
       - hfsplus_file_extend
        - mutex_lock(hip->extents_lock)
    
    So, let's call mutex_lock_nested for tree_lock mutex lock, and pass
    correct lock class for it.
