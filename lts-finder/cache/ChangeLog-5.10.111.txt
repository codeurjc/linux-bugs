    powerpc: Fix virt_addr_valid() for 64-bit Book3E & 32-bit
    
    commit ffa0b64e3be58519ae472ea29a1a1ad681e32f48 upstream.
    
    mpe: On 64-bit Book3E vmalloc space starts at 0x8000000000000000.
    
    Because of the way __pa() works we have:
      __pa(0x8000000000000000) == 0, and therefore
      virt_to_pfn(0x8000000000000000) == 0, and therefore
      virt_addr_valid(0x8000000000000000) == true
    
    Which is wrong, virt_addr_valid() should be false for vmalloc space.
    In fact all vmalloc addresses that alias with a valid PFN will return
    true from virt_addr_valid(). That can cause bugs with hardened usercopy
    as described below by Kefeng Wang:
    
      When running ethtool eth0 on 64-bit Book3E, a BUG occurred:
    
        usercopy: Kernel memory exposure attempt detected from SLUB object not in SLUB page?! (offset 0, size 1048)!
        kernel BUG at mm/usercopy.c:99
        ...
        usercopy_abort+0x64/0xa0 (unreliable)
        __check_heap_object+0x168/0x190
        __check_object_size+0x1a0/0x200
        dev_ethtool+0x2494/0x2b20
        dev_ioctl+0x5d0/0x770
        sock_do_ioctl+0xf0/0x1d0
        sock_ioctl+0x3ec/0x5a0
        __se_sys_ioctl+0xf0/0x160
        system_call_exception+0xfc/0x1f0
        system_call_common+0xf8/0x200
    
      The code shows below,
    
        data = vzalloc(array_size(gstrings.len, ETH_GSTRING_LEN));
        copy_to_user(useraddr, data, gstrings.len * ETH_GSTRING_LEN))
    
      The data is alloced by vmalloc(), virt_addr_valid(ptr) will return true
      on 64-bit Book3E, which leads to the panic.
    
      As commit 4dd7554a6456 ("powerpc/64: Add VIRTUAL_BUG_ON checks for __va
      and __pa addresses") does, make sure the virt addr above PAGE_OFFSET in
      the virt_addr_valid() for 64-bit, also add upper limit check to make
      sure the virt is below high_memory.
    
      Meanwhile, for 32-bit PAGE_OFFSET is the virtual address of the start
      of lowmem, high_memory is the upper low virtual address, the check is
      suitable for 32-bit, this will fix the issue mentioned in commit
      602946ec2f90 ("powerpc: Set max_mapnr correctly") too.
    
    On 32-bit there is a similar problem with high memory, that was fixed in
    commit 602946ec2f90 ("powerpc: Set max_mapnr correctly"), but that
    commit breaks highmem and needs to be reverted.
    
    We can't easily fix __pa(), we have code that relies on its current
    behaviour. So for now add extra checks to virt_addr_valid().
    
    For 64-bit Book3S the extra checks are not necessary, the combination of
    virt_to_pfn() and pfn_valid() should yield the correct result, but they
    are harmless.

    mm/sparsemem: fix 'mem_section' will never be NULL gcc 12 warning
    
    commit a431dbbc540532b7465eae4fc8b56a85a9fc7d17 upstream.
    
    The gcc 12 compiler reports a "'mem_section' will never be NULL" warning
    on the following code:
    
        static inline struct mem_section *__nr_to_section(unsigned long nr)
        {
        #ifdef CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME
            if (!mem_section)
                    return NULL;
        #endif
            if (!mem_section[SECTION_NR_TO_ROOT(nr)])
                    return NULL;
           :
    
    It happens with CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME off.  The mem_section definition
    is
    
        #ifdef CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME
        extern struct mem_section **mem_section;
        #else
        extern struct mem_section mem_section[NR_SECTION_ROOTS][SECTIONS_PER_ROOT];
        #endif
    
    In the !CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME case, mem_section is a static
    2-dimensional array and so the check "!mem_section[SECTION_NR_TO_ROOT(nr)]"
    doesn't make sense.
    
    Fix this warning by moving the "!mem_section[SECTION_NR_TO_ROOT(nr)]"
    check up inside the CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME block and adding an
    explicit NR_SECTION_ROOTS check to make sure that there is no
    out-of-bound array access.

    irqchip/gic, gic-v3: Prevent GSI to SGI translations
    
    commit 544808f7e21cb9ccdb8f3aa7de594c05b1419061 upstream.
    
    At the moment the GIC IRQ domain translation routine happily converts
    ACPI table GSI numbers below 16 to GIC SGIs (Software Generated
    Interrupts aka IPIs). On the Devicetree side we explicitly forbid this
    translation, actually the function will never return HWIRQs below 16 when
    using a DT based domain translation.
    
    We expect SGIs to be handled in the first part of the function, and any
    further occurrence should be treated as a firmware bug, so add a check
    and print to report this explicitly and avoid lengthy debug sessions.

    arm64: module: remove (NOLOAD) from linker script
    
    commit 4013e26670c590944abdab56c4fa797527b74325 upstream.
    
    On ELF, (NOLOAD) sets the section type to SHT_NOBITS[1]. It is conceptually
    inappropriate for .plt and .text.* sections which are always
    SHT_PROGBITS.
    
    In GNU ld, if PLT entries are needed, .plt will be SHT_PROGBITS anyway
    and (NOLOAD) will be essentially ignored. In ld.lld, since
    https://reviews.llvm.org/D118840 ("[ELF] Support (TYPE=<value>) to
    customize the output section type"), ld.lld will report a `section type
    mismatch` error. Just remove (NOLOAD) to fix the error.
    
    [1] https://lld.llvm.org/ELF/linker_script.html As of today, "The
    section should be marked as not loadable" on
    https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Output-Section-Type.html is
    outdated for ELF.

    On older distros struct clone_args does not have a cgroup member,

      type 'struct clone_args'
    
    But the selftests already have a locally defined version of the
    structure which is up to date, called __clone_args.
    
    So use __clone_args which fixes the error.

    cgroup: Use open-time credentials for process migraton perm checks
    
    commit 1756d7994ad85c2479af6ae5a9750b92324685af upstream.
    
    cgroup process migration permission checks are performed at write time as
    whether a given operation is allowed or not is dependent on the content of
    the write - the PID. This currently uses current's credentials which is a
    potential security weakness as it may allow scenarios where a less
    privileged process tricks a more privileged one into writing into a fd that
    it created.
    
    This patch makes both cgroup2 and cgroup1 process migration interfaces to
    use the credentials saved at the time of open (file->f_cred) instead of
    current's.

    mm: don't skip swap entry even if zap_details specified
    
    commit 5abfd71d936a8aefd9f9ccd299dea7a164a5d455 upstream.
    
    Patch series "mm: Rework zap ptes on swap entries", v5.
    
    Patch 1 should fix a long standing bug for zap_pte_range() on
    zap_details usage.  The risk is we could have some swap entries skipped
    while we should have zapped them.
    
    Migration entries are not the major concern because file backed memory
    always zap in the pattern that "first time without page lock, then
    re-zap with page lock" hence the 2nd zap will always make sure all
    migration entries are already recovered.
    
    However there can be issues with real swap entries got skipped
    errornoously.  There's a reproducer provided in commit message of patch
    1 for that.
    
    Patch 2-4 are cleanups that are based on patch 1.  After the whole
    patchset applied, we should have a very clean view of zap_pte_range().
    
    Only patch 1 needs to be backported to stable if necessary.
    
    This patch (of 4):
    
    The "details" pointer shouldn't be the token to decide whether we should
    skip swap entries.
    
    For example, when the callers specified details->zap_mapping==NULL, it
    means the user wants to zap all the pages (including COWed pages), then
    we need to look into swap entries because there can be private COWed
    pages that was swapped out.
    
    Skipping some swap entries when details is non-NULL may lead to wrongly
    leaving some of the swap entries while we should have zapped them.
    
    A reproducer of the problem:

            }
    ===8<===
    
    We don't need to touch up the pmd path, because pmd never had a issue with
    swap entries.  For example, shmem pmd migration will always be split into
    pte level, and same to swapping on anonymous.
    
    Add another helper should_zap_cows() so that we can also check whether we
    should zap private mappings when there's no page pointer specified.
    
    This patch drops that trick, so we handle swap ptes coherently.  Meanwhile
    we should do the same check upon migration entry, hwpoison entry and
    genuine swap entries too.
    
    To be explicit, we should still remember to keep the private entries if
    even_cows==false, and always zap them when even_cows==true.
    
    The issue seems to exist starting from the initial commit of git.

    ubsan: remove CONFIG_UBSAN_OBJECT_SIZE
    
    commit 69d0db01e210e07fe915e5da91b54a867cda040f upstream.
    
    The object-size sanitizer is redundant to -Warray-bounds, and
    inappropriately performs its checks at run-time when all information
    needed for the evaluation is available at compile-time, making it quite
    difficult to use:
    
      https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214861
    
    With -Warray-bounds almost enabled globally, it doesn't make sense to
    keep this around.

    Just like its done for ldopts and for both in tools/perf/Makefile.config.
    
    Using `` to initialize PERL_EMBED_CCOPTS somehow precludes using:
    
      $(filter-out SOMETHING_TO_FILTER,$(PERL_EMBED_CCOPTS))
    
    And we need to do it to allow for building with versions of clang where
    some gcc options selected by distros are not available.

    tools build: Filter out options and warnings not supported by clang
    
    commit 41caff459a5b956b3e23ba9ca759dd0629ad3dda upstream.
    
    These make the feature check fail when using clang, so remove them just
    like is done in tools/perf/Makefile.config to build perf itself.
    
    Adding -Wno-compound-token-split-by-macro to tools/perf/Makefile.config
    when building with clang is also necessary to avoid these warnings
    turned into errors (-Werror):

    Yes, I think that is probably the best solution. As far as I can tell,
    at least in this file and context, the warning appears harmless, as the
    "create a GNU C statement expression from two different macros" is very
    much intentional, based on the presence of PERL_USE_GCC_BRACE_GROUPS.
    The warning is fixed in upstream Perl by just avoiding creating GNU C
    statement expressions using STMT_START and STMT_END:
    
      https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/18780
      https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/18984
    
    If I am reading the source code correctly, an alternative to disabling
    the warning would be specifying -DPERL_GCC_BRACE_GROUPS_FORBIDDEN but it
    seems like that might end up impacting more than just this site,
    according to the issue discussion above.

    perf python: Fix probing for some clang command line options
    
    commit dd6e1fe91cdd52774ca642d1da75b58a86356b56 upstream.
    
    The clang compiler complains about some options even without a source
    file being available, while others require one, so use the simple
    tools/build/feature/test-hello.c file.
    
    Then check for the "is not supported" string in its output, in addition
    to the "unknown argument" already being looked for.
    
    This was noticed when building with clang-13 where -ffat-lto-objects
    isn't supported and since we were looking just for "unknown argument"
    and not providing a source code to clang, was mistakenly assumed as
    being available and not being filtered to set of command line options
    provided to clang, leading to a build failure.

    whereas it is a different bit number in the RDs... Oopsie boo.

    perf: qcom_l2_pmu: fix an incorrect NULL check on list iterator
    
    commit 2012a9e279013933885983cbe0a5fe828052563b upstream.
    
    The bug is here:
            return cluster;
    
    The list iterator value 'cluster' will *always* be set and non-NULL
    by list_for_each_entry(), so it is incorrect to assume that the
    iterator value will be NULL if the list is empty or no element
    is found.
    
    To fix the bug, return 'cluster' when found, otherwise return NULL.

    ata: sata_dwc_460ex: Fix crash due to OOB write
    
    commit 7aa8104a554713b685db729e66511b93d989dd6a upstream.
    
    the driver uses libata's "tag" values from in various arrays.
    Since the mentioned patch bumped the ATA_TAG_INTERNAL to 32,
    the value of the SATA_DWC_QCMD_MAX needs to account for that.
    
    Otherwise ATA_TAG_INTERNAL usage cause similar crashes like
    this as reported by Tice Rex on the OpenWrt Forum and
    reproduced (with symbols) here:

    This is because sata_dwc_dma_xfer_complete() NULLs the
    dma_pending's next neighbour "chan" (a *dma_chan struct) in
    this '32' case right here (line ~735):
    > hsdevp->dma_pending[tag] = SATA_DWC_DMA_PENDING_NONE;
    
    Then the next time, a dma gets issued; dma_dwc_xfer_setup() passes
    the NULL'd hsdevp->chan to the dmaengine_slave_config() which then
    causes the crash.
    
    With this patch, SATA_DWC_QCMD_MAX is now set to ATA_MAX_QUEUE + 1.
    This avoids the OOB. But please note, there was a worthwhile discussion
    on what ATA_TAG_INTERNAL and ATA_MAX_QUEUE is. And why there should not
    be a "fake" 33 command-long queue size.
    
    Ideally, the dw driver should account for the ATA_TAG_INTERNAL.
    In Damien Le Moal's words: "... having looked at the driver, it
    is a bigger change than just faking a 33rd "tag" that is in fact
    not a command tag at all."

    gpio: Restrict usage of GPIO chip irq members before initialization
    
    commit 5467801f1fcbdc46bc7298a84dbf3ca1ff2a7320 upstream.
    
    GPIO chip irq members are exposed before they could be completely
    initialized and this leads to race conditions.
    
    One such issue was observed for the gc->irq.domain variable which
    was accessed through the I2C interface in gpiochip_to_irq() before
    it could be initialized by gpiochip_add_irqchip(). This resulted in
    Kernel NULL pointer dereference.
    
    Following are the logs for reference :-
    
    kernel: Call Trace:
    kernel:  gpiod_to_irq+0x53/0x70
    kernel:  acpi_dev_gpio_irq_get_by+0x113/0x1f0

    To avoid such scenarios, restrict usage of GPIO chip irq members before
    they are completely initialized.

    RDMA/hfi1: Fix use-after-free bug for mm struct
    
    commit 2bbac98d0930e8161b1957dc0ec99de39ade1b3c upstream.
    
    Under certain conditions, such as MPI_Abort, the hfi1 cleanup code may
    represent the last reference held on the task mm.
    hfi1_mmu_rb_unregister() then drops the last reference and the mm is freed
    before the final use in hfi1_release_user_pages().  A new task may
    allocate the mm structure while it is still being used, resulting in
    problems. One manifestation is corruption of the mmap_sem counter leading
    to a hang in down_write().  Another is corruption of an mm struct that is
    in use by another task.

    These patch_text implementations are using stop_machine_cpuslocked

    last CPU as the master to solve the potential risk.

    btrfs: prevent subvol with swapfile from being deleted
    
    commit 60021bd754c6ca0addc6817994f20290a321d8d6 upstream.
    
    A subvolume with an active swapfile must not be deleted otherwise it
    would not be possible to deactivate it.
    
    After the subvolume is deleted, we cannot swapoff the swapfile in this
    deleted subvolume because the path is unreachable.  The swapfile is
    still active and holding references, the filesystem cannot be unmounted.
    
    The test looks like this:
    
      mkfs.btrfs -f $dev > /dev/null
      mount $dev $mnt
    
      btrfs sub create $mnt/subvol
      touch $mnt/subvol/swapfile
      chmod 600 $mnt/subvol/swapfile
      chattr +C $mnt/subvol/swapfile
      dd if=/dev/zero of=$mnt/subvol/swapfile bs=1K count=4096
      mkswap $mnt/subvol/swapfile
      swapon $mnt/subvol/swapfile
    
      btrfs sub delete $mnt/subvol
      swapoff $mnt/subvol/swapfile  # failed: No such file or directory
      swapoff --all
    
      unmount $mnt                  # target is busy.
    
    To prevent above issue, we simply check that whether the subvolume
    contains any active swapfile, and stop the deleting process.  This
    behavior is like snapshot ioctl dealing with a swapfile.

    btrfs: fix qgroup reserve overflow the qgroup limit
    
    commit b642b52d0b50f4d398cb4293f64992d0eed2e2ce upstream.
    
    We use extent_changeset->bytes_changed in qgroup_reserve_data() to record
    how many bytes we set for EXTENT_QGROUP_RESERVED state. Currently the
    bytes_changed is set as "unsigned int", and it will overflow if we try to
    fallocate a range larger than 4GiB. The result is we reserve less bytes
    and eventually break the qgroup limit.
    
    Unlike regular buffered/direct write, which we use one changeset for
    each ordered extent, which can never be larger than 256M.  For
    fallocate, we use one changeset for the whole range, thus it no longer
    respects the 256M per extent limit, and caused the problem.
    
    The following example test script reproduces the problem:
    
      $ cat qgroup-overflow.sh
      #!/bin/bash
    
      DEV=/dev/sdj
      MNT=/mnt/sdj
    
      mkfs.btrfs -f $DEV
      mount $DEV $MNT
    
      # Set qgroup limit to 2GiB.
      btrfs quota enable $MNT
      btrfs qgroup limit 2G $MNT
    
      # Try to fallocate a 3GiB file. This should fail.
      echo
      echo "Try to fallocate a 3GiB file..."
      fallocate -l 3G $MNT/3G.file
    
      # Try to fallocate a 5GiB file.
      echo
      echo "Try to fallocate a 5GiB file..."
      fallocate -l 5G $MNT/5G.file
    
      # See we break the qgroup limit.
      echo
      sync
      btrfs qgroup show -r $MNT
    
      umount $MNT
    
    When running the test:
    
      $ ./qgroup-overflow.sh
      (...)
    
      Try to fallocate a 3GiB file...
      fallocate: fallocate failed: Disk quota exceeded
    
      Try to fallocate a 5GiB file...
    
      qgroupid         rfer         excl     max_rfer
      --------         ----         ----     --------
      0/5           5.00GiB      5.00GiB      2.00GiB
    
    Since we have no control of how bytes_changed is used, it's better to
    set it to u64.

    x86/speculation: Restore speculation related MSRs during S3 resume
    
    commit e2a1256b17b16f9b9adf1b6fea56819e7b68e463 upstream.
    
    After resuming from suspend-to-RAM, the MSRs that control CPU's
    speculative execution behavior are not being restored on the boot CPU.
    
    These MSRs are used to mitigate speculative execution vulnerabilities.
    Not restoring them correctly may leave the CPU vulnerable.  Secondary
    CPU's MSRs are correctly being restored at S3 resume by
    identify_secondary_cpu().
    
    During S3 resume, restore these MSRs for boot CPU when restoring its
    processor state.

    x86/pm: Save the MSR validity status at context setup
    
    commit 73924ec4d560257004d5b5116b22a3647661e364 upstream.
    
    The mechanism to save/restore MSRs during S3 suspend/resume checks for
    the MSR validity during suspend, and only restores the MSR if its a
    valid MSR.  This is not optimal, as an invalid MSR will unnecessarily
    throw an exception for every suspend cycle.  The more invalid MSRs,
    higher the impact will be.
    
    Check and save the MSR validity at setup.  This ensures that only valid
    MSRs that are guaranteed to not throw an exception will be attempted
    during suspend.

    mm/mempolicy: fix mpol_new leak in shared_policy_replace
    
    commit 4ad099559b00ac01c3726e5c95dc3108ef47d03e upstream.
    
    If mpol_new is allocated but not used in restart loop, mpol_new will be
    freed via mpol_put before returning to the caller.  But refcnt is not
    initialized yet, so mpol_put could not do the right things and might
    leak the unused mpol_new.  This would happen if mempolicy was updated on
    the shared shmem file while the sp->lock has been dropped during the
    memory allocation.
    
    This issue could be triggered easily with the below code snippet if
    there are many processes doing the below work at the same time:
    
      shmid = shmget((key_t)5566, 1024 * PAGE_SIZE, 0666|IPC_CREAT);
      shm = shmat(shmid, 0, 0);
      loop many times {
        mbind(shm, 1024 * PAGE_SIZE, MPOL_LOCAL, mask, maxnode, 0);
        mbind(shm + 128 * PAGE_SIZE, 128 * PAGE_SIZE, MPOL_DEFAULT, mask,
              maxnode, 0);
      }

    mmmremap.c: avoid pointless invalidate_range_start/end on mremap(old_size=0)
    
    commit 01e67e04c28170c47700c2c226d732bbfedb1ad0 upstream.
    
    If an mremap() syscall with old_size=0 ends up in move_page_tables(), it
    will call invalidate_range_start()/invalidate_range_end() unnecessarily,
    i.e.  with an empty range.
    
    This causes a WARN in KVM's mmu_notifier.  In the past, empty ranges
    have been diagnosed to be off-by-one bugs, hence the WARNing.  Given the
    low (so far) number of unique reports, the benefits of detecting more
    buggy callers seem to outweigh the cost of having to fix cases such as
    this one, where userspace is doing something silly.  In this particular
    case, an early return from move_page_tables() is enough to fix the
    issue.

    commit eafc0a02391b7b36617b36c97c4b5d6832cf5e24 upstream.
    
    When partialDecoding, it is EOF if we've either filled the output buffer

    In some extreme corner cases when compressed data is suitably corrupted,
    UAF will occur.  As reported by KASAN [1], LZ4_decompress_safe_partial
    may lead to read out of bound problem during decoding.  lz4 upstream has
    fixed it [2] and this issue has been disscussed here [3] before.
    
    current decompression routine was ported from lz4 v1.8.3, bumping
    lib/lz4 to v1.9.+ is certainly a huge work to be done later, so, we'd
    better fix it first.

    mmc: renesas_sdhi: don't overwrite TAP settings when HS400 tuning is complete
    
    commit 03e59b1e2f56245163b14c69e0a830c24b1a3a47 upstream.
    
    When HS400 tuning is complete and HS400 is going to be activated, we
    have to keep the current number of TAPs and should not overwrite them
    with a hardcoded value. This was probably a copy&paste mistake when
    upporting HS400 support from the BSP.

    iommu/omap: Fix regression in probe for NULL pointer dereference
    
    [ Upstream commit 71ff461c3f41f6465434b9e980c01782763e7ad8 ]
    
    Commit 3f6634d997db ("iommu: Use right way to retrieve iommu_ops") started
    triggering a NULL pointer dereference for some omap variants:
    
    __iommu_probe_device from probe_iommu_group+0x2c/0x38
    probe_iommu_group from bus_for_each_dev+0x74/0xbc
    bus_for_each_dev from bus_iommu_probe+0x34/0x2e8
    bus_iommu_probe from bus_set_iommu+0x80/0xc8
    bus_set_iommu from omap_iommu_init+0x88/0xcc
    omap_iommu_init from do_one_initcall+0x44/0x24
    
    This is caused by omap iommu probe returning 0 instead of ERR_PTR(-ENODEV)
    as noted by Jason Gunthorpe <jgg@ziepe.ca>.
    
    Looks like the regression already happened with an earlier commit
    6785eb9105e3 ("iommu/omap: Convert to probe/release_device() call-backs")
    that changed the function return type and missed converting one place.

    drbd: Fix five use after free bugs in get_initial_state
    
    [ Upstream commit aadb22ba2f656581b2f733deb3a467c48cc618f6 ]
    
    In get_initial_state, it calls notify_initial_state_done(skb,..) if
    cb->args[5]==1. If genlmsg_put() failed in notify_initial_state_done(),
    the skb will be freed by nlmsg_free(skb).
    Then get_initial_state will goto out and the freed skb will be used by
    return value skb->len, which is a uaf bug.
    
    What's worse, the same problem goes even further: skb can also be
    freed in the notify_*_state_change -> notify_*_state calls below.
    Thus 4 additional uaf bugs happened.
    
    My patch lets the problem callee functions: notify_initial_state_done
    and notify_*_state_change return an error code if errors happen.
    So that the error codes could be propagated and the uaf bugs can be avoid.
    
    v2 reports a compilation warning. This v3 fixed this warning and built
    successfully in my local environment with no additional warnings.

    bpf: Support dual-stack sockets in bpf_tcp_check_syncookie
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e8702cc0cfa1080f29fd64003c00a3e24ac38de ]
    
    bpf_tcp_gen_syncookie looks at the IP version in the IP header and
    validates the address family of the socket. It supports IPv4 packets in
    AF_INET6 dual-stack sockets.
    
    On the other hand, bpf_tcp_check_syncookie looks only at the address
    family of the socket, ignoring the real IP version in headers, and
    validates only the packet size. This implementation has some drawbacks:
    
    1. Packets are not validated properly, allowing a BPF program to trick
       bpf_tcp_check_syncookie into handling an IPv6 packet on an IPv4
       socket.
    
    2. Dual-stack sockets fail the checks on IPv4 packets. IPv4 clients end
       up receiving a SYNACK with the cookie, but the following ACK gets
       dropped.
    
    This patch fixes these issues by changing the checks in
    bpf_tcp_check_syncookie to match the ones in bpf_tcp_gen_syncookie. IP
    version from the header is taken into account, and it is validated
    properly with address family.

    to skb_reserve(). However, build_skb() can fail under memory pressure.
    This results in a kernel panic because the skb to reserve is NULL.
    
    Add a check in case build_skb() failed to allocate and return NULL.
    
    The NULL return is handled correctly in callers to qede_build_skb().

    rxrpc: fix a race in rxrpc_exit_net()

    net: openvswitch: fix leak of nested actions
    
    [ Upstream commit 1f30fb9166d4f15a1aa19449b9da871fe0ed4796 ]
    
    While parsing user-provided actions, openvswitch module may dynamically
    allocate memory and store pointers in the internal copy of the actions.
    So this memory has to be freed while destroying the actions.
    
    Currently there are only two such actions: ct() and set().  However,
    there are many actions that can hold nested lists of actions and
    ovs_nla_free_flow_actions() just jumps over them leaking the memory.
    
    For example, removal of the flow with the following actions will lead
    to a leak of the memory allocated by nf_ct_tmpl_alloc():
    
      actions:clone(ct(commit),0)
    
    Non-freed set() action may also leak the 'dst' structure for the
    tunnel info including device references.
    
    Under certain conditions with a high rate of flow rotation that may
    cause significant memory leak problem (2MB per second in reporter's
    case).  The problem is also hard to mitigate, because the user doesn't
    have direct control over the datapath flows generated by OVS.
    
    Fix that by iterating over all the nested actions and freeing
    everything that needs to be freed recursively.
    
    New build time assertion should protect us from this problem if new
    actions will be added in the future.
    
    Unfortunately, openvswitch module doesn't use NLA_F_NESTED, so all
    attributes has to be explicitly checked.  sample() and clone() actions
    are mixing extra attributes into the user-provided action list.  That
    prevents some code generalization too.

    net: openvswitch: don't send internal clone attribute to the userspace.
    
    [ Upstream commit 3f2a3050b4a3e7f32fc0ea3c9b0183090ae00522 ]
    
    'OVS_CLONE_ATTR_EXEC' is an internal attribute that is used for
    performance optimization inside the kernel.  It's added by the kernel
    while parsing user-provided actions and should not be sent during the
    flow dump as it's not part of the uAPI.
    
    The issue doesn't cause any significant problems to the ovs-vswitchd
    process, because reported actions are not really used in the
    application lifecycle and only supposed to be shown to a human via
    ovs-dpctl flow dump.  However, the action list is still incorrect
    and causes the following error if the user wants to look at the
    datapath flows:
    
      # ovs-dpctl add-dp system@ovs-system
      # ovs-dpctl add-flow "<flow match>" "clone(ct(commit),0)"
      # ovs-dpctl dump-flows
      <flow match>, packets:0, bytes:0, used:never,
        actions:clone(bad length 4, expected -1 for: action0(01 00 00 00),
                      ct(commit),0)
    
    With the fix:
    
      # ovs-dpctl dump-flows
      <flow match>, packets:0, bytes:0, used:never,
        actions:clone(ct(commit),0)
    
    Additionally fixed an incorrect attribute name in the comment.

    ice: synchronize_rcu() when terminating rings
    
    [ Upstream commit f9124c68f05ffdb87a47e3ea6d5fae9dad7cb6eb ]
    
    Unfortunately, the ice driver doesn't respect the RCU critical section that

    paths that destroy resources that might be in use.

    ice: Do not skip not enabled queues in ice_vc_dis_qs_msg
    
    [ Upstream commit 05ef6813b234db3196f083b91db3963f040b65bb ]
    
    Disable check for queue being enabled in ice_vc_dis_qs_msg, because
    there could be a case when queues were created, but were not enabled.
    We still need to delete those queues.
    
    Normal workflow for VF looks like:
    Enable path:
    VIRTCHNL_OP_ADD_ETH_ADDR (opcode 10)
    VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES (opcode 6)
    VIRTCHNL_OP_ENABLE_QUEUES (opcode 8)
    
    Disable path:
    VIRTCHNL_OP_DISABLE_QUEUES (opcode 9)
    VIRTCHNL_OP_DEL_ETH_ADDR (opcode 11)
    
    The issue appears only in stress conditions when VF is enabled and
    disabled very fast.
    Eventually there will be a case, when queues are created by
    VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES, but are not enabled by
    VIRTCHNL_OP_ENABLE_QUEUES.
    In turn, these queues are not deleted by VIRTCHNL_OP_DISABLE_QUEUES,
    because there is a check whether queues are enabled in
    ice_vc_dis_qs_msg.
    
    When we bring up the VF again, we will see the "Failed to set LAN Tx queue
    context" error during VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES step. This
    happens because old 16 queues were not deleted and VF requests to create
    16 more, but ice_sched_get_free_qparent in ice_ena_vsi_txq would fail to
    find a parent node for first newly requested queue (because all nodes
    are allocated to 16 old queues).
    
    Testing Hints:
    
    Just enable and disable VF fast enough, so it would be disabled before
    reaching VIRTCHNL_OP_ENABLE_QUEUES.

    ice: Set txq_teid to ICE_INVAL_TEID on ring creation
    
    [ Upstream commit ccfee1822042b87e5135d33cad8ea353e64612d2 ]
    
    When VF is freshly created, but not brought up, ring->txq_teid
    value is by default set to 0.
    But 0 is a valid TEID. On some platforms the Root Node of
    Tx scheduler has a TEID = 0. This can cause issues as shown below.
    
    The proper way is to set ring->txq_teid to ICE_INVAL_TEID (0xFFFFFFFF).
    
    Testing Hints:
    echo 1 > /sys/class/net/ens785f0/device/sriov_numvfs
    ip link set dev ens785f0v0 up
    ip link set dev ens785f0v0 down
    
    If we have freshly created VF and quickly turn it on and off, so there
    would be no time to reach VIRTCHNL_OP_CONFIG_VSI_QUEUES stage, then
    VIRTCHNL_OP_DISABLE_QUEUES stage will fail with error:
    [  639.531454] disable queue 89 failed 14
    [  639.532233] Failed to disable LAN Tx queues, error: ICE_ERR_AQ_ERROR
    [  639.533107] ice 0000:02:00.0: Failed to stop Tx ring 0 on VSI 5
    
    The reason for the fail is that we are trying to send AQ command to
    delete queue 89, which has never been created and receive an "invalid
    argument" error from firmware.
    
    As this queue has never been created, it's teid and ring->txq_teid
    have default value 0.
    ice_dis_vsi_txq has a check against non-existent queues:
    
    node = ice_sched_find_node_by_teid(pi->root, q_teids[i]);
    if (!node)
            continue;
    
    But on some platforms the Root Node of Tx scheduler has a teid = 0.
    Hence, ice_sched_find_node_by_teid finds a node with teid = 0 (it is
    pi->root), and we go further to submit an erroneous request to firmware.

    IB/rdmavt: add lock to call to rvt_error_qp to prevent a race condition
    
    [ Upstream commit 4d809f69695d4e7d1378b3a072fa9aef23123018 ]
    
    The documentation of the function rvt_error_qp says both r_lock and s_lock
    need to be held when calling that function.  It also asserts using lockdep
    that both of those locks are held.  However, the commit I referenced in
    Fixes accidentally makes the call to rvt_error_qp in rvt_ruc_loopback no
    longer covered by r_lock.  This results in the lockdep assertion failing
    and also possibly in a race condition.

    net: stmmac: Fix unset max_speed difference between DT and non-DT platforms
    
    [ Upstream commit c21cabb0fd0b54b8b54235fc1ecfe1195a23bcb2 ]
    
    In commit 9cbadf094d9d ("net: stmmac: support max-speed device tree
    property"), when DT platforms don't set "max-speed", max_speed is set to
    -1; for non-DT platforms, it stays the default 0.
    
    Prior to commit eeef2f6b9f6e ("net: stmmac: Start adding phylink support"),
    the check for a valid max_speed setting was to check if it was greater
    than zero. This commit got it right, but subsequent patches just checked
    for non-zero, which is incorrect for DT platforms.
    
    In commit 92c3807b9ac3 ("net: stmmac: convert to phylink_get_linkmodes()")
    the conversion switched completely to checking for non-zero value as a
    valid value, which caused 1000base-T to stop getting advertised by
    default.
    
    Instead of trying to fix all the checks, simply leave max_speed alone if
    DT property parsing fails.

    net: ipv4: fix route with nexthop object delete warning
    
    [ Upstream commit 6bf92d70e690b7ff12b24f4bfff5e5434d019b82 ]
    
    FRR folks have hit a kernel warning[1] while deleting routes[2] which is
    caused by trying to delete a route pointing to a nexthop id without
    specifying nhid but matching on an interface. That is, a route is found
    but we hit a warning while matching it. The warning is from
    fib_info_nh() in include/net/nexthop.h because we run it on a fib_info
    with nexthop object. The call chain is:
     inet_rtm_delroute -> fib_table_delete -> fib_nh_match (called with a
    nexthop fib_info and also with fc_oif set thus calling fib_info_nh on
    the fib_info and triggering the warning). The fix is to not do any
    matching in that branch if the fi has a nexthop object because those are
    managed separately. I.e. we should match when deleting without nh spec and
    should fail when deleting a nexthop route with old-style nh spec because
    nexthop objects are managed separately, e.g.:
     $ ip r show 1.2.3.4/32
     1.2.3.4 nhid 12 via 192.168.11.2 dev dummy0
    
     $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32
     $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32 nhid 12
     <both should work>
    
     $ ip r del 1.2.3.4/32 dev dummy0
     <should fail with ESRCH>

    ice: Clear default forwarding VSI during VSI release
    
    [ Upstream commit bd8c624c0cd59de0032752ba3001c107bba97f7b ]
    
    VSI is set as default forwarding one when promisc mode is set for
    PF interface, when PF is switched to switchdev mode or when VF
    driver asks to enable allmulticast or promisc mode for the VF
    interface (when vf-true-promisc-support priv flag is off).
    The third case is buggy because in that case VSI associated with
    VF remains as default one after VF removal.
    
    Reproducer:
    1. Create VF
       echo 1 > sys/class/net/ens7f0/device/sriov_numvfs
    2. Enable allmulticast or promisc mode on VF
       ip link set ens7f0v0 allmulticast on
       ip link set ens7f0v0 promisc on
    3. Delete VF
       echo 0 > sys/class/net/ens7f0/device/sriov_numvfs
    4. Try to enable promisc mode on PF
       ip link set ens7f0 promisc on
    
    Although it looks that promisc mode on PF is enabled the opposite
    is true because ice_vsi_sync_fltr() responsible for IFF_PROMISC
    handling first checks if any other VSI is set as default forwarding
    one and if so the function does not do anything. At this point
    it is not possible to enable promisc mode on PF without re-probe
    device.
    
    To resolve the issue this patch clear default forwarding VSI
    during ice_vsi_release() when the VSI to be released is the default
    one.

    Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix potential crash on module unload
    
    [ Upstream commit 792f232d57ff28bbd5f9c4abe0466b23d5879dc8 ]
    
    The vmbus driver relies on the panic notifier infrastructure to perform
    some operations when a panic event is detected. Since vmbus can be built
    as module, it is required that the driver handles both registering and
    unregistering such panic notifier callback.
    
    After commit 74347a99e73a ("x86/Hyper-V: Unload vmbus channel in hv panic callback")
    though, the panic notifier registration is done unconditionally in the module
    initialization routine whereas the unregistering procedure is conditionally
    guarded and executes only if HV_FEATURE_GUEST_CRASH_MSR_AVAILABLE capability
    is set.
    
    This patch fixes that by unconditionally unregistering the panic notifier
    in the module's exit routine as well.

    mm: fix race between MADV_FREE reclaim and blkdev direct IO read
    
    commit 6c8e2a256915a223f6289f651d6b926cd7135c9e upstream.
    
    Problem:
    =======
    
    Userspace might read the zero-page instead of actual data from a direct IO
    read on a block device if the buffers have been called madvise(MADV_FREE)
    on earlier (this is discussed below) due to a race between page reclaim on
    MADV_FREE and blkdev direct IO read.
    
    - Race condition:
      ==============
    
    During page reclaim, the MADV_FREE page check in try_to_unmap_one() checks
    if the page is not dirty, then discards its rmap PTE(s) (vs.  remap back
    if the page is dirty).
    
    However, after try_to_unmap_one() returns to shrink_page_list(), it might
    keep the page _anyway_ if page_ref_freeze() fails (it expects exactly
    _one_ page reference, from the isolation for page reclaim).
    
    Well, blkdev_direct_IO() gets references for all pages, and on READ
    operations it only sets them dirty _later_.
    
    So, if MADV_FREE'd pages (i.e., not dirty) are used as buffers for direct
    IO read from block devices, and page reclaim happens during
    __blkdev_direct_IO[_simple]() exactly AFTER bio_iov_iter_get_pages()
    returns, but BEFORE the pages are set dirty, the situation happens.
    
    The direct IO read eventually completes.  Now, when userspace reads the
    buffers, the PTE is no longer there and the page fault handler
    do_anonymous_page() services that with the zero-page, NOT the data!
    
    A synthetic reproducer is provided.
    
    - Page faults:
      ===========
    
    If page reclaim happens BEFORE bio_iov_iter_get_pages() the issue doesn't
    happen, because that faults-in all pages as writeable, so
    do_anonymous_page() sets up a new page/rmap/PTE, and that is used by
    direct IO.  The userspace reads don't fault as the PTE is there (thus
    zero-page is not used/setup).
    
    But if page reclaim happens AFTER it / BEFORE setting pages dirty, the PTE
    is no longer there; the subsequent page faults can't help:
    
    The data-read from the block device probably won't generate faults due to
    DMA (no MMU) but even in the case it wouldn't use DMA, that happens on
    different virtual addresses (not user-mapped addresses) because `struct
    bio_vec` stores `struct page` to figure addresses out (which are different
    from user-mapped addresses) for the read.
    
    Thus userspace reads (to user-mapped addresses) still fault, then
    do_anonymous_page() gets another `struct page` that would address/ map to
    other memory than the `struct page` used by `struct bio_vec` for the read.
    (The original `struct page` is not available, since it wasn't freed, as
    page_ref_freeze() failed due to more page refs.  And even if it were
    available, its data cannot be trusted anymore.)
    
    Solution:
    ========
    
    One solution is to check for the expected page reference count in
    try_to_unmap_one().
    
    There should be one reference from the isolation (that is also checked in
    shrink_page_list() with page_ref_freeze()) plus one or more references
    from page mapping(s) (put in discard: label).  Further references mean
    that rmap/PTE cannot be unmapped/nuked.
    
    (Note: there might be more than one reference from mapping due to
    fork()/clone() without CLONE_VM, which use the same `struct page` for
    references, until the copy-on-write page gets copied.)
    
    So, additional page references (e.g., from direct IO read) now prevent the
    rmap/PTE from being unmapped/dropped; similarly to the page is not freed
    per shrink_page_list()/page_ref_freeze()).
    
    - Races and Barriers:
      ==================
    
    The new check in try_to_unmap_one() should be safe in races with
    bio_iov_iter_get_pages() in get_user_pages() fast and slow paths, as it's
    done under the PTE lock.
    
    The fast path doesn't take the lock, but it checks if the PTE has changed
    and if so, it drops the reference and leaves the page for the slow path
    (which does take that lock).
    
    The fast path requires synchronization w/ full memory barrier: it writes
    the page reference count first then it reads the PTE later, while
    try_to_unmap() writes PTE first then it reads page refcount.
    
    And a second barrier is needed, as the page dirty flag should not be read
    before the page reference count (as in __remove_mapping()).  (This can be
    a load memory barrier only; no writes are involved.)

    - Huge Pages:
      ==========
    
    Regarding transparent hugepages, that logic shouldn't change, as MADV_FREE
    (aka lazyfree) pages are PageAnon() && !PageSwapBacked()
    (madvise_free_pte_range() -> mark_page_lazyfree() -> lru_lazyfree_fn())
    thus should reach shrink_page_list() -> split_huge_page_to_list() before
    try_to_unmap[_one](), so it deals with normal pages only.
    
    (And in case unlikely/TTU_SPLIT_HUGE_PMD/split_huge_pmd_address() happens,
    which should not or be rare, the page refcount should be greater than
    mapcount: the head page is referenced by tail pages.  That also prevents
    checking the head `page` then incorrectly call page_remove_rmap(subpage)
    for a tail page, that isn't even in the shrink_page_list()'s page_list (an
    effect of split huge pmd/pmvw), as it might happen today in this unlikely
    scenario.)
    
    MADV_FREE'd buffers:
    ===================
    
    So, back to the "if MADV_FREE pages are used as buffers" note.  The case
    is arguable, and subject to multiple interpretations.
    
    The madvise(2) manual page on the MADV_FREE advice value says:
    
    1) 'After a successful MADV_FREE ... data will be lost when
       the kernel frees the pages.'
    2) 'the free operation will be canceled if the caller writes
       into the page' / 'subsequent writes ... will succeed and
       then [the] kernel cannot free those dirtied pages'
    3) 'If there is no subsequent write, the kernel can free the
       pages at any time.'
    
    Thoughts, questions, considerations... respectively:
    
    1) Since the kernel didn't actually free the page (page_ref_freeze()
       failed), should the data not have been lost? (on userspace read.)
    2) Should writes performed by the direct IO read be able to cancel
       the free operation?
       - Should the direct IO read be considered as 'the caller' too,
         as it's been requested by 'the caller'?
       - Should the bio technique to dirty pages on return to userspace
         (bio_check_pages_dirty() is called/used by __blkdev_direct_IO())
         be considered in another/special way here?
    3) Should an upcoming write from a previously requested direct IO
       read be considered as a subsequent write, so the kernel should
       not free the pages? (as it's known at the time of page reclaim.)
    
    And lastly:
    
    Technically, the last point would seem a reasonable consideration and
    balance, as the madvise(2) manual page apparently (and fairly) seem to
    assume that 'writes' are memory access from the userspace process (not
    explicitly considering writes from the kernel or its corner cases; again,
    fairly)..  plus the kernel fix implementation for the corner case of the
    largely 'non-atomic write' encompassed by a direct IO read operation, is
    relatively simple; and it helps.

    Ceph/TCMalloc:
    =============
    
    For documentation purposes, the use case driving the analysis/fix is Ceph
    on Ubuntu 18.04, as the TCMalloc library there still uses MADV_FREE to
    release unused memory to the system from the mmap'ed page heap (might be
    committed back/used again; it's not munmap'ed.) - PageHeap::DecommitSpan()
    -> TCMalloc_SystemRelease() -> madvise() - PageHeap::CommitSpan() ->
    TCMalloc_SystemCommit() -> do nothing.
    
    Note: TCMalloc switched back to MADV_DONTNEED a few commits after the
    release in Ubuntu 18.04 (google-perftools/gperftools 2.5), so the issue
    just 'disappeared' on Ceph on later Ubuntu releases but is still present
    in the kernel, and can be hit by other use cases.
    
    The observed issue seems to be the old Ceph bug #22464 [1], where checksum
    mismatches are observed (and instrumentation with buffer dumps shows
    zero-pages read from mmap'ed/MADV_FREE'd page ranges).
    
    The issue in Ceph was reasonably deemed a kernel bug (comment #50) and
    mostly worked around with a retry mechanism, but other parts of Ceph could
    still hit that (rocksdb).  Anyway, it's less likely to be hit again as
    TCMalloc switched out of MADV_FREE by default.
    
    (Some kernel versions/reports from the Ceph bug, and relation with
    the MADV_FREE introduction/changes; TCMalloc versions not checked.)
    - 4.4 good
    - 4.5 (madv_free: introduction)
    - 4.9 bad
    - 4.10 good? maybe a swapless system
    - 4.12 (madv_free: no longer free instantly on swapless systems)
    - 4.13 bad

    parisc: Fix patch code locking and flushing
    
    [ Upstream commit a9fe7fa7d874a536e0540469f314772c054a0323 ]
    
    This change fixes the following:
    
    1) The flags variable is not initialized. Always use raw_spin_lock_irqsave
    and raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore to serialize patching.
    
    2) flush_kernel_vmap_range is primarily intended for DMA flushes. Since
    __patch_text_multiple is often called with interrupts disabled, it is
    better to directly call flush_kernel_dcache_range_asm and
    flush_kernel_icache_range_asm. This avoids an extra call.
    
    3) The final call to flush_icache_range is unnecessary.

    jfs: prevent NULL deref in diFree
    
    [ Upstream commit a53046291020ec41e09181396c1e829287b48d47 ]
    
    Add validation check for JFS_IP(ipimap)->i_imap to prevent a NULL deref
    in diFree since diFree uses it without do any validations.
    When function jfs_mount calls diMount to initialize fileset inode
    allocation map, it can fail and JFS_IP(ipimap)->i_imap won't be
    initialized. Then it calls diFreeSpecial to close fileset inode allocation
    map inode and it will flow into jfs_evict_inode. Function jfs_evict_inode
    just validates JFS_SBI(inode->i_sb)->ipimap, then calls diFree. diFree use
    JFS_IP(ipimap)->i_imap directly, then it will cause a NULL deref.

    serial: samsung_tty: do not unlock port->lock for uart_write_wakeup()
    
    [ Upstream commit 988c7c00691008ea1daaa1235680a0da49dab4e8 ]
    
    The commit c15c3747ee32 (serial: samsung: fix potential soft lockup
    during uart write) added an unlock of port->lock before
    uart_write_wakeup() and a lock after it. It was always problematic to
    write data from tty_ldisc_ops::write_wakeup and it was even documented
    that way. We fixed the line disciplines to conform to this recently.
    So if there is still a missed one, we should fix them instead of this
    workaround.
    
    On the top of that, s3c24xx_serial_tx_dma_complete() in this driver
    still holds the port->lock while calling uart_write_wakeup().
    
    So revert the wrap added by the commit above.

    x86/Kconfig: Do not allow CONFIG_X86_X32_ABI=y with llvm-objcopy
    
    [ Upstream commit aaeed6ecc1253ce1463fa1aca0b70a4ccbc9fa75 ]
    
    There are two outstanding issues with CONFIG_X86_X32_ABI and
    llvm-objcopy, with similar root causes:
    
    1. llvm-objcopy does not properly convert .note.gnu.property when going
       from x86_64 to x86_x32, resulting in a corrupted section when
       linking:
    
       https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/1141
    
    2. llvm-objcopy produces corrupted compressed debug sections when going
       from x86_64 to x86_x32, also resulting in an error when linking:
    
       https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/linux/issues/514
    
    After commit 41c5ef31ad71 ("x86/ibt: Base IBT bits"), the
    .note.gnu.property section is always generated when
    CONFIG_X86_KERNEL_IBT is enabled, which causes the first issue to become
    visible with an allmodconfig build:
    
      ld.lld: error: arch/x86/entry/vdso/vclock_gettime-x32.o:(.note.gnu.property+0x1c): program property is too short
    
    To avoid this error, do not allow CONFIG_X86_X32_ABI to be selected when
    using llvm-objcopy. If the two issues ever get fixed in llvm-objcopy,
    this can be turned into a feature check.

    NFS: swap-out must always use STABLE writes.
    
    [ Upstream commit c265de257f558a05c1859ee9e3fed04883b9ec0e ]
    
    The commit handling code is not safe against memory-pressure deadlocks
    when writing to swap.  In particular, nfs_commitdata_alloc() blocks
    indefinitely waiting for memory, and this can consume all available
    workqueue threads.
    
    swap-out most likely uses STABLE writes anyway as COND_STABLE indicates
    that a stable write should be used if the write fits in a single
    request, and it normally does.  However if we ever swap with a small
    wsize, or gather unusually large numbers of pages for a single write,
    this might change.
    
    For safety, make it explicit in the code that direct writes used for swap
    must always use FLUSH_STABLE.

    NFS: swap IO handling is slightly different for O_DIRECT IO
    
    [ Upstream commit 64158668ac8b31626a8ce48db4cad08496eb8340 ]
    
    1/ Taking the i_rwsem for swap IO triggers lockdep warnings regarding
       possible deadlocks with "fs_reclaim".  These deadlocks could, I believe,
       eventuate if a buffered read on the swapfile was attempted.
    
       We don't need coherence with the page cache for a swap file, and
       buffered writes are forbidden anyway.  There is no other need for
       i_rwsem during direct IO.  So never take it for swap_rw()
    
    2/ generic_write_checks() explicitly forbids writes to swap, and
       performs checks that are not needed for swap.  So bypass it
       for swap_rw().

    SUNRPC: remove scheduling boost for "SWAPPER" tasks.
    
    [ Upstream commit a80a8461868905823609be97f91776a26befe839 ]

    enabled on *any* file are marked as "swapper" tasks.  So the net result
    is that the non-priority rpc_queues are reverse-ordered (LIFO).
    
    This scheduling boost is not necessary to avoid deadlocks, and hurts
    fairness, so remove it.  If there were a need to expedite some requests,
    the tk_priority mechanism is a more appropriate tool.

    SUNRPC/xprt: async tasks mustn't block waiting for memory
    
    [ Upstream commit a721035477fb5fb8abc738fbe410b07c12af3dc5 ]
    
    When memory is short, new worker threads cannot be created and we depend
    on the minimum one rpciod thread to be able to handle everything.  So it
    must not block waiting for memory.
    
    xprt_dynamic_alloc_slot can block indefinitely.  This can tie up all
    workqueue threads and NFS can deadlock.  So when called from a
    workqueue, set __GFP_NORETRY.
    
    The rdma alloc_slot already does not block.  However it sets the error
    to -EAGAIN suggesting this will trigger a sleep.  It does not.  As we
    can see in call_reserveresult(), only -ENOMEM causes a sleep.  -EAGAIN
    causes immediate retry.

    SUNRPC/call_alloc: async tasks mustn't block waiting for memory
    
    [ Upstream commit c487216bec83b0c5a8803e5c61433d33ad7b104d ]
    
    When memory is short, new worker threads cannot be created and we depend
    on the minimum one rpciod thread to be able to handle everything.
    So it must not block waiting for memory.
    
    mempools are particularly a problem as memory can only be released back
    to the mempool by an async rpc task running.  If all available
    workqueue threads are waiting on the mempool, no thread is available to
    return anything.
    
    rpc_malloc() can block, and this might cause deadlocks.
    So check RPC_IS_ASYNC(), rather than RPC_IS_SWAPPER() to determine if
    blocking is acceptable.

    clk: Enforce that disjoints limits are invalid
    
    [ Upstream commit 10c46f2ea914202482d19cf80dcc9c321c9ff59b ]
    
    If we were to have two users of the same clock, doing something like:
    
    clk_set_rate_range(user1, 1000, 2000);
    clk_set_rate_range(user2, 3000, 4000);
    
    The second call would fail with -EINVAL, preventing from getting in a
    situation where we end up with impossible limits.
    
    However, this is never explicitly checked against and enforced, and
    works by relying on an undocumented behaviour of clk_set_rate().
    
    Indeed, on the first clk_set_rate_range will make sure the current clock
    rate is within the new range, so it will be between 1000 and 2000Hz. On
    the second clk_set_rate_range(), it will consider (rightfully), that our
    current clock is outside of the 3000-4000Hz range, and will call
    clk_core_set_rate_nolock() to set it to 3000Hz.
    
    clk_core_set_rate_nolock() will then call clk_calc_new_rates() that will
    eventually check that our rate 3000Hz rate is outside the min 3000Hz max
    2000Hz range, will bail out, the error will propagate and we'll
    eventually return -EINVAL.
    
    This solely relies on the fact that clk_calc_new_rates(), and in
    particular clk_core_determine_round_nolock(), won't modify the new rate
    allowing the error to be reported. That assumption won't be true for all
    drivers, and most importantly we'll break that assumption in a later
    patch.
    
    It can also be argued that we shouldn't even reach the point where we're
    calling clk_core_set_rate_nolock().
    
    Let's make an explicit check for disjoints range before we're doing
    anything.

    xen: delay xen_hvm_init_time_ops() if kdump is boot on vcpu>=32
    
    [ Upstream commit eed05744322da07dd7e419432dcedf3c2e017179 ]
    
    The sched_clock() can be used very early since commit 857baa87b642
    ("sched/clock: Enable sched clock early"). In addition, with commit
    38669ba205d1 ("x86/xen/time: Output xen sched_clock time from 0"), kdump
    kernel in Xen HVM guest may panic at very early stage when accessing
    &__this_cpu_read(xen_vcpu)->time as in below:
    
    setup_arch()
     -> init_hypervisor_platform()
         -> x86_init.hyper.init_platform = xen_hvm_guest_init()
             -> xen_hvm_init_time_ops()
                 -> xen_clocksource_read()
                     -> src = &__this_cpu_read(xen_vcpu)->time;
    
    This is because Xen HVM supports at most MAX_VIRT_CPUS=32 'vcpu_info'
    embedded inside 'shared_info' during early stage until xen_vcpu_setup() is
    used to allocate/relocate 'vcpu_info' for boot cpu at arbitrary address.
    
    However, when Xen HVM guest panic on vcpu >= 32, since
    xen_vcpu_info_reset(0) would set per_cpu(xen_vcpu, cpu) = NULL when
    vcpu >= 32, xen_clocksource_read() on vcpu >= 32 would panic.
    
    This patch calls xen_hvm_init_time_ops() again later in
    xen_hvm_smp_prepare_boot_cpu() after the 'vcpu_info' for boot vcpu is
    registered when the boot vcpu is >= 32.
    
    This issue can be reproduced on purpose via below command at the guest
    side when kdump/kexec is enabled:
    
    "taskset -c 33 echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger"
    
    The bugfix for PVM is not implemented due to the lack of testing
    environment.

    NFSv4.2: fix reference count leaks in _nfs42_proc_copy_notify()

    [You don't often get email from xiongx18@fudan.edu.cn. Learn why this is important at http://aka.ms/LearnAboutSenderIdentification.]
    
    The reference counting issue happens in two error paths in the
    function _nfs42_proc_copy_notify(). In both error paths, the function
    simply returns the error code and forgets to balance the refcount of
    object `ctx`, bumped by get_nfs_open_context() earlier, which may
    cause refcount leaks.
    
    Fix it by balancing refcount of the `ctx` object before the function
    returns in both error paths.

    Testcase:

    3. open fails with -EINVAL but leaves an empty file behind. All other
       open() failures don't leave the failed open files behind.
    
    It is hard to check the direct_IO op before creating the inode.  Just as
    ext4 and btrfs do, this patch will resolve the issue by allowing to
    create the file with O_DIRECT but returning error when writing the file.

    Bluetooth: Fix use after free in hci_send_acl
    
    [ Upstream commit f63d24baff787e13b723d86fe036f84bdbc35045 ]
    
    This fixes the following trace caused by receiving
    HCI_EV_DISCONN_PHY_LINK_COMPLETE which does call hci_conn_del without
    first checking if conn->type is in fact AMP_LINK and in case it is
    do properly cleanup upper layers with hci_disconn_cfm:

    net: limit altnames to 64k total
    
    [ Upstream commit 155fb43b70b5fce341347a77d1af2765d1e8fbb8 ]
    
    Property list (altname is a link "property") is wrapped
    in a nlattr. nlattrs length is 16bit so practically
    speaking the list of properties can't be longer than
    that, otherwise user space would have to interpret
    broken netlink messages.
    
    Prevent the problem from occurring by checking the length
    of the property list before adding new entries.

    can: isotp: set default value for N_As to 50 micro seconds
    
    [ Upstream commit 530e0d46c61314c59ecfdb8d3bcb87edbc0f85d3 ]
    
    The N_As value describes the time a CAN frame needs on the wire when
    transmitted by the CAN controller. Even very short CAN FD frames need
    arround 100 usecs (bitrate 1Mbit/s, data bitrate 8Mbit/s).
    
    Having N_As to be zero (the former default) leads to 'no CAN frame
    separation' when STmin is set to zero by the receiving node. This 'burst
    mode' should not be enabled by default as it could potentially dump a high
    number of CAN frames into the netdev queue from the soft hrtimer context.
    This does not affect the system stability but is just not nice and
    cooperative.
    
    With this N_As/frame_txtime value the 'burst mode' is disabled by default.
    
    As user space applications usually do not set the frame_txtime element
    of struct can_isotp_options the new in-kernel default is very likely
    overwritten with zero when the sockopt() CAN_ISOTP_OPTS is invoked.
    To make sure that a N_As value of zero is only set intentional the
    value '0' is now interpreted as 'do not change the current value'.
    When a frame_txtime of zero is required for testing purposes this
    CAN_ISOTP_FRAME_TXTIME_ZERO u32 value has to be set in frame_txtime.

    fc_exch_release(ep) will decrease the ep's reference count. When the
    reference count reaches zero, it is freed. But ep is still used in the
    following code, which will lead to a use after free.
    
    Return after the fc_exch_release() call to avoid use after free.

    MIPS: fix fortify panic when copying asm exception handlers
    
    [ Upstream commit d17b66417308996e7e64b270a3c7f3c1fbd4cfc8 ]
    
    With KCFLAGS="-O3", I was able to trigger a fortify-source
    memcpy() overflow panic on set_vi_srs_handler().
    Although O3 level is not supported in the mainline, under some
    conditions that may've happened with any optimization settings,
    it's just a matter of inlining luck. The panic itself is correct,
    more precisely, 50/50 false-positive and not at the same time.
    From the one side, no real overflow happens. Exception handler
    defined in asm just gets copied to some reserved places in the
    memory.
    But the reason behind is that C code refers to that exception
    handler declares it as `char`, i.e. something of 1 byte length.
    It's obvious that the asm function itself is way more than 1 byte,
    so fortify logics thought we are going to past the symbol declared.
    The standard way to refer to asm symbols from C code which is not
    supposed to be called from C is to declare them as
    `extern const u8[]`. This is fully correct from any point of view,
    as any code itself is just a bunch of bytes (including 0 as it is
    for syms like _stext/_etext/etc.), and the exact size is not known
    at the moment of compilation.
    Adjust the type of the except_vec_vi_*() and related variables.
    Make set_handler() take `const` as a second argument to avoid
    cast-away warnings and give a little more room for optimization.

    bnxt_en: Eliminate unintended link toggle during FW reset
    
    [ Upstream commit 7c492a2530c1f05441da541307c2534230dfd59b ]
    
    If the flow control settings have been changed, a subsequent FW reset
    may cause the ethernet link to toggle unnecessarily.  This link toggle
    will increase the down time by a few seconds.
    
    The problem is caused by bnxt_update_phy_setting() detecting a false
    mismatch in the flow control settings between the stored software
    settings and the current FW settings after the FW reset.  This mismatch
    is caused by the AUTONEG bit added to link_info->req_flow_ctrl in an
    inconsistent way in bnxt_set_pauseparam() in autoneg mode.  The AUTONEG
    bit should not be added to link_info->req_flow_ctrl.

    net/smc: correct settings of RMB window update limit
    
    [ Upstream commit 6bf536eb5c8ca011d1ff57b5c5f7c57ceac06a37 ]
    
    rmbe_update_limit is used to limit announcing receive
    window updating too frequently. RFC7609 request a minimal
    increase in the window size of 10% of the receive buffer
    space. But current implementation used:
    
      min_t(int, rmbe_size / 10, SOCK_MIN_SNDBUF / 2)
    
    and SOCK_MIN_SNDBUF / 2 == 2304 Bytes, which is almost
    always less then 10% of the receive buffer space.
    
    This causes the receiver always sending CDC message to
    update its consumer cursor when it consumes more then 2K
    of data. And as a result, we may encounter something like
    "TCP silly window syndrome" when sending 2.5~8K message.
    
    This patch fixes this using max(rmbe_size / 10, SOCK_MIN_SNDBUF / 2).
    
    With this patch and SMC autocorking enabled, qperf 2K/4K/8K
    tcp_bw test shows 45%/75%/40% increase in throughput respectively.

    If the driver probe fails to request the channel IRQ or fatal IRQ, the
    driver will free the IRQ vectors before freeing the IRQs in free_irq(),

    [ Upstream commit 7e6b7e740addcea450041b5be8e42f0a4ceece0f ]
    
    The call to pm8001_ccb_task_free() at the end of
    pm8001_mpi_task_abort_resp() already frees the ccb tag. So when the device
    NCQ_ABORT_ALL_FLAG is set, the tag should not be freed again.  Also change
    the hardcoded 0xBFFFFFFF value to ~NCQ_ABORT_ALL_FLAG as it ought to be.

    scsi: pm8001: Fix pm80xx_pci_mem_copy() interface
    
    [ Upstream commit 3762d8f6edcdb03994c919f9487fd6d336c06561 ]
    
    The declaration of the local variable destination1 in pm80xx_pci_mem_copy()
    as a pointer to a u32 results in the sparse warning:
    
    warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
        expected unsigned int [usertype]
        got restricted __le32 [usertype]
    
    Furthermore, the destination" argument of pm80xx_pci_mem_copy() is wrongly
    declared with the const attribute.
    
    Fix both problems by changing the type of the "destination" argument to
    "__le32 *" and use this argument directly inside the pm80xx_pci_mem_copy()
    function, thus removing the need for the destination1 local variable.

    ipv4: Invalidate neighbour for broadcast address upon address addition
    
    [ Upstream commit 0c51e12e218f20b7d976158fdc18019627326f7a ]
    
    In case user space sends a packet destined to a broadcast address when a
    matching broadcast route is not configured, the kernel will create a
    unicast neighbour entry that will never be resolved [1].
    
    When the broadcast route is configured, the unicast neighbour entry will
    not be invalidated and continue to linger, resulting in packets being
    dropped.
    
    Solve this by invalidating unresolved neighbour entries for broadcast
    addresses after routes for these addresses are internally configured by
    the kernel. This allows the kernel to create a broadcast neighbour entry
    following the next route lookup.
    
    Another possible solution that is more generic but also more complex is
    to have the ARP code register a listener to the FIB notification chain
    and invalidate matching neighbour entries upon the addition of broadcast
    routes.
    
    It is also possible to wave off the issue as a user space problem, but
    it seems a bit excessive to expect user space to be that intimately
    familiar with the inner workings of the FIB/neighbour kernel code.

    power: supply: axp288-charger: Set Vhold to 4.4V
    
    [ Upstream commit 5ac121b81b4051e7fc83d5b3456a5e499d5bd147 ]
    
    The AXP288's recommended and factory default Vhold value (minimum
    input voltage below which the input current draw will be reduced)
    is 4.4V. This lines up with other charger IC's such as the TI
    bq2419x/bq2429x series which use 4.36V or 4.44V.
    
    For some reason some BIOS-es initialize Vhold to 4.6V or even 4.7V
    which combined with the typical voltage drop over typically low
    wire gauge micro-USB cables leads to the input-current getting
    capped below 1A (with a 2A capable dedicated charger) based on Vhold.
    
    This leads to slow charging, or even to the device slowly discharging
    if the device is in heavy use.
    
    As the Linux AXP288 drivers use the builtin BC1.2 charger detection
    and send the input-current-limit according to the detected charger
    there really is no reason not to use the recommended 4.4V Vhold.
    
    Set Vhold to 4.4V to fix the slow charging issue on various devices.
    
    There is one exception, the special-case of the HP X2 2-in-1s which
    combine this BC1.2 capable PMIC with a Type-C port and a 5V/3A factory
    provided charger with a Type-C plug which does not do BC1.2. These
    have their input-current-limit hardcoded to 3A (like under Windows)
    and use a higher Vhold on purpose to limit the current when used
    with other chargers. To avoid touching Vhold on these HP X2 laptops
    the code setting Vhold is added to an else branch of the if checking
    for these models.
    
    Note this also fixes the sofar unused VBUS_ISPOUT_VHOLD_SET_MASK
    define, which was wrong.

    Add the device to the Command Completed quirk to mark commands "completed"
    immediately unless they change the "Control" bits.

    tcp: Don't acquire inet_listen_hashbucket::lock with disabled BH.
    
    [ Upstream commit 4f9bf2a2f5aacf988e6d5e56b961ba45c5a25248 ]
    
    Commit
       9652dc2eb9e40 ("tcp: relax listening_hash operations")
    
    removed the need to disable bottom half while acquiring
    listening_hash.lock. There are still two callers left which disable
    bottom half before the lock is acquired.
    
    On PREEMPT_RT the softirqs are preemptible and local_bh_disable() acts
    as a lock to ensure that resources, that are protected by disabling
    bottom halves, remain protected.
    This leads to a circular locking dependency if the lock acquired with
    disabled bottom halves is also acquired with enabled bottom halves
    followed by disabling bottom halves. This is the reverse locking order.
    It has been observed with inet_listen_hashbucket::lock:
    
    local_bh_disable() + spin_lock(&ilb->lock):
      inet_listen()
        inet_csk_listen_start()
          sk->sk_prot->hash() := inet_hash()
            local_bh_disable()
            __inet_hash()
              spin_lock(&ilb->lock);
                acquire(&ilb->lock);
    
    Reverse order: spin_lock(&ilb2->lock) + local_bh_disable():
      tcp_seq_next()
        listening_get_next()
          spin_lock(&ilb2->lock);
            acquire(&ilb2->lock);
    
      tcp4_seq_show()
        get_tcp4_sock()
          sock_i_ino()
            read_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock);
              acquire(softirq_ctrl) // <---- whoops
              acquire(&sk->sk_callback_lock)
    
    Drop local_bh_disable() around __inet_hash() which acquires
    listening_hash->lock. Split inet_unhash() and acquire the
    listen_hashbucket lock without disabling bottom halves; the inet_ehash
    lock with disabled bottom halves.

    PCI: endpoint: Fix alignment fault error in copy tests
    
    [ Upstream commit 829cc0e2ea2d61fb6c54bc3f8a17f86c56e11864 ]
    
    The copy test uses the memcpy() to copy data between IO memory spaces.
    This can trigger an alignment fault error (pasted the error logs below)
    because memcpy() may use unaligned accesses on a mapped memory that is
    just IO, which does not support unaligned memory accesses.
    
    Fix it by using the correct memcpy API to copy from/to IO memory.

    PCI: aardvark: Fix support for MSI interrupts
    
    [ Upstream commit b0b0b8b897f8e12b2368e868bd7cdc5742d5c5a9 ]
    
    Aardvark hardware supports Multi-MSI and MSI_FLAG_MULTI_PCI_MSI is already
    set for the MSI chip. But when allocating MSI interrupt numbers for
    Multi-MSI, the numbers need to be properly aligned, otherwise endpoint
    devices send MSI interrupt with incorrect numbers.
    
    Fix this issue by using function bitmap_find_free_region() instead of
    bitmap_find_next_zero_area().
    
    To ensure that aligned MSI interrupt numbers are used by endpoint devices,
    we cannot use Linux virtual irq numbers (as they are random and not
    properly aligned). Instead we need to use the aligned hwirq numbers.
    
    This change fixes receiving MSI interrupts on Armada 3720 boards and
    allows using NVMe disks which use Multi-MSI feature with 3 interrupts.
    
    Without this NVMe disks freeze booting as linux nvme-core.c is waiting
    60s for an interrupt.

    powerpc: Set crashkernel offset to mid of RMA region
    
    [ Upstream commit 7c5ed82b800d8615cdda00729e7b62e5899f0b13 ]
    
    On large config LPARs (having 192 and more cores), Linux fails to boot
    due to insufficient memory in the first memblock. It is due to the
    memory reservation for the crash kernel which starts at 128MB offset of
    the first memblock. This memory reservation for the crash kernel doesn't
    leave enough space in the first memblock to accommodate other essential
    system resources.
    
    The crash kernel start address was set to 128MB offset by default to
    ensure that the crash kernel get some memory below the RMA region which
    is used to be of size 256MB. But given that the RMA region size can be
    512MB or more, setting the crash kernel offset to mid of RMA size will
    leave enough space for the kernel to allocate memory for other system
    resources.
    
    Since the above crash kernel offset change is only applicable to the LPAR
    platform, the LPAR feature detection is pushed before the crash kernel
    reservation. The rest of LPAR specific initialization will still
    be done during pseries_probe_fw_features as usual.
    
    This patch is dependent on changes to paca allocation for boot CPU. It
    expect boot CPU to discover 1T segment support which is introduced by
    the patch posted here:

    libbpf: Fix build issue with llvm-readelf
    
    [ Upstream commit 0908a66ad1124c1634c33847ac662106f7f2c198 ]
    
    There are cases where clang compiler is packaged in a way
    readelf is a symbolic link to llvm-readelf. In such cases,
    llvm-readelf will be used instead of default binutils readelf,
    and the following error will appear during libbpf build:
    
    #  Warning: Num of global symbols in

    The above failure is due to different printouts for some ABS
    versioned symbols. For example, with the same libbpf.so,
      $ /bin/readelf --dyn-syms --wide tools/lib/bpf/libbpf.so | grep "LIBBPF" | grep ABS
         134: 0000000000000000     0 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT  ABS LIBBPF_0.5.0
         202: 0000000000000000     0 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT  ABS LIBBPF_0.6.0
         ...
      $ /opt/llvm/bin/readelf --dyn-syms --wide tools/lib/bpf/libbpf.so | grep "LIBBPF" | grep ABS
         134: 0000000000000000     0 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT   ABS LIBBPF_0.5.0@@LIBBPF_0.5.0
         202: 0000000000000000     0 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT   ABS LIBBPF_0.6.0@@LIBBPF_0.6.0
         ...
    The binutils readelf doesn't print out the symbol LIBBPF_* version and llvm-readelf does.
    Such a difference caused libbpf build failure with llvm-readelf.
    
    The proposed fix filters out all ABS symbols as they are not part of the comparison.
    This works for both binutils readelf and llvm-readelf.

    power: supply: axp20x_battery: properly report current when discharging
    
    [ Upstream commit d4f408cdcd26921c1268cb8dcbe8ffb6faf837f3 ]
    
    As stated in [1], negative current values are used for discharging
    batteries.
    
    AXP PMICs internally have two different ADC channels for shunt current
    measurement: one used during charging and one during discharging.
    The values reported by these ADCs are unsigned.
    While the driver properly selects ADC channel to get the data from,
    it doesn't apply negative sign when reporting discharging current.

    bpf: Make dst_port field in struct bpf_sock 16-bit wide
    
    [ Upstream commit 4421a582718ab81608d8486734c18083b822390d ]
    
    Menglong Dong reports that the documentation for the dst_port field in
    struct bpf_sock is inaccurate and confusing. From the BPF program PoV, the
    field is a zero-padded 16-bit integer in network byte order. The value
    appears to the BPF user as if laid out in memory as so:
    
      offsetof(struct bpf_sock, dst_port) + 0  <port MSB>
                                          + 8  <port LSB>
                                          +16  0x00
                                          +24  0x00
    
    32-, 16-, and 8-bit wide loads from the field are all allowed, but only if
    the offset into the field is 0.
    
    32-bit wide loads from dst_port are especially confusing. The loaded value,
    after converting to host byte order with bpf_ntohl(dst_port), contains the
    port number in the upper 16-bits.
    
    Remove the confusion by splitting the field into two 16-bit fields. For
    backward compatibility, allow 32-bit wide loads from offsetof(struct
    bpf_sock, dst_port).
    
    While at it, allow loads 8-bit loads at offset [0] and [1] from dst_port.

    ath11k: mhi: use mhi_sync_power_up()
    
    [ Upstream commit 3df6d74aedfdca919cca475d15dfdbc8b05c9e5d ]
    
    If amss.bin was missing ath11k would crash during 'rmmod ath11k_pci'. The
    reason for that was that we were using mhi_async_power_up() which does not
    check any errors. But mhi_sync_power_up() on the other hand does check for
    errors so let's use that to fix the crash.
    
    I was not able to find a reason why an async version was used.
    ath11k_mhi_start() (which enables state ATH11K_MHI_POWER_ON) is called from
    ath11k_hif_power_up(), which can sleep. So sync version should be safe to use
    here.

    This issue takes place in an error path in

    For allow eDP hot-plug feature, the stream signal may change to VIRTUAL
    when plug-out and back to eDP when plug-in. OS will still setPathMode
    with same timing for each plugging, but eDP gets no stream update as we
    don't check signal type changing back as keeping it VIRTUAL. It's also
    unsafe for future cases that stream signal is switched with same timing.
    
    [How]
    Check stream signal type change include previous HDMI signal case.

    ath5k: fix OOB in ath5k_eeprom_read_pcal_info_5111
    
    [ Upstream commit 564d4eceb97eaf381dd6ef6470b06377bb50c95a ]
    
    The bug was found during fuzzing. Stacktrace locates it in
    ath5k_eeprom_convert_pcal_info_5111.
    When none of the curve is selected in the loop, idx can go
    up to AR5K_EEPROM_N_PD_CURVES. The line makes pd out of bound.
    pd = &chinfo[pier].pd_curves[idx];
    
    There are many OOB writes using pd later in the code. So I
    added a sanity check for idx. Checks for other loops involving
    AR5K_EEPROM_N_PD_CURVES are not needed as the loop index is not
    used outside the loops.
    
    The patch is NOT tested with real device.
    
    The following is the fuzzing report

    KVM: x86/svm: Clear reserved bits written to PerfEvtSeln MSRs
    
    [ Upstream commit 9b026073db2f1ad0e4d8b61c83316c8497981037 ]
    
    AMD EPYC CPUs never raise a #GP for a WRMSR to a PerfEvtSeln MSR. Some
    reserved bits are cleared, and some are not. Specifically, on
    Zen3/Milan, bits 19 and 42 are not cleared.
    
    When emulating such a WRMSR, KVM should not synthesize a #GP,
    regardless of which bits are set. However, undocumented bits should
    not be passed through to the hardware MSR. So, rather than checking
    for reserved bits and synthesizing a #GP, just clear the reserved
    bits.
    
    This may seem pedantic, but since KVM currently does not support the
    "Host/Guest Only" bits (41:40), it is necessary to clear these bits
    rather than synthesizing #GP, because some popular guests (e.g Linux)
    will set the "Host Only" bit even on CPUs that don't support
    EFER.SVME, and they don't expect a #GP.

    gfs2: gfs2_setattr_size error path fix
    
    [ Upstream commit 7336905a89f19173bf9301cd50a24421162f417c ]
    
    When gfs2_setattr_size() fails, it calls gfs2_rs_delete(ip, NULL) to get
    rid of any reservations the inode may have.  Instead, it should pass in
    the inode's write count as the second parameter to allow
    gfs2_rs_delete() to figure out if the inode has any writers left.
    
    In a next step, there are two instances of gfs2_rs_delete(ip, NULL) left
    where we know that there can be no other users of the inode.  Replace
    those with gfs2_rs_deltree(&ip->i_res) to avoid the unnecessary write
    count check.
    
    With that, gfs2_rs_delete() is only called with the inode's actual write
    count, so get rid of the second parameter.

    gfs2: Fix gfs2_release for non-writers regression
    
    [ Upstream commit d3add1a9519dcacd6e644ecac741c56cf18b67f5 ]
    
    When a file is opened for writing, the vfs code (do_dentry_open)
    calls get_write_access for the inode, thus incrementing the inode's write
    count. That writer normally then creates a multi-block reservation for
    the inode (i_res) that can be re-used by other writers, which speeds up
    writes for applications that stupidly loop on open/write/close.
    When the writes are all done, the multi-block reservation should be
    deleted when the file is closed by the last "writer."
    
    Commit 0ec9b9ea4f83 broke that concept when it moved the call to
    gfs2_rs_delete before the check for FMODE_WRITE.  Non-writers have no
    business removing the multi-block reservations of writers. In fact, if
    someone opens and closes the file for RO while a writer has a
    multi-block reservation, the RO closer will delete the reservation
    midway through the write, and this results in:
    
    kernel BUG at fs/gfs2/rgrp.c:677! (or thereabouts) which is:
    BUG_ON(rs->rs_requested); from function gfs2_rs_deltree.
    
    This patch moves the check back inside the check for FMODE_WRITE.

    ubifs: Rectify space amount budget for mkdir/tmpfile operations
    
    [ Upstream commit a6dab6607d4681d227905d5198710b575dbdb519 ]
    
    UBIFS should make sure the flash has enough space to store dirty (Data
    that is newer than disk) data (in memory), space budget is exactly
    designed to do that. If space budget calculates less data than we need,
    'make_reservation()' will do more work(return -ENOSPC if no free space
    lelf, sometimes we can see "cannot reserve xxx bytes in jhead xxx, error
    -28" in ubifs error messages) with ubifs inodes locked, which may effect
    other syscalls.
    
    A simple way to decide how much space do we need when make a budget:
    See how much space is needed by 'make_reservation()' in ubifs_jnl_xxx()
    function according to corresponding operation.
    
    It's better to report ENOSPC in ubifs_budget_space(), as early as we can.
