    Revert "f2fs: fix to do sanity check on direct node in truncate_dnode()"
    
    This reverts commit a78a8bcdc26de5ef3a0ee27c9c6c512e54a6051c which is
    commit a6ec83786ab9f13f25fb18166dee908845713a95 upstream.
    
    Something is currently broken in the f2fs code, Guenter has reported
    boot problems with it for a few releases now, so revert the most recent
    f2fs changes in the hope to get this back to a working filesystem.

    objtool/x86: Fix SRSO mess
    
    commit 4ae68b26c3ab5a82aa271e6e9fc9b1a06e1d6b40 upstream.
    
    Objtool --rethunk does two things:
    
     - it collects all (tail) call's of __x86_return_thunk and places them
       into .return_sites. These are typically compiler generated, but
       RET also emits this same.
    
     - it fudges the validation of the __x86_return_thunk symbol; because
       this symbol is inside another instruction, it can't actually find
       the instruction pointed to by the symbol offset and gets upset.
    
    Because these two things pertained to the same symbol, there was no
    pressing need to separate these two separate things.
    
    However, alas, along comes SRSO and more crazy things to deal with
    appeared.
    
    The SRSO patch itself added the following symbol names to identify as
    rethunk:
    
      'srso_untrain_ret', 'srso_safe_ret' and '__ret'
    
    Where '__ret' is the old retbleed return thunk, 'srso_safe_ret' is a
    new similarly embedded return thunk, and 'srso_untrain_ret' is
    completely unrelated to anything the above does (and was only included
    because of that INT3 vs UD2 issue fixed previous).
    
    Clear things up by adding a second category for the embedded instruction
    thing.
