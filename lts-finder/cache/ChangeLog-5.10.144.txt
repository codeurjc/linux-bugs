    soc: fsl: select FSL_GUTS driver for DPIO
    
    commit 9a472613f5bccf1b36837423495ae592a9c5182f upstream.
    
    The soc/fsl/dpio driver will perform a soc_device_match()
    to determine the optimal cache settings for a given CPU core.
    
    If FSL_GUTS is not enabled, this search will fail and
    the driver will not configure cache stashing for the given
    DPIO, and a string of "unknown SoC" messages will appear:
    
    fsl_mc_dpio dpio.7: unknown SoC version
    fsl_mc_dpio dpio.6: unknown SoC version
    fsl_mc_dpio dpio.5: unknown SoC version

    x86/ibt,ftrace: Make function-graph play nice
    
    commit e52fc2cf3f662828cc0d51c4b73bed73ad275fce upstream.
    
    Return trampoline must not use indirect branch to return; while this
    preserves the RSB, it is fundamentally incompatible with IBT. Instead
    use a retpoline like ROP gadget that defeats IBT while not unbalancing
    the RSB.
    
    And since ftrace_stub is no longer a plain RET, don't use it to copy
    from. Since RET is a trivial instruction, poke it directly.

    This temporarily reverts the backport of upstream commit
    1f001e9da6bbf482311e45e48f53c2bd2179e59c. It was not correct to copy the
    ftrace stub as it would contain a relative jump to the return thunk which
    would not apply to the context where it was being copied to, leading to
    ftrace support to be broken.

    mm: Fix TLB flush for not-first PFNMAP mappings in unmap_region()
    
    This is a stable-specific patch.
    I botched the stable-specific rewrite of
    commit b67fbebd4cf98 ("mmu_gather: Force tlb-flush VM_PFNMAP vmas"):
    As Hugh pointed out, unmap_region() actually operates on a list of VMAs,
    and the variable "vma" merely points to the first VMA in that list.
    So if we want to check whether any of the VMAs we're operating on is
    PFNMAP or MIXEDMAP, we have to iterate through the list and check each VMA.

    [ Upstream commit c3b82d26bc85f5fc2fef5ec8cce17c89633a55a8 ]
    
    2 keymap fixes for the Acer Aspire One AOD270 and the same hardware
    rebranded as Packard Bell Dot SC:
    
    1. The F2 key is marked with a big '?' symbol on the Packard Bell Dot SC,
    this sends WMID_HOTKEY_EVENTs with a scancode of 0x27 add a mapping
    for this.
    
    2. Scancode 0x61 is KEY_SWITCHVIDEOMODE. Usually this is a duplicate
    input event with the "Video Bus" input device events. But on these devices
    the "Video Bus" does not send events for this key. Map 0x61 to KEY_UNKNOWN
    instead of using KE_IGNORE so that udev/hwdb can override it on these devs.

    The MSI is probably raised by incoming packets, so power down the device

    In addition to that, be extra safe and cancel reset task if it's running.

    hid: intel-ish-hid: ishtp: Fix ishtp client sending disordered message
    
    [ Upstream commit e1fa076706209cc447d7a2abd0843a18277e5ef7 ]
    
    There is a timing issue captured during ishtp client sending stress tests.
    It was observed during stress tests that ISH firmware is getting out of
    ordered messages. This is a rare scenario as the current set of ISH client
    drivers don't send much data to firmware. But this may not be the case
    going forward.
    
    When message size is bigger than IPC MTU, ishtp splits the message into
    fragments and uses serialized async method to send message fragments.
    The call stack:
    ishtp_cl_send_msg_ipc->ipc_tx_callback(first fregment)->
    ishtp_send_msg(with callback)->write_ipc_to_queue->
    write_ipc_from_queue->callback->ipc_tx_callback(next fregment)......
    
    When an ipc write complete interrupt is received, driver also calls
    write_ipc_from_queue->ipc_tx_callback in ISR to start sending of next fragment.
    
    Through ipc_tx_callback uses spin_lock to protect message splitting, as the
    serialized sending method will call back to ipc_tx_callback again, so it doesn't
    put sending under spin_lock, it causes driver cannot guarantee all fragments
    be sent in order.
    
    Considering this scenario:
    ipc_tx_callback just finished a fragment splitting, and not call ishtp_send_msg
    yet, there is a write complete interrupt happens, then ISR->write_ipc_from_queue
    ->ipc_tx_callback->ishtp_send_msg->write_ipc_to_queue......
    
    Because ISR has higher exec priority than normal thread, this causes the new
    fragment be sent out before previous fragment. This disordered message causes
    invalid message to firmware.
    
    The solution is, to send fragments synchronously:
    Use ishtp_write_message writing fragments into tx queue directly one by one,
    instead of ishtp_send_msg only writing one fragment with completion callback.
    As no completion callback be used, so change ipc_tx_callback to ipc_tx_send.

    drm/msm/rd: Fix FIFO-full deadlock
    
    [ Upstream commit 174974d8463b77c2b4065e98513adb204e64de7d ]
    
    If the previous thing cat'ing $debugfs/rd left the FIFO full, then
    subsequent open could deadlock in rd_write() (because open is blocked,
    not giving a chance for read() to consume any data in the FIFO).  Also
    it is generally a good idea to clear out old data from the FIFO.

    tracefs: Only clobber mode/uid/gid on remount if asked
    
    [ Upstream commit 47311db8e8f33011d90dee76b39c8886120cdda4 ]
    
    Users may have explicitly configured their tracefs permissions; we
    shouldn't overwrite those just because a second mount appeared.
    
    Only clobber if the options were provided at mount time.
    
    Note: the previous behavior was especially surprising in the presence of
    automounted /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/.
    
    Existing behavior:
    
      ## Pre-existing status: tracefs is 0755.
      # stat -c '%A' /sys/kernel/tracing/
      drwxr-xr-x
    
      ## (Re)trigger the automount.
      # umount /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
      # stat -c '%A' /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/.
      drwx------
    
      ## Unexpected: the automount changed mode for other mount instances.
      # stat -c '%A' /sys/kernel/tracing/
      drwx------
    
    New behavior (after this change):
    
      ## Pre-existing status: tracefs is 0755.
      # stat -c '%A' /sys/kernel/tracing/
      drwxr-xr-x
    
      ## (Re)trigger the automount.
      # umount /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
      # stat -c '%A' /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/.
      drwxr-xr-x
    
      ## Expected: the automount does not change other mount instances.
      # stat -c '%A' /sys/kernel/tracing/
      drwxr-xr-x

    iommu/vt-d: Correctly calculate sagaw value of IOMMU
    
    [ Upstream commit 53fc7ad6edf210b497230ce74b61b322a202470c ]
    
    The Intel IOMMU driver possibly selects between the first-level and the
    second-level translation tables for DMA address translation. However,
    the levels of page-table walks for the 4KB base page size are calculated
    from the SAGAW field of the capability register, which is only valid for
    the second-level page table. This causes the IOMMU driver to stop working
    if the hardware (or the emulated IOMMU) advertises only first-level
    translation capability and reports the SAGAW field as 0.
    
    This solves the above problem by considering both the first level and the
    second level when calculating the supported page table levels.
