    KVM: x86/speculation: Disable Fill buffer clear within guests
    
    commit 027bbb884be006b05d9c577d6401686053aa789e upstream
    
    The enumeration of MD_CLEAR in CPUID(EAX=7,ECX=0).EDX{bit 10} is not an
    accurate indicator on all CPUs of whether the VERW instruction will
    overwrite fill buffers. FB_CLEAR enumeration in
    IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES{bit 17} covers the case of CPUs that are not
    vulnerable to MDS/TAA, indicating that microcode does overwrite fill
    buffers.
    
    Guests running in VMM environments may not be aware of all the
    capabilities/vulnerabilities of the host CPU. Specifically, a guest may
    apply MDS/TAA mitigations when a virtual CPU is enumerated as vulnerable
    to MDS/TAA even when the physical CPU is not. On CPUs that enumerate
    FB_CLEAR_CTRL the VMM may set FB_CLEAR_DIS to skip overwriting of fill
    buffers by the VERW instruction. This is done by setting FB_CLEAR_DIS
    during VMENTER and resetting on VMEXIT. For guests that enumerate
    FB_CLEAR (explicitly asking for fill buffer clear capability) the VMM
    will not use FB_CLEAR_DIS.
    
    Irrespective of guest state, host overwrites CPU buffers before VMENTER
    to protect itself from an MMIO capable guest, as part of mitigation for
    MMIO Stale Data vulnerabilities.

    x86/speculation/mmio: Reuse SRBDS mitigation for SBDS
    
    commit a992b8a4682f119ae035a01b40d4d0665c4a2875 upstream
    
    The Shared Buffers Data Sampling (SBDS) variant of Processor MMIO Stale
    Data vulnerabilities may expose RDRAND, RDSEED and SGX EGETKEY data.
    Mitigation for this is added by a microcode update.
    
    As some of the implications of SBDS are similar to SRBDS, SRBDS mitigation
    infrastructure can be leveraged by SBDS. Set X86_BUG_SRBDS and use SRBDS
    mitigation.
    
    Mitigation is enabled by default; use srbds=off to opt-out. Mitigation
    status can be checked from below file:

    x86/speculation/srbds: Update SRBDS mitigation selection
    
    commit 22cac9c677c95f3ac5c9244f8ca0afdc7c8afb19 upstream
    
    Currently, Linux disables SRBDS mitigation on CPUs not affected by
    MDS and have the TSX feature disabled. On such CPUs, secrets cannot
    be extracted from CPU fill buffers using MDS or TAA. Without SRBDS
    mitigation, Processor MMIO Stale Data vulnerabilities can be used to
    extract RDRAND, RDSEED, and EGETKEY data.
    
    Do not disable SRBDS mitigation by default when CPU is also affected by
    Processor MMIO Stale Data vulnerabilities.

    x86/speculation/mmio: Enable CPU Fill buffer clearing on idle
    
    commit 99a83db5a605137424e1efe29dc0573d6a5b6316 upstream
    
    When the CPU is affected by Processor MMIO Stale Data vulnerabilities,
    Fill Buffer Stale Data Propagator (FBSDP) can propagate stale data out
    of Fill buffer to uncore buffer when CPU goes idle. Stale data can then
    be exploited with other variants using MMIO operations.
    
    Mitigate it by clearing the Fill buffer before entering idle state.

    x86/bugs: Group MDS, TAA & Processor MMIO Stale Data mitigations
    
    commit e5925fb867290ee924fcf2fe3ca887b792714366 upstream
    
    MDS, TAA and Processor MMIO Stale Data mitigations rely on clearing CPU
    buffers. Moreover, status of these mitigations affects each other.
    During boot, it is important to maintain the order in which these
    mitigations are selected. This is especially true for
    md_clear_update_mitigation() that needs to be called after MDS, TAA and
    Processor MMIO Stale Data mitigation selection is done.
    
    Introduce md_clear_select_mitigation(), and select all these mitigations
    from there. This reflects relationships between these mitigations and
    ensures proper ordering.

    x86/speculation/mmio: Add mitigation for Processor MMIO Stale Data
    
    commit 8cb861e9e3c9a55099ad3d08e1a3b653d29c33ca upstream
    
    Processor MMIO Stale Data is a class of vulnerabilities that may
    expose data after an MMIO operation. For details please refer to
    Documentation/admin-guide/hw-vuln/processor_mmio_stale_data.rst.
    
    These vulnerabilities are broadly categorized as:
    
    Device Register Partial Write (DRPW):
      Some endpoint MMIO registers incorrectly handle writes that are
      smaller than the register size. Instead of aborting the write or only
      copying the correct subset of bytes (for example, 2 bytes for a 2-byte
      write), more bytes than specified by the write transaction may be
      written to the register. On some processors, this may expose stale
      data from the fill buffers of the core that created the write
      transaction.
    
    Shared Buffers Data Sampling (SBDS):
      After propagators may have moved data around the uncore and copied
      stale data into client core fill buffers, processors affected by MFBDS
      can leak data from the fill buffer.
    
    Shared Buffers Data Read (SBDR):
      It is similar to Shared Buffer Data Sampling (SBDS) except that the
      data is directly read into the architectural software-visible state.
    
    An attacker can use these vulnerabilities to extract data from CPU fill
    buffers using MDS and TAA methods. Mitigate it by clearing the CPU fill
    buffers using the VERW instruction before returning to a user or a
    guest.
    
    On CPUs not affected by MDS and TAA, user application cannot sample data
    from CPU fill buffers using MDS or TAA. A guest with MMIO access can
    still use DRPW or SBDR to extract data architecturally. Mitigate it with
    VERW instruction to clear fill buffers before VMENTER for MMIO capable
    guests.
    
    Add a kernel parameter mmio_stale_data={off|full|full,nosmt} to control
    the mitigation.
