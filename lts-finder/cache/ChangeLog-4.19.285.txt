    wifi: rtlwifi: 8192de: correct checking of IQK reload
    
    commit 93fbc1ebd978cf408ef5765e9c1630fce9a8621b upstream.
    
    Since IQK could spend time, we make a cache of IQK result matrix that looks
    like iqk_matrix[channel_idx].val[x][y], and we can reload the matrix if we
    have made a cache. To determine a cache is made, we check
    iqk_matrix[channel_idx].val[0][0].
    
    The initial commit 7274a8c22980 ("rtlwifi: rtl8192de: Merge phy routines")
    make a mistake that checks incorrect iqk_matrix[channel_idx].val[0] that
    is always true, and this mistake is found by commit ee3db469dd31
    ("wifi: rtlwifi: remove always-true condition pointed out by GCC 12"), so
    I recall the vendor driver to find fix and apply the correctness.

    scsi: dpt_i2o: Do not process completions with invalid addresses
    
    adpt_isr() reads reply addresses from a hardware register, which
    should always be within the DMA address range of the device's pool of
    reply address buffers.  In case the address is out of range, it tries
    to muddle on, converting to a virtual address using bus_to_virt().
    
    bus_to_virt() does not take DMA addresses, and it doesn't make sense
    to try to handle the completion in this case.  Ignore it and continue
    looping to service the interrupt.  If a completion has been lost then
    the SCSI core should eventually time-out and trigger a reset.
    
    There is no corresponding upstream commit, because this driver was
    removed upstream.

    scsi: dpt_i2o: Remove broken pass-through ioctl (I2OUSERCMD)
    
    adpt_i2o_passthru() takes a user-provided message and passes it
    through to the hardware with appropriate translation of addresses
    and message IDs.  It has a number of bugs:
    
    - When a message requires scatter/gather, it doesn't verify that the
      offset to the scatter/gather list is less than the message size.
    - When a message requires scatter/gather, it overwrites the DMA
      addresses with the user-space virtual addresses before unmapping the
      DMA buffers.
    - It reads the message from user memory multiple times.  This allows
      user-space to change the message and bypass validation.
    - It assumes that the message is at least 4 words long, but doesn't
      check that.
    
    I tried fixing these, but even the maintainer of the corresponding
    user-space in Debian doesn't have the hardware any more.
    
    Instead, remove the pass-through ioctl (I2OUSRCMD) and supporting
    code.
    
    There is no corresponding upstream commit, because this driver was
    removed upstream.

    regmap: Account for register length when chunking
    
    commit 3981514180c987a79ea98f0ae06a7cbf58a9ac0f upstream.
    
    Currently, when regmap_raw_write() splits the data, it uses the
    max_raw_write value defined for the bus.  For any bus that includes
    the target register address in the max_raw_write value, the chunked
    transmission will always exceed the maximum transmission length.
    To avoid this problem, subtract the length of the register and the
    padding from the maximum transmission.

    ea_inodes in ext4_xattr_inode_write().  However, ea_inodes will be

    selinux: don't use make's grouped targets feature yet
    
    commit 42c4e97e06a839b07d834f640a10911ad84ec8b3 upstream.
    
    The Linux Kernel currently only requires make v3.82 while the grouped
    target functionality requires make v4.3.  Removed the grouped target
    introduced in 4ce1f694eb5d ("selinux: ensure av_permissions.h is
    built when needed") as well as the multiple header file targets in
    the make rule.  This effectively reverts the problem commit.
    
    We will revisit this change when make >= 4.3 is required by the rest
    of the kernel.

    tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: use UARTCTRL_TXINV to send break instead of UARTCTRL_SBK
    
    commit 2474e05467c00f7d51af3039b664de6886325257 upstream.
    
    LPUART IP now has two known bugs, one is that CTS has higher priority
    than the break signal, which causes the break signal sending through
    UARTCTRL_SBK may impacted by the CTS input if the HW flow control is
    enabled. It exists on all platforms we support in this driver.
    So we add a workaround patch for this issue: commit c4c81db5cf8b
    ("tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: disable the CTS when send break signal").
    
    Another IP bug is i.MX8QM LPUART may have an additional break character
    being sent after SBK was cleared. It may need to add some delay between
    clearing SBK and re-enabling CTS to ensure that the SBK latch are
    completely cleared.
    
    But we found that during the delay period before CTS is enabled, there
    is still a risk that Bluetooth data in TX FIFO may be sent out during
    this period because of break off and CTS disabled(even if BT sets CTS
    line deasserted, data is still sent to BT).
    
    Due to this risk, we have to drop the CTS-disabling workaround for SBK
    bugs, use TXINV seems to be a better way to replace SBK feature and
    avoid above risk. Also need to disable the transmitter to prevent any
    data from being sent out during break, then invert the TX line to send
    break. Then disable the TXINV when turn off break and re-enable
    transmitter.

    gcc-12: disable '-Wdangling-pointer' warning for now
    
    commit f7d63b50898172b9eb061b9e2daad61b428792d0 upstream.
    
    [ Upstream commit 49beadbd47c270a00754c107a837b4f29df4c822 ]
    
    While the concept of checking for dangling pointers to local variables
    at function exit is really interesting, the gcc-12 implementation is not
    compatible with reality, and results in false positives.
    
    For example, gcc sees us putting things on a local list head allocated
    on the stack, which involves exactly those kinds of pointers to the
    local stack entry:
    
      In function ‘__list_add’,
          inlined from ‘list_add_tail’ at include/linux/list.h:102:2,
          inlined from ‘rebuild_snap_realms’ at fs/ceph/snap.c:434:2:
      include/linux/list.h:74:19: warning: storing the address of local variable ‘realm_queue’ in ‘*&realm_27(D)->rebuild_item.prev’ [-Wdangling-pointer=]
         74 |         new->prev = prev;
            |         ~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~
    
    But then gcc - understandably - doesn't really understand the big
    picture how the doubly linked list works, so doesn't see how we then end
    up emptying said list head in a loop and the pointer we added has been
    removed.
    
    Gcc also complains about us (intentionally) using this as a way to store
    a kind of fake stack trace, eg
    
      drivers/acpi/acpica/utdebug.c:40:38: warning: storing the address of local variable ‘current_sp’ in ‘acpi_gbl_entry_stack_pointer’ [-Wdangling-pointer=]
         40 |         acpi_gbl_entry_stack_pointer = &current_sp;
            |         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    which is entirely reasonable from a compiler standpoint, and we may want
    to change those kinds of patterns, but not not.
    
    So this is one of those "it would be lovely if the compiler were to
    complain about us leaving dangling pointers to the stack", but not this
    way.

    x86/boot: Wrap literal addresses in absolute_pointer()
    
    commit aeb84412037b89e06f45e382f044da6f200e12f8 upstream.
    
    GCC 11 (incorrectly[1]) assumes that literal values cast to (void *)
    should be treated like a NULL pointer with an offset, and raises
    diagnostics when doing bounds checking under -Warray-bounds. GCC 12
    got "smarter" about finding these:
    
      In function 'rdfs8',
          inlined from 'vga_recalc_vertical' at /srv/code/arch/x86/boot/video-mode.c:124:29,
          inlined from 'set_mode' at /srv/code/arch/x86/boot/video-mode.c:163:3:
      /srv/code/arch/x86/boot/boot.h:114:9: warning: array subscript 0 is outside array bounds of 'u8[0]' {aka 'unsigned char[]'} [-Warray-bounds]
        114 |         asm volatile("movb %%fs:%1,%0" : "=q" (v) : "m" (*(u8 *)addr));
            |         ^~~
    
    This has been solved in other places[2] already by using the recently
    added absolute_pointer() macro. Do the same here.

    ata: libata-scsi: Use correct device no in ata_find_dev()
    
    commit 7f875850f20a42f488840c9df7af91ef7db2d576 upstream.
    
    For devices not attached to a port multiplier and managed directly by
    libata, the device number passed to ata_find_dev() must always be lower
    than the maximum number of devices returned by ata_link_max_devices().
    That is 1 for SATA devices or 2 for an IDE link with master+slave
    devices. This device number is the SCSI device ID which matches these
    constraints as the IDs are generated per port and so never exceed the
    maximum number of devices for the link being used.
    
    However, for libsas managed devices, SCSI device IDs are assigned per
    struct scsi_host, leading to device IDs for SATA devices that can be
    well in excess of libata per-link maximum number of devices. This
    results in ata_find_dev() to always return NULL for libsas managed
    devices except for the first device of the target scsi_host with ID
    (device number) equal to 0. This issue is visible by executing the
    hdparm utility, which fails. E.g.:
    
    hdparm -i /dev/sdX
    /dev/sdX:
      HDIO_GET_IDENTITY failed: No message of desired type
    
    Fix this by rewriting ata_find_dev() to ignore the device number for
    non-PMP attached devices with a link with at most 1 device, that is SATA
    devices. For these, the device number 0 is always used to
    return the correct pointer to the struct ata_device of the port link.
    This change excludes IDE master/slave setups (maximum number of devices
    per link is 2) and port-multiplier attached devices. Also, to be
    consistant with the fact that SCSI device IDs and channel numbers used
    as device numbers are both unsigned int, change the devno argument of
    ata_find_dev() to unsigned int.

    usb: gadget: f_fs: Add unbind event before functionfs_unbind
    
    commit efb6b535207395a5c7317993602e2503ca8cb4b3 upstream.
    
    While exercising the unbind path, with the current implementation
    the functionfs_unbind would be calling which waits for the ffs->mutex
    to be available, however within the same time ffs_ep0_read is invoked
    & if no setup packets are pending, it will invoke function
    wait_event_interruptible_exclusive_locked_irq which by definition waits
    for the ev.count to be increased inside the same mutex for which
    functionfs_unbind is waiting.
    This creates deadlock situation because the functionfs_unbind won't
    get the lock until ev.count is increased which can only happen if
    the caller ffs_func_unbind can proceed further.
    
    Following is the illustration:
    
            CPU1                            CPU2
    
    ffs_func_unbind()               ffs_ep0_read()
                                    mutex_lock(ffs->mutex)
                                    wait_event(ffs->ev.count)
    functionfs_unbind()
      mutex_lock(ffs->mutex)
      mutex_unlock(ffs->mutex)
    
    ffs_event_add()
    
    <deadlock>
    
    Fix this by moving the event unbind before functionfs_unbind
    to ensure the ev.count is incrased properly.

    Commit 28d1a7ac2a0d ("iio: dac: Add AD5758 support") adds the config AD5758

    is however included when AD5755 is selected, not when AD5758 is selected.
    
    Probably, this was simply a mistake that happened by copy-and-paste and
    forgetting to adjust the actual line. Surprisingly, no one has ever noticed
    that this driver is actually only included when AD5755 is selected and that
    the config AD5758 has actually no effect on the build.

    iio: adc: mxs-lradc: fix the order of two cleanup operations
    
    commit 27b2ed5b6d53cd62fc61c3f259ae52f5cac23b66 upstream.
    
    Smatch reports:
    drivers/iio/adc/mxs-lradc-adc.c:766 mxs_lradc_adc_probe() warn:
    missing unwind goto?
    
    the order of three init operation:
    1.mxs_lradc_adc_trigger_init
    2.iio_triggered_buffer_setup
    3.mxs_lradc_adc_hw_init
    
    thus, the order of three cleanup operation should be:
    1.mxs_lradc_adc_hw_stop
    2.iio_triggered_buffer_cleanup
    3.mxs_lradc_adc_trigger_remove
    
    we exchange the order of two cleanup operations,
    introducing the following differences:
    1.if mxs_lradc_adc_trigger_init fails, returns directly;
    2.if trigger_init succeeds but iio_triggered_buffer_setup fails,
    goto err_trig and remove the trigger.
    
    In addition, we also reorder the unwind that goes on in the
    remove() callback to match the new ordering.

    [ Upstream commit 040b5a046a9e18098580d3ccd029e2318fca7859 ]
    
    Two functions are defined and used in pcm_oss.c but also optionally
    used from io.c, with an optional prototype. If CONFIG_SND_PCM_OSS_PLUGINS
    is disabled, this causes a warning as the functions are not static

    wifi: b43: fix incorrect __packed annotation
    
    [ Upstream commit 212457ccbd60dba34f965e4ffbe62f0e4f970538 ]
    
    clang warns about an unpacked structure inside of a packed one:
    
    drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/b43/b43.h:654:4: error: field data within 'struct b43_iv' is less aligned than 'union (unnamed union at /home/arnd/arm-soc/drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/b43/b43.h:651:2)' and is usually due to 'struct b43_iv' being packed, which can lead to unaligned accesses [-Werror,-Wunaligned-access]
    
    The problem here is that the anonymous union has the default alignment
    from its members, apparently because the original author mixed up the
    placement of the __packed attribute by placing it next to the struct
    member rather than the union definition. As the struct itself is
    also marked as __packed, there is no need to mark its members, so just
    move the annotation to the inner type instead.
    
    As Michael noted, the same problem is present in b43legacy, so
    change both at the same time.

    scsi: core: Decrease scsi_device's iorequest_cnt if dispatch failed
    
    [ Upstream commit 09e797c8641f6ad435c33ae24c223351197ea29a ]
    
    If scsi_dispatch_cmd() failed, the SCSI command was not sent to the target,
    scsi_queue_rq() would return BLK_STS_RESOURCE and the related request would
    be requeued. The timeout of this request would not fire, no one would
    increase iodone_cnt.
    
    The above flow would result the iodone_cnt smaller than iorequest_cnt.  So
    decrease the iorequest_cnt if dispatch failed to workaround the issue.

    wifi: rtl8xxxu: fix authentication timeout due to incorrect RCR value
    
    [ Upstream commit 20429444e653ee8242dfbf815c0c37866beb371b ]
    
    When using rtl8192cu with rtl8xxxu driver to connect wifi, there is a
    probability of failure, which shows "authentication with ... timed out".
    Through debugging, it was found that the RCR register has been inexplicably
    modified to an incorrect value, resulting in the nic not being able to
    receive authenticated frames.
    
    To fix this problem, add regrcr in rtl8xxxu_priv struct, and store
    the RCR value every time the register is written, and use it the next
    time the register need to be modified.

    If the device node of dvb_ca_en50221 is open() and the
    device is disconnected, a UAF may occur when calling

    The root cause is that wake_up() and wait_event() for
    dvbdev->wait_queue are not implemented.
    
    So implement wait_event() function in dvb_ca_en50221_release()
    and add 'remove_mutex' which prevents race condition
    for 'ca->exit'.

    Using a semaphore in the wait_event*() condition is no good idea.
    It hits a kernel WARN_ON() at prepare_to_wait_event() like:
      do not call blocking ops when !TASK_RUNNING; state=1 set at
      prepare_to_wait_event+0x6d/0x690
    
    For avoiding the potential deadlock, rewrite to an open-coded loop
    instead.  Unlike the loop in wait_event*(), this uses wait_woken()
    after the condition check, hence the task state stays consistent.

    [ Upstream commit 4172385b0c9ac366dcab78eda48c26814b87ed1a ]
    
    A race condition may occur between the .disconnect function, which
    is called when the device is disconnected, and the dvb_device_open()
    function, which is called when the device node is open()ed.
    This results in several types of UAFs.
    
    The root cause of this is that you use the dvb_device_open() function,
    which does not implement a conditional statement
    that checks 'dvbnet->exit'.
    
    So, add 'remove_mutex` to protect 'dvbnet->exit' and use
    locked_dvb_net_open() function to check 'dvbnet->exit'.

    media: dvb_ca_en50221: fix a size write bug
    
    [ Upstream commit a4315e5be7020aac9b24a8151caf4bb85224cd0e ]
    
    The function of "dvb_ca_en50221_write_data" at source/drivers/media
    /dvb-core/dvb_ca_en50221.c is used for two cases.
    The first case is for writing APDU data in the function of
    "dvb_ca_en50221_io_write" at source/drivers/media/dvb-core/
    dvb_ca_en50221.c.
    The second case is for writing the host link buf size on the
    Command Register in the function of "dvb_ca_en50221_link_init"
    at source/drivers/media/dvb-core/dvb_ca_en50221.c.
    In the second case, there exists a bug like following.
    In the function of the "dvb_ca_en50221_link_init",
    after a TV host calculates the host link buf_size,
    the TV host writes the calculated host link buf_size on the
    Size Register.
    Accroding to the en50221 Spec (the page 60 of
    https://dvb.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/En50221.V1.pdf),
    before this writing operation, the "SW(CMDREG_SW)" flag in the
    Command Register should be set. We can see this setting operation
    in the function of the "dvb_ca_en50221_link_init" like below.
    ...
            if ((ret = ca->pub->write_cam_control(ca->pub, slot,
    CTRLIF_COMMAND, IRQEN | CMDREG_SW)) != 0)
                    return ret;
    ...
    But, after that, the real writing operation is implemented using
    the function of the "dvb_ca_en50221_write_data" in the function of
    "dvb_ca_en50221_link_init", and the "dvb_ca_en50221_write_data"
    includes the function of "ca->pub->write_cam_control",
    and the function of the "ca->pub->write_cam_control" in the
    function of the "dvb_ca_en50221_wrte_data" does not include
    "CMDREG_SW" flag like below.
    ...
            if ((status = ca->pub->write_cam_control(ca->pub, slot,
    CTRLIF_COMMAND, IRQEN | CMDREG_HC)) != 0)
    ...
    In the above source code, we can see only the "IRQEN | CMDREG_HC",
    but we cannot see the "CMDREG_SW".
    The "CMDREG_SW" flag which was set in the function of the
    "dvb_ca_en50221_link_init" was rollbacked by the follwoing function
    of the "dvb_ca_en50221_write_data".
    This is a bug. and this bug causes that the calculated host link buf_size
    is not properly written in the CI module.
    Through this patch, we fix this bug.

    media: netup_unidvb: fix irq init by register it at the end of probe
    
    [ Upstream commit e6ad6233592593079db5c8fa592c298e51bc1356 ]
    
    IRQ handler netup_spi_interrupt() takes spinlock spi->lock. The lock
    is initialized in netup_spi_init(). However, irq handler is registered
    before initializing the lock.
    
    Spinlock dma->lock and i2c->lock suffer from the same problem.
    
    Fix this by registering the irq at the end of probe.

    In su3000_read_mac_address, if i2c_transfer fails to execute two

    [ Upstream commit 7efb10d8dc70ea3000cc70dca53407c52488acd1 ]
    
    In dvb_demux.c, some logics exist which compare the expected
    continuity counter and the real continuity counter. If they
    are not matched each other, both of the expected continuity
    counter and the real continuity counter should be printed.
    But there exists a bug that the expected continuity counter
    is not correctly printed. The expected continuity counter is
    replaced with the real countinuity counter + 1 so that
    the epected continuity counter is not correclty printed.
    This is wrong. This bug is fixed.

    ASoC: ssm2602: Add workaround for playback distortions
    
    [ Upstream commit f63550e2b165208a2f382afcaf5551df9569e1d4 ]
    
    Apply a workaround for what appears to be a hardware quirk.
    
    The problem seems to happen when enabling "whole chip power" (bit D7
    register R6) for the very first time after the chip receives power. If
    either "output" (D4) or "DAC" (D3) aren't powered on at that time,
    playback becomes very distorted later on.
    
    This happens on the Google Chameleon v3, as well as on a ZYBO Z7-10:
    https://ez.analog.com/audio/f/q-a/543726/solved-ssm2603-right-output-offset-issue/480229
    I suspect this happens only when using an external MCLK signal (which
    is the case for both of these boards).
    
    Here are some experiments run on a Google Chameleon v3. These were run
    in userspace using a wrapper around the i2cset utility:
    ssmset() {
            i2cset -y 0 0x1a $(($1*2)) $2
    }
    
    For each of the following sequences, we apply power to the ssm2603
    chip, set the configuration registers R0-R5 and R7-R8, run the selected
    sequence, and check for distortions on playback.
    
      ssmset 0x09 0x01 # core
      ssmset 0x06 0x07 # chip, out, dac
      OK
    
      ssmset 0x09 0x01 # core
      ssmset 0x06 0x87 # out, dac
      ssmset 0x06 0x07 # chip

      (disable MCLK)
      ssmset 0x09 0x01 # core
      ssmset 0x06 0x1f # chip
      ssmset 0x06 0x07 # out, dac
      (enable MCLK)
      OK
    
      ssmset 0x09 0x01 # core
      ssmset 0x06 0x1f # chip
      ssmset 0x06 0x07 # out, dac
      NOT OK
    
      ssmset 0x06 0x1f # chip
      ssmset 0x09 0x01 # core
      ssmset 0x06 0x07 # out, dac
      NOT OK
    
      ssmset 0x09 0x01 # core
      ssmset 0x06 0x0f # chip, out
      ssmset 0x06 0x07 # dac
      NOT OK
    
      ssmset 0x09 0x01 # core
      ssmset 0x06 0x17 # chip, dac
      ssmset 0x06 0x07 # out
      NOT OK
    
    For each of the following sequences, we apply power to the ssm2603
    chip, run the selected sequence, issue a reset with R15, configure
    R0-R5 and R7-R8, run one of the NOT OK sequences from above, and check
    for distortions.
    
      ssmset 0x09 0x01 # core
      ssmset 0x06 0x07 # chip, out, dac
      OK
    
      (disable MCLK)
      ssmset 0x09 0x01 # core
      ssmset 0x06 0x07 # chip, out, dac
      (enable MCLK after reset)
      NOT OK

    xfrm: Check if_id in inbound policy/secpath match
    
    [ Upstream commit 8680407b6f8f5fba59e8f1d63c869abc280f04df ]
    
    This change ensures that if configured in the policy, the if_id set in
    the policy and secpath states match during the inbound policy check.
    Without this, there is potential for ambiguity where entries in the
    secpath differing by only the if_id could be mismatched.
    
    Notably, this is checked in the outbound direction when resolving
    templates to SAs, but not on the inbound path when matching SAs and
    policies.

    media: rcar-vin: Select correct interrupt mode for V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE
    
    [ Upstream commit e10707d5865c90d3dfe4ef589ce02ff4287fef85 ]
    
    When adding proper support for V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE it was missed that
    this field format should trigger an interrupt for each field, not just
    for the whole frame. Fix this by marking it as progressive in the
    capture setup, which will then select the correct interrupt mode.
    
    Tested on both Gen2 and Gen3 with the result of a doubling of the frame
    rate for V4L2_FIELD_ALTERNATE. From a PAL video source the frame rate is
    now 50, which is expected for alternate field capture.

    ARM: 9295/1: unwind:fix unwind abort for uleb128 case
    
    [ Upstream commit fa3eeb638de0c1a9d2d860e5b48259facdd65176 ]
    
    When unwind instruction is 0xb2,the subsequent instructions
    are uleb128 bytes.
    For now,it uses only the first uleb128 byte in code.
    
    For vsp increments of 0x204~0x400,use one uleb128 byte like below:
    0xc06a00e4 <unwind_test_work>: 0x80b27fac
      Compact model index: 0
      0xb2 0x7f vsp = vsp + 1024
      0xac      pop {r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r14}
    
    For vsp increments larger than 0x400,use two uleb128 bytes like below:
    0xc06a00e4 <unwind_test_work>: @0xc0cc9e0c
      Compact model index: 1
      0xb2 0x81 0x01 vsp = vsp + 1032
      0xac      pop {r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r14}
    The unwind works well since the decoded uleb128 byte is also 0x81.
    
    For vsp increments larger than 0x600,use two uleb128 bytes like below:
    0xc06a00e4 <unwind_test_work>: @0xc0cc9e0c
      Compact model index: 1
      0xb2 0x81 0x02 vsp = vsp + 1544
      0xac      pop {r4, r5, r6, r7, r8, r14}
    In this case,the decoded uleb128 result is 0x101(vsp=0x204+(0x101<<2)).
    While the uleb128 used in code is 0x81(vsp=0x204+(0x81<<2)).
    The unwind aborts at this frame since it gets incorrect vsp.
    
    To fix this,add uleb128 decode to cover all the above case.

    mailbox: mailbox-test: Fix potential double-free in mbox_test_message_write()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d1e952a2b8e5e92d8d55ac88a7cf7ca5ea591ad ]
    
    If a user can make copy_from_user() fail, there is a potential for
    UAF/DF due to a lack of locking around the allocation, use and freeing
    of the data buffers.

    watchdog: menz069_wdt: fix watchdog initialisation
    
    [ Upstream commit 87b22656ca6a896d0378e9e60ffccb0c82f48b08 ]
    
    Doing a 'cat /dev/watchdog0' with menz069_wdt as watchdog0 will result in
    a NULL pointer dereference.
    
    This happens because we're passing the wrong pointer to
    watchdog_register_device(). Fix this by getting rid of the static
    watchdog_device structure and use the one embedded into the driver's
    per-instance private data.

    net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Increase wait after reset deactivation
    
    [ Upstream commit 3c27f3d53d588618d81d30d6712459a3cc9489b8 ]
    
    A switch held in reset by default needs to wait longer until we can
    reliably detect it.
    
    An issue was observed when testing on the Marvell 88E6393X (Link Street).
    The driver failed to detect the switch on some upstarts. Increasing the
    wait time after reset deactivation solves this issue.
    
    The updated wait time is now also the same as the wait time in the
    mv88e6xxx_hardware_reset function.

    ocfs2/dlm: move BITS_TO_BYTES() to bitops.h for wider use
    
    [ Upstream commit dd3e7cba16274831f5a69f071ed3cf13ffb352ea ]
    
    There are users already and will be more of BITS_TO_BYTES() macro.  Move
    it to bitops.h for wider use.
    
    In the case of ocfs2 the replacement is identical.
    
    As for bnx2x, there are two places where floor version is used.  In the
    first case to calculate the amount of structures that can fit one memory
    page.  In this case obviously the ceiling variant is correct and
    original code might have a potential bug, if amount of bits % 8 is not
    0.  In the second case the macro is used to calculate bytes transmitted
    in one microsecond.  This will work for all speeds which is multiply of
    1Gbps without any change, for the rest new code will give ceiling value,
    for instance 100Mbps will give 13 bytes, while old code gives 12 bytes
    and the arithmetically correct one is 12.5 bytes.  Further the value is
    used to setup timer threshold which in any case has its own margins due
    to certain resolution.  I don't see here an issue with slightly shifting
    thresholds for low speed connections, the card is supposed to utilize
    highest available rate, which is usually 10Gbps.

    This is because when mq is added for the first time, qdiscs in mq is set
    to NULL in mq_attach(). Therefore, when replacing mq after adding mq, we
    need to initialize qdiscs in the mq before continuing to graft. Otherwise,
    it will couse NULL pointer dereference issue in mq_attach(). And the same
    issue will occur in the attach functions of mqprio, taprio and htb.
    ffff:fff1 means that the repalce qdisc is ingress. Ingress does not allow
    any qdisc to be attached. Therefore, ffff:fff1 is incorrectly used, and
    the command should be dropped.

    net/sched: Prohibit regrafting ingress or clsact Qdiscs
    
    [ Upstream commit 9de95df5d15baa956c2b70b9e794842e790a8a13 ]
    
    Currently, after creating an ingress (or clsact) Qdisc and grafting it
    under TC_H_INGRESS (TC_H_CLSACT), it is possible to graft it again under
    e.g. a TBF Qdisc:
    
      $ ip link add ifb0 type ifb
      $ tc qdisc add dev ifb0 handle 1: root tbf rate 20kbit buffer 1600 limit 3000
      $ tc qdisc add dev ifb0 clsact
      $ tc qdisc link dev ifb0 handle ffff: parent 1:1
      $ tc qdisc show dev ifb0
      qdisc tbf 1: root refcnt 2 rate 20Kbit burst 1600b lat 560.0ms
      qdisc clsact ffff: parent ffff:fff1 refcnt 2
                                          ^^^^^^^^
    
    clsact's refcount has increased: it is now grafted under both
    TC_H_CLSACT and 1:1.
    
    ingress and clsact Qdiscs should only be used under TC_H_INGRESS
    (TC_H_CLSACT).  Prohibit regrafting them.

    [ Upstream commit f85fa45d4a9408d98c46c8fa45ba2e3b2f4bf219 ]
    
    Currently it is possible to add e.g. an HTB Qdisc under ffff:fff1
    (TC_H_INGRESS, TC_H_CLSACT):
    
      $ ip link add name ifb0 type ifb
      $ tc qdisc add dev ifb0 parent ffff:fff1 htb
      $ tc qdisc add dev ifb0 clsact
      Error: Exclusivity flag on, cannot modify.
      $ drgn
      ...
      >>> ifb0 = netdev_get_by_name(prog, "ifb0")
      >>> qdisc = ifb0.ingress_queue.qdisc_sleeping
      >>> print(qdisc.ops.id.string_().decode())
      htb
      >>> qdisc.flags.value_() # TCQ_F_INGRESS
      2
    
    Only allow ingress and clsact Qdiscs under ffff:fff1.  Return -EINVAL
    for everything else.  Make TCQ_F_INGRESS a static flag of ingress and
    clsact Qdiscs.

    tcp: Return user_mss for TCP_MAXSEG in CLOSE/LISTEN state if user_mss set
    
    [ Upstream commit 34dfde4ad87b84d21278a7e19d92b5b2c68e6c4d ]
    
    This patch replaces the tp->mss_cache check in getting TCP_MAXSEG
    with tp->rx_opt.user_mss check for CLOSE/LISTEN sock. Since
    tp->mss_cache is initialized with TCP_MSS_DEFAULT, checking if
    it's zero is probably a bug.
    
    With this change, getting TCP_MAXSEG before connecting will return
    default MSS normally, and return user_mss if user_mss is set.

    tcp: deny tcp_disconnect() when threads are waiting
    
    [ Upstream commit 4faeee0cf8a5d88d63cdbc3bab124fb0e6aed08c ]
    
    Historically connect(AF_UNSPEC) has been abused by syzkaller
    and other fuzzers to trigger various bugs.
    
    A recent one triggers a divide-by-zero [1], and Paolo Abeni
    was able to diagnose the issue.
    
    tcp_recvmsg_locked() has tests about sk_state being not TCP_LISTEN
    and TCP REPAIR mode being not used.
    
    Then later if socket lock is released in sk_wait_data(),
    another thread can call connect(AF_UNSPEC), then make this
    socket a TCP listener.
    
    When recvmsg() is resumed, it can eventually call tcp_cleanup_rbuf()
    and attempt a divide by 0 in tcp_rcv_space_adjust() [1]
    
    This patch adds a new socket field, counting number of threads
    blocked in sk_wait_event() and inet_wait_for_connect().
    
    If this counter is not zero, tcp_disconnect() returns an error.
    
    This patch adds code in blocking socket system calls, thus should
    not hurt performance of non blocking ones.
    
    Note that we probably could revert commit 499350a5a6e7 ("tcp:
    initialize rcv_mss to TCP_MIN_MSS instead of 0") to restore
    original tcpi_rcv_mss meaning (was 0 if no payload was ever
    received on a socket)

    In the event of a change in XGBE mode, the current auto-negotiation
    needs to be reset and the AN cycle needs to be re-triggerred. However,
    the current code ignores the return value of xgbe_set_mode(), leading to
    false information as the link is declared without checking the status

    Fix this by propagating the mode switch status information to

    netrom: fix info-leak in nr_write_internal()

    <quote>
    
    The Online Amateur Radio Community (OARC) has recently been experimenting
    with building a nationwide packet network in the UK.
    As part of our experimentation, we have been testing out packet on 300bps HF,
    and playing with net/rom.  For HF packet at this baud rate you really need
    to make sure that your MTU is relatively low; AX.25 suggests a PACLEN of 60,
    and a net/rom PACLEN of 40 to go with that.
    However the Linux net/rom support didn't work with a low PACLEN;
    the mkiss module would truncate packets if you set the PACLEN below about 200 or so, e.g.:
    
    Apr 19 14:00:51 radio kernel: [12985.747310] mkiss: ax1: truncating oversized transmit packet!
    
    This didn't make any sense to me (if the packets are smaller why would they
    be truncated?) so I started investigating.
    I looked at the packets using ethereal, and found that many were just huge
    compared to what I would expect.
    A simple net/rom connection request packet had the request and then a bunch
    of what appeared to be random data following it:

    not want to count NR_NETWORK_LEN twice.

    [ Upstream commit a1a5f2c887252dec161c1e12e04303ca9ba56fa9 ]
    
    "_start" is used in several arches and proably should be reserved

    a build error when it conflicts with ARCH usage of the same symbol.

    is no conflict and no build error.

    commit 9b7c68b3911aef84afa4cbfc31bce20f10570d51 upstream.
    
    Currently, offloaded conntrack entries (flows) can only be deleted
    after they are removed from offload, which is either by timeout,
    tcp state change or tc ct rule deletion. This can cause issues for
    users wishing to manually delete or flush existing entries.
    
    Support deletion of offloaded conntrack entries.
    
    Example usage:
     # Delete all offloaded (and non offloaded) conntrack entries
     # whose source address is 1.2.3.4
     $ conntrack -D -s 1.2.3.4

    ipv{4,6}/raw: fix output xfrm lookup wrt protocol
    
    commit 3632679d9e4f879f49949bb5b050e0de553e4739 upstream.
    
    With a raw socket bound to IPPROTO_RAW (ie with hdrincl enabled), the
    protocol field of the flow structure, build by raw_sendmsg() /
    rawv6_sendmsg()),  is set to IPPROTO_RAW. This breaks the ipsec policy
    lookup when some policies are defined with a protocol in the selector.
    
    For ipv6, the sin6_port field from 'struct sockaddr_in6' could be used to
    specify the protocol. Just accept all values for IPPROTO_RAW socket.
    
    For ipv4, the sin_port field of 'struct sockaddr_in' could not be used
    without breaking backward compatibility (the value of this field was never
    checked). Let's add a new kind of control message, so that the userland
    could specify which protocol is used.

    bluetooth: Add cmd validity checks at the start of hci_sock_ioctl()
    
    commit 000c2fa2c144c499c881a101819cf1936a1f7cf2 upstream.
    
    Previously, channel open messages were always sent to monitors on the first
    ioctl() call for unbound HCI sockets, even if the command and arguments
    were completely invalid. This can leave an exploitable hole with the abuse
    of invalid ioctl calls.
    
    This commit hardens the ioctl processing logic by first checking if the
    command is valid, and immediately returning with an ENOIOCTLCMD error code
    if it is not. This ensures that ioctl calls with invalid commands are free
    of side effects, and increases the difficulty of further exploitation by
    forcing exploitation to find a way to pass a valid command first.

    power: supply: bq24190: Call power_supply_changed() after updating input current
    
    [ Upstream commit 77c2a3097d7029441e8a91aa0de1b4e5464593da ]
    
    The bq24192 model relies on external charger-type detection and once
    that is done the bq24190_charger code will update the input current.
    
    In this case, when the initial power_supply_changed() call is made
    from the interrupt handler, the input settings are 5V/0.5A which
    on many devices is not enough power to charge (while the device is on).
    
    On many devices the fuel-gauge relies in its external_power_changed
    callback to timely signal userspace about charging <-> discharging
    status changes. Add a power_supply_changed() call after updating
    the input current. This allows the fuel-gauge driver to timely recheck
    if the battery is charging after the new input current has been applied
    and then it can immediately notify userspace about this.

    power: supply: core: Refactor power_supply_set_input_current_limit_from_supplier()
    
    [ Upstream commit 2220af8ca61ae67de4ec3deec1c6395a2f65b9fd ]
    
    Some (USB) charger ICs have variants with USB D+ and D- pins to do their
    own builtin charger-type detection, like e.g. the bq24190 and bq25890 and
    also variants which lack this functionality, e.g. the bq24192 and bq25892.
    
    In case the charger-type; and thus the input-current-limit detection is
    done outside the charger IC then we need some way to communicate this to
    the charger IC. In the past extcon was used for this, but if the external
    detection does e.g. full USB PD negotiation then the extcon cable-types do
    not convey enough information.
    
    For these setups it was decided to model the external charging "brick"
    and the parameters negotiated with it as a power_supply class-device
    itself; and power_supply_set_input_current_limit_from_supplier() was
    introduced to allow drivers to get the input-current-limit this way.
    
    But in some cases psy drivers may want to know other properties, e.g. the
    bq25892 can do "quick-charge" negotiation by pulsing its current draw,
    but this should only be done if the usb_type psy-property of its supplier
    is set to DCP (and device-properties indicate the board allows higher
    voltages).
    
    Instead of adding extra helper functions for each property which
    a psy-driver wants to query from its supplier, refactor
    power_supply_set_input_current_limit_from_supplier() into a
    more generic power_supply_get_property_from_supplier() function.

    net: cdc_ncm: Deal with too low values of dwNtbOutMaxSize
    
    [ Upstream commit 7e01c7f7046efc2c7c192c3619db43292b98e997 ]
    
    Currently in cdc_ncm_check_tx_max(), if dwNtbOutMaxSize is lower than
    the calculated "min" value, but greater than zero, the logic sets
    tx_max to dwNtbOutMaxSize. This is then used to allocate a new SKB in
    cdc_ncm_fill_tx_frame() where all the data is handled.
    
    For small values of dwNtbOutMaxSize the memory allocated during
    alloc_skb(dwNtbOutMaxSize, GFP_ATOMIC) will have the same size, due to
    how size is aligned at alloc time:
            size = SKB_DATA_ALIGN(size);
            size += SKB_DATA_ALIGN(sizeof(struct skb_shared_info));
    Thus we hit the same bug that we tried to squash with
    commit 2be6d4d16a084 ("net: cdc_ncm: Allow for dwNtbOutMaxSize to be unset or zero")
    
    Low values of dwNtbOutMaxSize do not cause an issue presently because at
    alloc_skb() time more memory (512b) is allocated than required for the
    SKB headers alone (320b), leaving some space (512b - 320b = 192b)
    for CDC data (172b).
    
    However, if more elements (for example 3 x u64 = [24b]) were added to
    one of the SKB header structs, say 'struct skb_shared_info',
    increasing its original size (320b [320b aligned]) to something larger
    (344b [384b aligned]), then suddenly the CDC data (172b) no longer
    fits in the spare SKB data area (512b - 384b = 128b).
    
    Consequently the SKB bounds checking semantics fails and panics:
    
    skbuff: skb_over_panic: text:ffffffff831f755b len:184 put:172 head:ffff88811f1c6c00 data:ffff88811f1c6c00 tail:0xb8 end:0x80 dev:<NULL>

    The NCM specification defines two formats of transfer blocks: with 16-bit
    fields (NTB-16) and with 32-bit fields (NTB-32). Currently only NTB-16 is
    implemented.
    
    This patch adds the support of NTB-32. The motivation behind this is that
    some devices such as E5785 or E5885 from the current generation of Huawei
    LTE routers do not support NTB-16. The previous generations of Huawei
    devices are also use NTB-32 by default.
    
    Also this patch enables NTB-32 by default for Huawei devices.
    
    During the 2019 ValdikSS made five attempts to contact Huawei to add the
    NTB-16 support to their router firmware, but they were unsuccessful.
