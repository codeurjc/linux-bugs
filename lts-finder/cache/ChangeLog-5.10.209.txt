    arm64: dts: armada-3720-turris-mox: set irq type for RTC
    
    commit fca8a117c1c9a0f8b8feed117db34cf58134dc2c upstream.
    
    The rtc on the mox shares its interrupt line with the moxtet bus. Set
    the interrupt type to be consistent between both devices. This ensures
    correct setup of the interrupt line regardless of probing order.

    i2c: s3c24xx: fix transferring more than one message in polling mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 990489e1042c6c5d6bccf56deca68f8dbeed8180 ]
    
    To properly handle ACK on the bus when transferring more than one
    message in polling mode, move the polling handling loop from
    s3c24xx_i2c_message_start() to s3c24xx_i2c_doxfer(). This way
    i2c_s3c_irq_nextbyte() is always executed till the end, properly
    acknowledging the IRQ bits and no recursive calls to
    i2c_s3c_irq_nextbyte() are made.
    
    While touching this, also fix finishing transfers in polling mode by
    using common code path and always waiting for the bus to become idle
    and disabled.

    selftests: mlxsw: qos_pfc: Adjust the test to support 8 lanes
    
    [ Upstream commit b34f4de6d30cbaa8fed905a5080b6eace8c84dc7 ]
    
    'qos_pfc' test checks PFC behavior. The idea is to limit the traffic
    using a shaper somewhere in the flow of the packets. In this area, the
    buffer is smaller than the buffer at the beginning of the flow, so it fills
    up until there is no more space left. The test configures there PFC
    which is supposed to notice that the headroom is filling up and send PFC
    Xoff to indicate the transmitter to stop sending traffic for the priorities
    sharing this PG.
    
    The Xon/Xoff threshold is auto-configured and always equal to
    2*(MTU rounded up to cell size). Even after sending the PFC Xoff packet,
    traffic will keep arriving until the transmitter receives and processes
    the PFC packet. This amount of traffic is known as the PFC delay allowance.
    
    Currently the buffer for the delay traffic is configured as 100KB. The
    MTU in the test is 10KB, therefore the threshold for Xoff is about 20KB.
    This allows 80KB extra to be stored in this buffer.
    
    8-lane ports use two buffers among which the configured buffer is split,
    the Xoff threshold then applies to each buffer in parallel.
    
    The test does not take into account the behavior of 8-lane ports, when the
    ports are configured to 400Gbps with 8 lanes or 800Gbps with 8 lanes,
    packets are dropped and the test fails.
    
    Check if the relevant ports use 8 lanes, in such case double the size of
    the buffer, as the headroom is split half-half.

    mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption
    
    [ Upstream commit 483ae90d8f976f8339cf81066312e1329f2d3706 ]
    
    When tc filters are first added to a net device, the corresponding local
    port gets bound to an ACL group in the device. The group contains a list
    of ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the
    filters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially
    evaluated until a match is found.
    
    One reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added
    with decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two
    consecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their
    key usage.
    
    In Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the
    maximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the
    register that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account
    for that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the
    rare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.
    
    Fix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what
    the firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.
    
    Add a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this
    condition is hit.

    mlxsw: spectrum_acl_erp: Fix error flow of pool allocation failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 6d6eeabcfaba2fcadf5443b575789ea606f9de83 ]
    
    Lately, a bug was found when many TC filters are added - at some point,
    several bugs are printed to dmesg [1] and the switch is crashed with
    segmentation fault.
    
    The issue starts when gen_pool_free() fails because of unexpected
    behavior - a try to free memory which is already freed, this leads to BUG()
    call which crashes the switch and makes many other bugs.
    
    Trying to track down the unexpected behavior led to a bug in eRP code. The
    function mlxsw_sp_acl_erp_table_alloc() gets a pointer to the allocated
    index, sets the value and returns an error code. When gen_pool_alloc()
    fails it returns address 0, we track it and return -ENOBUFS outside, BUT
    the call for gen_pool_alloc() already override the index in erp_table
    structure. This is a problem when such allocation is done as part of
    table expansion. This is not a new table, which will not be used in case
    of allocation failure. We try to expand eRP table and override the
    current index (non-zero) with zero. Then, it leads to an unexpected
    behavior when address 0 is freed twice. Note that address 0 is valid in
    erp_table->base_index and indeed other tables use it.
    
    gen_pool_alloc() fails in case that there is no space left in the
    pre-allocated pool, in our case, the pool is limited to
    ACL_MAX_ERPT_BANK_SIZE, which is read from hardware. When more than max
    erp entries are required, we exceed the limit and return an error, this
    error leads to "Failed to migrate vregion" print.
    
    Fix this by changing erp_table->base_index only in case of a successful
    allocation.
    
    Add a test case for such a scenario. Without this fix it causes
    segmentation fault:
    
    $ TESTS="max_erp_entries_test" ./tc_flower.sh
    ./tc_flower.sh: line 988:  1560 Segmentation fault      tc filter del dev $h2 ingress chain $i protocol ip pref $i handle $j flower &>/dev/null

    When appending "[defcmd]" to 'kdb_prompt_str', the size of the string
    already in the buffer should be taken into account.
    
    An option could be to switch from strncat() to strlcat() which does the
    correct test to avoid such an overflow.

    can't be true here.

    [ Upstream commit 6b1ca88e4bb63673dc9f9c7f23c899f22c3cb17a ]
    
    Delete from packet path relies on the garbage collector to purge

    Skip these dead elements from nf_tables_dump_setelem() path, I very
    rarely see tests/shell/testcases/maps/typeof_maps_add_delete reports
    [DUMP FAILED] showing a mismatch in the expected output with an element
    that should not be there.
    
    If the netlink dump happens before GC worker run, it might show dead
    elements in the ruleset listing.
    
    nft_rhash_get() already skips dead elements in nft_rhash_cmp(),
    therefore, it already does not show the element when getting a single
    element via netlink control plane.

    net: ravb: Fix dma_addr_t truncation in error case
    
    [ Upstream commit e327b2372bc0f18c30433ac40be07741b59231c5 ]
    
    In ravb_start_xmit(), ravb driver uses u32 variable to store result of
    dma_map_single() call. Since ravb hardware has 32-bit address fields in
    descriptors, this works properly when mapping is successful - it is
    platform's job to provide mapping addresses that fit into hardware
    limitations.
    
    However, in failure case dma_map_single() returns DMA_MAPPING_ERROR
    constant that is 64-bit when dma_addr_t is 64-bit. Storing this constant
    in u32 leads to truncation, and further call to dma_mapping_error()
    fails to notice the error.
    
    Fix that by storing result of dma_map_single() in a dma_addr_t
    variable.

    net: phy: micrel: populate .soft_reset for KSZ9131
    
    [ Upstream commit e398822c4751017fe401f57409488f5948d12fb5 ]
    
    The RZ/G3S SMARC Module has 2 KSZ9131 PHYs. In this setup, the KSZ9131 PHY
    is used with the ravb Ethernet driver. It has been discovered that when
    bringing the Ethernet interface down/up continuously, e.g., with the
    following sh script:
    
    $ while :; do ifconfig eth0 down; ifconfig eth0 up; done
    
    the link speed and duplex are wrong after interrupting the bring down/up
    operation even though the Ethernet interface is up. To recover from this
    state the following configuration sequence is necessary (executed
    manually):
    
    $ ifconfig eth0 down
    $ ifconfig eth0 up
    
    The behavior has been identified also on the Microchip SAMA7G5-EK board
    which runs the macb driver and uses the same PHY.
    
    The order of PHY-related operations in ravb_open() is as follows:
    ravb_open() ->
      ravb_phy_start() ->
        ravb_phy_init() ->
          of_phy_connect() ->
            phy_connect_direct() ->
              phy_attach_direct() ->
                phy_init_hw() ->
                  phydev->drv->soft_reset()
                  phydev->drv->config_init()
                  phydev->drv->config_intr()
                phy_resume()
                  kszphy_resume()
    
    The order of PHY-related operations in ravb_close is as follows:
    ravb_close() ->
      phy_stop() ->
        phy_suspend() ->
          kszphy_suspend() ->
            genphy_suspend()
              // set BMCR_PDOWN bit in MII_BMCR
    
    In genphy_suspend() setting the BMCR_PDWN bit in MII_BMCR switches the PHY
    to Software Power-Down (SPD) mode (according to the KSZ9131 datasheet).
    Thus, when opening the interface after it has been  previously closed (via
    ravb_close()), the phydev->drv->config_init() and
    phydev->drv->config_intr() reach the KSZ9131 PHY driver via the
    ksz9131_config_init() and kszphy_config_intr() functions.
    
    KSZ9131 specifies that the MII management interface remains operational
    during SPD (Software Power-Down), but (according to manual):
    - Only access to the standard registers (0 through 31) is supported.
    - Access to MMD address spaces other than MMD address space 1 is possible
      if the spd_clock_gate_override bit is set.
    - Access to MMD address space 1 is not possible.
    
    The spd_clock_gate_override bit is not used in the KSZ9131 driver.
    
    ksz9131_config_init() configures RGMII delay, pad skews and LEDs by
    accessesing MMD registers other than those in address space 1.
    
    The datasheet for the KSZ9131 does not specify what happens if registers
    from an unsupported address space are accessed while the PHY is in SPD.
    
    To fix the issue the .soft_reset method has been instantiated for KSZ9131,
    too. This resets the PHY to the default state before doing any
    configurations to it, thus switching it out of SPD.

    net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw: Fix max mtu to fit ethernet frames
    
    [ Upstream commit 64e47d8afb5ca533b27efc006405e5bcae2c4a7b ]
    
    The value of AM65_CPSW_MAX_PACKET_SIZE represents the maximum length
    of a received frame. This value is written to the register
    AM65_CPSW_PORT_REG_RX_MAXLEN.
    
    The maximum MTU configured on the network device should then leave
    some room for the ethernet headers and frame check. Otherwise, if
    the network interface is configured to its maximum mtu possible,
    the frames will be larger than AM65_CPSW_MAX_PACKET_SIZE and will
    get dropped as oversized.
    
    The switch supports ethernet frame sizes between 64 and 2024 bytes
    (including VLAN) as stated in the technical reference manual, so
    define AM65_CPSW_MAX_PACKET_SIZE with that maximum size.

    s390/pci: fix max size calculation in zpci_memcpy_toio()
    
    [ Upstream commit 80df7d6af7f6d229b34cf237b2cc9024c07111cd ]
    
    The zpci_get_max_write_size() helper is used to determine the maximum
    size a PCI store or load can use at a given __iomem address.
    
    For the PCI block store the following restrictions apply:
    
    1. The dst + len must not cross a 4K boundary in the (pseudo-)MMIO space
    2. len must not exceed ZPCI_MAX_WRITE_SIZE
    3. len must be a multiple of 8 bytes
    4. The src address must be double word (8 byte) aligned
    5. The dst address must be double word (8 byte) aligned
    
    Otherwise only a normal PCI store which takes its src value from
    a register can be used. For these PCI store restriction 1 still applies.
    Similarly 1 also applies to PCI loads.
    
    It turns out zpci_max_write_size() instead implements stricter
    conditions which prevents PCI block stores from being used where they
    can and should be used. In particular instead of conditions 4 and 5 it
    wrongly enforces both dst and src to be size aligned. This indirectly
    covers condition 1 but also prevents many legal PCI block stores.
    
    On top of the functional shortcomings the zpci_get_max_write_size() is
    misnamed as it is used for both read and write size calculations. Rename
    it to zpci_get_max_io_size() and implement the listed conditions
    explicitly.

    PCI: keystone: Fix race condition when initializing PHYs
    
    [ Upstream commit c12ca110c613a81cb0f0099019c839d078cd0f38 ]
    
    The PCI driver invokes the PHY APIs using the ks_pcie_enable_phy()
    function. The PHY in this case is the Serdes. It is possible that the
    PCI instance is configured for two lane operation across two different
    Serdes instances, using one lane of each Serdes.
    
    In such a configuration, if the reference clock for one Serdes is
    provided by the other Serdes, it results in a race condition. After the
    Serdes providing the reference clock is initialized by the PCI driver by
    invoking its PHY APIs, it is not guaranteed that this Serdes remains
    powered on long enough for the PHY APIs based initialization of the
    dependent Serdes. In such cases, the PLL of the dependent Serdes fails
    to lock due to the absence of the reference clock from the former Serdes
    which has been powered off by the PM Core.
    
    Fix this by obtaining reference to the PHYs before invoking the PHY
    initialization APIs and releasing reference after the initialization is
    complete.

    apparmor: avoid crash when parsed profile name is empty
    
    [ Upstream commit 55a8210c9e7d21ff2644809699765796d4bfb200 ]
    
    When processing a packed profile in unpack_profile() described like
    
     "profile :ns::samba-dcerpcd /usr/lib*/samba/{,samba/}samba-dcerpcd {...}"
    
    a string ":samba-dcerpcd" is unpacked as a fully-qualified name and then
    passed to aa_splitn_fqname().
    
    aa_splitn_fqname() treats ":samba-dcerpcd" as only containing a namespace.
    Thus it returns NULL for tmpname, meanwhile tmpns is non-NULL. Later
    aa_alloc_profile() crashes as the new profile name is NULL now.

    usb: cdc-acm: return correct error code on unsupported break
    
    [ Upstream commit 66aad7d8d3ec5a3a8ec2023841bcec2ded5f65c9 ]
    
    In ACM support for sending breaks to devices is optional.
    If a device says that it doenot support sending breaks,
    the host must respect that.
    Given the number of optional features providing tty operations
    for each combination is not practical and errors need to be
    returned dynamically if unsupported features are requested.
    
    In case a device does not support break, we want the tty layer
    to treat that like it treats drivers that statically cannot
    support sending a break. It ignores the inability and does nothing.
    This patch uses EOPNOTSUPP to indicate that.

    which does not make sense. Moreover, when trying to set a new scale we
    get an error because there's no call to __ad9467_get_scale() to give us
    values as given when reading in_voltage_scale. Fix it by computing the
    available scales during probe and properly pass the list when
    .read_available() is called.
    
    While at it, change to use .read_available() from iio_info. Also note

    iio: adc: ad9467: fix reset gpio handling
    
    [ Upstream commit 76f028539cf360f750efd8cde560edda298e4c6b ]
    
    The reset gpio was being handled with inverted polarity. This means that
    as far as gpiolib is concerned we were actually leaving the pin asserted
    (in theory, this would mean reset). However, inverting the polarity in
    devicetree made things work. Fix it by doing it the proper way and how
    gpiolib expects it to be done.
    
    While at it, moved the handling to it's own function and dropped
    'reset_gpio' from the 'struct ad9467_state' as we only need it during
    probe. On top of that, refactored things so that we now request the gpio
    asserted (i.e in reset) and then de-assert it. Also note that we now use
    gpiod_set_value_cansleep() instead of gpiod_direction_output() as we
    already request the pin as output.

    serial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock
    
    [ Upstream commit 78d60dae9a0c9f09aa3d6477c94047df2fe6f7b0 ]
    
    When using the serial port as RS485 port, the tx statemachine is used to
    control the RTS pin to drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin. When the
    TTY port is closed in the middle of a transmission (for instance during
    userland application crash), imx_uart_shutdown disables the interface
    and disables the Transmission Complete interrupt. afer that,
    imx_uart_stop_tx bails on an incomplete transmission, to be retriggered
    by the TC interrupt. This interrupt is disabled and therefore the tx
    statemachine never transitions out of SEND. The statemachine is in
    deadlock now, and the TX_EN remains low, making the interface useless.
    
    imx_uart_stop_tx now checks for incomplete transmission AND whether TC
    interrupts are enabled before bailing to be retriggered. This makes sure
    the state machine handling is reached, and is properly set to
    WAIT_AFTER_SEND.

    mips: Fix incorrect max_low_pfn adjustment
    
    [ Upstream commit 0f5cc249ff73552d3bd864e62f85841dafaa107d ]
    
    max_low_pfn variable is incorrectly adjusted if the kernel is built with
    high memory support and the later is detected in a running system, so the
    memory which actually can be directly mapped is getting into the highmem
    zone. See the ZONE_NORMAL range on my MIPS32r5 system:
    
    > Zone ranges:
    >   DMA      [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000ffffff]
    >   Normal   [mem 0x0000000001000000-0x0000000007ffffff]
    >   HighMem  [mem 0x0000000008000000-0x000000020fffffff]
    
    while the zones are supposed to look as follows:
    
    > Zone ranges:
    >   DMA      [mem 0x0000000000000000-0x0000000000ffffff]
    >   Normal   [mem 0x0000000001000000-0x000000001fffffff]
    >   HighMem  [mem 0x0000000020000000-0x000000020fffffff]
    
    Even though the physical memory within the range [0x08000000;0x20000000]
    belongs to MMIO on our system, we don't really want it to be considered as
    high memory since on MIPS32 that range still can be directly mapped.
    
    Note there might be other problems caused by the max_low_pfn variable
    misconfiguration. For instance high_memory variable is initialize with
    virtual address corresponding to the max_low_pfn PFN, and by design it
    must define the upper bound on direct map memory, then end of the normal
    zone. That in its turn potentially may cause problems in accessing the
    memory by means of the /dev/mem and /dev/kmem devices.
    
    Let's fix the discovered misconfiguration then. It turns out the commit
    a94e4f24ec83 ("MIPS: init: Drop boot_mem_map") didn't introduce the
    max_low_pfn adjustment quite correct. If the kernel is built with high
    memory support and the system is equipped with high memory, the
    max_low_pfn variable will need to be initialized with PFN of the most
    upper directly reachable memory address so the zone normal would be
    correctly setup. On MIPS that PFN corresponds to PFN_DOWN(HIGHMEM_START).
    If the system is built with no high memory support and one is detected in
    the running system, we'll just need to adjust the max_pfn variable to
    discard the found high memory from the system and leave the max_low_pfn as
    is, since the later will be less than PFN_DOWN(HIGHMEM_START) anyway by
    design of the for_each_memblock() loop performed a bit early in the
    bootmem_init() method.

    mips: dmi: Fix early remap on MIPS32
    
    [ Upstream commit 0d0a3748a2cb38f9da1f08d357688ebd982eb788 ]
    
    dmi_early_remap() has been defined as ioremap_cache() which on MIPS32 gets
    to be converted to the VM-based mapping. DMI early remapping is performed
    at the setup_arch() stage with no VM available. So calling the
    dmi_early_remap() for MIPS32 causes the system to crash at the early boot
    time. Fix that by converting dmi_early_remap() to the uncached remapping
    which is always available on both 32 and 64-bits MIPS systems.
    
    Note this change shall not cause any regressions on the current DMI
    support implementation because on the early boot-up stage neither MIPS32
    nor MIPS64 has the cacheable ioremapping support anyway.

    HID: wacom: Correct behavior when processing some confidence == false touches
    
    commit 502296030ec6b0329e00f9fb15018e170cc63037 upstream.
    
    There appear to be a few different ways that Wacom devices can deal with
    confidence:
    
      1. If the device looses confidence in a touch, it will first clear
         the tipswitch flag in one report, and then clear the confidence
         flag in a second report. This behavior is used by e.g. DTH-2452.
    
      2. If the device looses confidence in a touch, it will clear both
         the tipswitch and confidence flags within the same report. This
         behavior is used by some AES devices.
    
      3. If the device looses confidence in a touch, it will clear *only*
         the confidence bit. The tipswitch bit will remain set so long as
         the touch is tracked. This behavior may be used in future devices.
    
    The driver does not currently handle situation 3 properly. Touches that
    loose confidence will remain "in prox" and essentially frozen in place
    until the tipswitch bit is finally cleared. Not only does this result
    in userspace seeing a stuck touch, but it also prevents pen arbitration
    from working properly (the pen won't send events until all touches are
    up, but we don't currently process events from non-confident touches).
    
    This commit centralizes the checking of the confidence bit in the
    wacom_wac_finger_slot() function and has 'prox' depend on it. In the

    iio: adc: ad7091r: Pass iio_dev to event handler
    
    commit a25a7df518fc71b1ba981d691e9322e645d2689c upstream.
    
    Previous version of ad7091r event handler received the ADC state pointer
    and retrieved the iio device from driver data field with dev_get_drvdata().
    However, no driver data have ever been set, which led to null pointer
    dereference when running the event handler.
    
    Pass the iio device to the event handler and retrieve the ADC state struct
    from it so we avoid the null pointer dereference and save the driver from
    filling the driver data field.

    KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Avoid potential UAF in LPI translation cache
    
    commit ad362fe07fecf0aba839ff2cc59a3617bd42c33f upstream.
    
    There is a potential UAF scenario in the case of an LPI translation
    cache hit racing with an operation that invalidates the cache, such
    as a DISCARD ITS command. The root of the problem is that
    vgic_its_check_cache() does not elevate the refcount on the vgic_irq
    before dropping the lock that serializes refcount changes.
    
    Have vgic_its_check_cache() raise the refcount on the returned vgic_irq
    and add the corresponding decrement after queueing the interrupt.

    KVM: arm64: vgic-v4: Restore pending state on host userspace write
    
    commit 7b95382f965133ef61ce44aaabc518c16eb46909 upstream.
    
    When the VMM writes to ISPENDR0 to set the state pending state of
    an SGI, we fail to convey this to the HW if this SGI is already
    backed by a GICv4.1 vSGI.
    
    This is a bit of a corner case, as this would only occur if the
    vgic state is changed on an already running VM, but this can
    apparently happen across a guest reset driven by the VMM.
    
    Fix this by always writing out the pending_latch value to the
    HW, and reseting it to false.

    wifi: mwifiex: configure BSSID consistently when starting AP
    
    commit f0dd488e11e71ac095df7638d892209c629d9af2 upstream.
    
    AP BSSID configuration is missing at AP start.  Without this fix, FW returns
    STA interface MAC address after first init.  When hostapd restarts, it gets MAC
    address from netdev before driver sets STA MAC to netdev again. Now MAC address
    between hostapd and net interface are different causes STA cannot connect to
    AP.  After that MAC address of uap0 mlan0 become the same. And issue disappears
    after following hostapd restart (another issue is AP/STA MAC address become the
    same).
    
    This patch fixes the issue cleanly.

    wifi: rtlwifi: Remove bogus and dangerous ASPM disable/enable code
    
    commit b3943b3c2971444364e03224cfc828c5789deada upstream.
    
    Ever since introduction in the commit 0c8173385e54 ("rtl8192ce: Add new
    driver") the rtlwifi code has, according to comments, attempted to
    disable/enable ASPM of the upstream bridge by writing into its LNKCTL
    register. However, the code has never been correct because it performs
    the writes to the device instead of the upstream bridge.
    
    Worse yet, the offset where the PCIe capabilities reside is derived
    from the offset of the upstream bridge. As a result, the write will use
    an offset on the device that does not relate to the LNKCTL register
    making the ASPM disable/enable code outright dangerous.
    
    Because of those problems, there is no indication that the driver needs
    disable/enable ASPM on the upstream bridge. As the Capabilities offset
    is not correctly calculated for the write to target device's LNKCTL
    register, the code is not disabling/enabling device's ASPM either.
    Therefore, just remove the upstream bridge related ASPM disable/enable
    code entirely.
    
    The upstream bridge related ASPM code was the only user of the struct
    mp_adapter members num4bytes, pcibridge_pciehdr_offset, and
    pcibridge_linkctrlreg so those are removed as well.
    
    Note: This change does not remove the code related to changing the
    device's ASPM on purpose (which is independent of this flawed code
    related to upstream bridge's ASPM).

    iommu/arm-smmu-qcom: Add missing GMU entry to match table
    
    commit afc95681c3068956fed1241a1ff1612c066c75ac upstream.
    
    In some cases the firmware expects cbndx 1 to be assigned to the GMU,
    so we also want the default domain for the GMU to be an identy domain.
    This way it does not get a context bank assigned.  Without this, both
    of_dma_configure() and drm/msm's iommu_domain_attach() will trigger
    allocating and configuring a context bank.  So GMU ends up attached to
    both cbndx 1 and later cbndx 2.  This arrangement seemingly confounds
    and surprises the firmware if the GPU later triggers a translation
    fault, resulting (on sc8280xp / lenovo x13s, at least) in the SMMU
    getting wedged and the GPU stuck without memory access.

    Bluetooth: Fix atomicity violation in {min,max}_key_size_set
    
    commit da9065caa594d19b26e1a030fd0cc27bd365d685 upstream.
    
    In min_key_size_set():
        if (val > hdev->le_max_key_size || val < SMP_MIN_ENC_KEY_SIZE)
            return -EINVAL;
        hci_dev_lock(hdev);
        hdev->le_min_key_size = val;
        hci_dev_unlock(hdev);
    
    In max_key_size_set():
        if (val > SMP_MAX_ENC_KEY_SIZE || val < hdev->le_min_key_size)
            return -EINVAL;
        hci_dev_lock(hdev);
        hdev->le_max_key_size = val;
        hci_dev_unlock(hdev);
    
    The atomicity violation occurs due to concurrent execution of set_min and
    set_max funcs.Consider a scenario where setmin writes a new, valid 'min'
    value, and concurrently, setmax writes a value that is greater than the
    old 'min' but smaller than the new 'min'. In this case, setmax might check
    against the old 'min' value (before acquiring the lock) but write its
    value after the 'min' has been updated by setmin. This leads to a
    situation where the 'max' value ends up being smaller than the 'min'
    value, which is an inconsistency.
    
    This possible bug is found by an experimental static analysis tool
    developed by our team, BassCheck[1]. This tool analyzes the locking APIs
    to extract function pairs that can be concurrently executed, and then
    analyzes the instructions in the paired functions to identify possible
    concurrency bugs including data races and atomicity violations. The above
    possible bug is reported when our tool analyzes the source code of
    Linux 5.17.
    
    To resolve this issue, it is suggested to encompass the validity checks
    within the locked sections in both set_min and set_max funcs. The
    modification ensures that the validation of 'val' against the
    current min/max values is atomic, thus maintaining the integrity of the
    settings. With this patch applied, our tool no longer reports the bug,
    with the kernel configuration allyesconfig for x86_64. Due to the lack of
    associated hardware, we cannot test the patch in runtime testing, and just
    verify it according to the code logic.

    rootfs: Fix support for rootfstype= when root= is given
    
    commit 21528c69a0d8483f7c6345b1a0bc8d8975e9a172 upstream.
    
    Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.rst states:
    
      If CONFIG_TMPFS is enabled, rootfs will use tmpfs instead of ramfs by
      default.  To force ramfs, add "rootfstype=ramfs" to the kernel command
      line.
    
    This currently does not work when root= is provided since then
    saved_root_name contains a string and rootfstype= is ignored. Therefore,
    ramfs is currently always chosen when root= is provided.
    
    The current behavior for rootfs's filesystem is:
    
       root=       | rootfstype= | chosen rootfs filesystem
       ------------+-------------+--------------------------
       unspecified | unspecified | tmpfs
       unspecified | tmpfs       | tmpfs
       unspecified | ramfs       | ramfs
        provided   | ignored     | ramfs
    
    rootfstype= should be respected regardless whether root= is given,
    as shown below:
    
       root=       | rootfstype= | chosen rootfs filesystem
       ------------+-------------+--------------------------
       unspecified | unspecified | tmpfs  (as before)
       unspecified | tmpfs       | tmpfs  (as before)
       unspecified | ramfs       | ramfs  (as before)
        provided   | unspecified | ramfs  (compatibility with before)
        provided   | tmpfs       | tmpfs  (new)
        provided   | ramfs       | ramfs  (new)
    
    This table represents the new behavior.

    dev_err_probe() is only supposed to be used in probe functions. While it
    probably doesn't hurt, both the EPROBE_DEFER handling and calling
    device_set_deferred_probe_reason() are conceptually wrong in the request

    fbdev: flush deferred work in fb_deferred_io_fsync()
    
    commit 15e4c1f462279b4e128f27de48133e0debe9e0df upstream.
    
    The driver's fsync() is supposed to flush any pending operation to
    hardware. It is implemented in this driver by cancelling the queued
    deferred IO first, then schedule it for "immediate execution" by calling
    schedule_delayed_work() again with delay=0. However, setting delay=0
    only means the work is scheduled immediately, it does not mean the work
    is executed immediately. There is no guarantee that the work is finished
    after schedule_delayed_work() returns. After this driver's fsync()
    returns, there can still be pending work. Furthermore, if close() is
    called by users immediately after fsync(), the pending work gets
    cancelled and fsync() may do nothing.
    
    To ensure that the deferred IO completes, use flush_delayed_work()
    instead. Write operations to this driver either write to the device
    directly, or invoke schedule_delayed_work(); so by flushing the
    workqueue, it can be guaranteed that all previous writes make it to the
    device.

    ALSA: oxygen: Fix right channel of capture volume mixer
    
    commit a03cfad512ac24a35184d7d87ec0d5489e1cb763 upstream.
    
    There was a typo in oxygen mixer code that didn't update the right
    channel value properly for the capture volume.  Let's fix it.
    
    This trivial fix was originally reported on Bugzilla.

    serial: imx: Ensure that imx_uart_rs485_config() is called with enabled clock
    
    commit 7c45eaa813476bd195ac1227a64b52f9cf2e2030 upstream.
    
    There are register accesses in the function imx_uart_rs485_config(). The
    clock must be enabled for these accesses. This was ensured by calling it
    via the function uart_rs485_config() in the probe() function within the
    range where the clock is enabled. With the commit 7c7f9bc986e6 ("serial:
    Deassert Transmit Enable on probe in driver-specific way") it was removed
    from the probe() function and is now only called through the function
    uart_add_one_port() which is located at the end of the probe() function.
    But the clock is already switched off in this area. To ensure that the
    clock is enabled during register access, move the disabling of the clock
    to the very end of the probe() function. To avoid leaking enabled clocks
    on error also add an error path for exiting with disabling the clock.

    usb: mon: Fix atomicity violation in mon_bin_vma_fault
    
    commit 2dd23cc4d0e6aa55cf9fb3b05f2f4165b01de81c upstream.
    
    In mon_bin_vma_fault():
        offset = vmf->pgoff << PAGE_SHIFT;
        if (offset >= rp->b_size)
            return VM_FAULT_SIGBUS;
        chunk_idx = offset / CHUNK_SIZE;
        pageptr = rp->b_vec[chunk_idx].pg;
    The code is executed without holding any lock.
    
    In mon_bin_vma_close():
        spin_lock_irqsave(&rp->b_lock, flags);
        rp->mmap_active--;
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&rp->b_lock, flags);
    
    In mon_bin_ioctl():
        spin_lock_irqsave(&rp->b_lock, flags);
        if (rp->mmap_active) {
            ...
        } else {
            ...
            kfree(rp->b_vec);
            rp->b_vec  = vec;
            rp->b_size = size;
            ...
        }
        spin_unlock_irqrestore(&rp->b_lock, flags);
    
    Concurrent execution of mon_bin_vma_fault() with mon_bin_vma_close() and
    mon_bin_ioctl() could lead to atomicity violations. mon_bin_vma_fault()
    accesses rp->b_size and rp->b_vec without locking, risking array
    out-of-bounds access or use-after-free bugs due to possible modifications
    in mon_bin_ioctl().
    
    This possible bug is found by an experimental static analysis tool
    developed by our team, BassCheck[1]. This tool analyzes the locking APIs
    to extract function pairs that can be concurrently executed, and then
    analyzes the instructions in the paired functions to identify possible
    concurrency bugs including data races and atomicity violations. The above
    possible bug is reported when our tool analyzes the source code of
    Linux 6.2.
    
    To address this issue, it is proposed to add a spin lock pair in
    mon_bin_vma_fault() to ensure atomicity. With this patch applied, our tool
    never reports the possible bug, with the kernel configuration allyesconfig
    for x86_64. Due to the lack of associated hardware, we cannot test the
    patch in runtime testing, and just verify it according to the code logic.

    usb: typec: class: fix typec_altmode_put_partner to put plugs
    
    commit 5962ded777d689cd8bf04454273e32228d7fb71f upstream.
    
    When typec_altmode_put_partner is called by a plug altmode upon release,
    the port altmode the plug belongs to will not remove its reference to the
    plug. The check to see if the altmode being released is a plug evaluates
    against the released altmode's partner instead of the calling altmode, so
    change adev in typec_altmode_put_partner to properly refer to the altmode
    being released.
    
    Because typec_altmode_set_partner calls get_device() on the port altmode,
    add partner_adev that points to the port altmode in typec_put_partner to
    call put_device() on. typec_altmode_set_partner is not called for port
    altmodes, so add a check in typec_altmode_release to prevent
    typec_altmode_put_partner() calls on port altmode release.

    usb: chipidea: wait controller resume finished for wakeup irq
    
    commit 128d849074d05545becf86e713715ce7676fc074 upstream.
    
    After the chipidea driver introduce extcon for id and vbus, it's able
    to wakeup from another irq source, in case the system with extcon ID
    cable, wakeup from usb ID cable and device removal, the usb device
    disconnect irq may come firstly before the extcon notifier while system
    resume, so we will get 2 "wakeup" irq, one for usb device disconnect;
    and one for extcon ID cable change(real wakeup event), current driver
    treat them as 2 successive wakeup irq so can't handle it correctly, then
    finally the usb irq can't be enabled. This patch adds a check to bypass
    further usb events before controller resume finished to fix it.

    commit afe28cd686aeb77e8d9140d50fb1cf06a7ecb731 upstream.
    
    This reverts commit e835c0a4e23c38531dcee5ef77e8d1cf462658c7.
    
    Don't omit soft-reset. During initialization, the driver may need to
    perform a soft reset to ensure the phy is ready when the controller
    updates the GCTL.PRTCAPDIR or other settings by issuing phy soft-reset.
    Many platforms often have access to DCTL register for soft-reset despite
    being host-only. If there are actual reported issues from the platforms
    that don't expose DCTL registers, then we will need to revisit (perhaps
    to teach dwc3 to perform xhci's soft-reset USBCMD.HCRST).

    Current implementation blocks the running operations when Plug-out and
    Plug-In is performed continuously, process gets stuck in
    dwc3_thread_interrupt().
    
    Code Flow:
    
            CPU1
    
            ->Gadget_start
            ->dwc3_interrupt

            ->dwc3_ep0_stall_and_restart
    
    By this time if pending_list is not empty, it will get the next request
    on the given list and calls dwc3_gadget_giveback which will unmap request
    and call its complete() callback to notify upper layers that it has
    completed. Currently dwc3_gadget_giveback status is set to -ECONNRESET,
    whereas it should be -ESHUTDOWN based on condition if not dwc->connected
    is true.

    tick-sched: Fix idle and iowait sleeptime accounting vs CPU hotplug
    
    commit 71fee48fb772ac4f6cfa63dbebc5629de8b4cc09 upstream.
    
    When offlining and onlining CPUs the overall reported idle and iowait
    times as reported by /proc/stat jump backward and forward:
    
    cpu  132 0 176 225249 47 6 6 21 0 0
    cpu0 80 0 115 112575 33 3 4 18 0 0
    cpu1 52 0 60 112673 13 3 1 2 0 0
    
    cpu  133 0 177 226681 47 6 6 21 0 0
    cpu0 80 0 116 113387 33 3 4 18 0 0
    
    cpu  133 0 178 114431 33 6 6 21 0 0 <---- jump backward
    cpu0 80 0 116 114247 33 3 4 18 0 0
    cpu1 52 0 61 183 0 3 1 2 0 0        <---- idle + iowait start with 0
    
    cpu  133 0 178 228956 47 6 6 21 0 0 <---- jump forward
    cpu0 81 0 117 114929 33 3 4 18 0 0
    
    Reason for this is that get_idle_time() in fs/proc/stat.c has different
    sources for both values depending on if a CPU is online or offline:
    
    - if a CPU is online the values may be taken from its per cpu
      tick_cpu_sched structure
    
    - if a CPU is offline the values are taken from its per cpu cpustat
      structure
    
    The problem is that the per cpu tick_cpu_sched structure is set to zero on
    CPU offline. See tick_cancel_sched_timer() in kernel/time/tick-sched.c.
    
    Therefore when a CPU is brought offline and online afterwards both its idle
    and iowait sleeptime will be zero, causing a jump backward in total system
    idle and iowait sleeptime. In a similar way if a CPU is then brought
    offline again the total idle and iowait sleeptimes will jump forward.
    
    It looks like this behavior was introduced with commit 4b0c0f294f60
    ("tick: Cleanup NOHZ per cpu data on cpu down").
    
    This was only noticed now on s390, since we switched to generic idle time
    reporting with commit be76ea614460 ("s390/idle: remove arch_cpu_idle_time()
    and corresponding code").
    
    Fix this by preserving the values of idle_sleeptime and iowait_sleeptime
    members of the per-cpu tick_sched structure on CPU hotplug.

    binder: fix race between mmput() and do_exit()
    
    commit 9a9ab0d963621d9d12199df9817e66982582d5a5 upstream.
    
    Task A calls binder_update_page_range() to allocate and insert pages on
    a remote address space from Task B. For this, Task A pins the remote mm
    via mmget_not_zero() first. This can race with Task B do_exit() and the
    final mmput() refcount decrement will come from Task A.
    
      Task A            | Task B

          remove_vma()  |
            fput()      |
    
    In this case, the work of ____fput() from Task B is queued up in Task A
    as TWA_RESUME. So in theory, Task A returns to userspace and the cleanup
    work gets executed. However, Task A instead sleep, waiting for a reply
    from Task B that never comes (it's dead).
    
    This means the binder_deferred_release() is blocked until an unrelated
    binder event forces Task A to go back to userspace. All the associated
    death notifications will also be delayed until then.
    
    In order to fix this use mmput_async() that will schedule the work in
    the corresponding mm->async_put_work WQ instead of Task A.

    xen-netback: don't produce zero-size SKB frags
    
    commit c7ec4f2d684e17d69bbdd7c4324db0ef5daac26a upstream.
    
    While frontends may submit zero-size requests (wasting a precious slot),
    core networking code as of at least 3ece782693c4b ("sock: skb_copy_ubufs
    support for compound pages") can't deal with SKBs when they have all
    zero-size fragments. Respond to empty requests right when populating
    fragments; all further processing is fragment based and hence won't
    encounter these empty requests anymore.
    
    In a way this should have been that way from the beginning: When no data
    is to be transferred for a particular request, there's not even a point
    in validating the respective grant ref. That's no different from e.g.
    passing NULL into memcpy() when at the same time the size is 0.
    
    This is XSA-448 / CVE-2023-46838.

    kprobes: Fix to handle forcibly unoptimized kprobes on freeing_list
    
    commit 4fbd2f83fda0ca44a2ec6421ca3508b355b31858 upstream.
    
    Since forcibly unoptimized kprobes will be put on the freeing_list directly
    in the unoptimize_kprobe(), do_unoptimize_kprobes() must continue to check
    the freeing_list even if unoptimizing_list is empty.
    
    This bug can happen if a kprobe is put in an instruction which is in the
    middle of the jump-replaced instruction sequence of an optprobe, *and* the
    optprobe is recently unregistered and queued on unoptimizing_list.
    In this case, the optprobe will be unoptimized forcibly (means immediately)
    and put it into the freeing_list, expecting the optprobe will be handled in
    do_unoptimize_kprobe().
    But if there is no other optprobes on the unoptimizing_list, current code
    returns from the do_unoptimize_kprobe() soon and does not handle the
    optprobe which is on the freeing_list. Then the optprobe will hit the
    WARN_ON_ONCE() in the do_free_cleaned_kprobes(), because it is not handled
    in the latter loop of the do_unoptimize_kprobe().
    
    To solve this issue, do not return from do_unoptimize_kprobes() immediately
    even if unoptimizing_list is empty.
    
    Moreover, this change affects another case. kill_optimized_kprobes() expects
    kprobe_optimizer() will just free the optprobe on freeing_list.
    So I changed it to just do list_move() to freeing_list if optprobes are on
    unoptimizing list. And the do_unoptimize_kprobe() will skip
    arch_disarm_kprobe() if the probe on freeing_list has gone flag.

    Use the standard ab83 id for keyboards when getid is skipped
    (rather then that getid fails) to avoid reporting a different
    Version to userspace then before skipping the getid.

    binder: fix use-after-free in shinker's callback
    
    commit 3f489c2067c5824528212b0fc18b28d51332d906 upstream.
    
    The mmap read lock is used during the shrinker's callback, which means
    that using alloc->vma pointer isn't safe as it can race with munmap().
    As of commit dd2283f2605e ("mm: mmap: zap pages with read mmap_sem in
    munmap") the mmap lock is downgraded after the vma has been isolated.
    
    I was able to reproduce this issue by manually adding some delays and
    triggering page reclaiming through the shrinker's debug sysfs. The
    following KASAN report confirms the UAF:

    Fix this issue by performing instead a vma_lookup() which will fail to
    find the vma that was isolated before the mmap lock downgrade. Note that
    this option has better performance than upgrading to a mmap write lock
    which would increase contention. Plus, mmap_write_trylock() has been
    recently removed anyway.

    binder: fix unused alloc->free_async_space
    
    commit c6d05e0762ab276102246d24affd1e116a46aa0c upstream.
    
    Each transaction is associated with a 'struct binder_buffer' that stores
    the metadata about its buffer area. Since commit 74310e06be4d ("android:
    binder: Move buffer out of area shared with user space") this struct is
    no longer embedded within the buffer itself but is instead allocated on
    the heap to prevent userspace access to this driver-exclusive info.
    
    Unfortunately, the space of this struct is still being accounted for in
    the total buffer size calculation, specifically for async transactions.
    This results in an additional 104 bytes added to every async buffer
    request, and this area is never used.
    
    This wasted space can be substantial. If we consider the maximum mmap
    buffer space of SZ_4M, the driver will reserve half of it for async
    transactions, or 0x200000. This area should, in theory, accommodate up
    to 262,144 buffers of the minimum 8-byte size. However, after adding
    the extra 'sizeof(struct binder_buffer)', the total number of buffers
    drops to only 18,724, which is a sad 7.14% of the actual capacity.
    
    This patch fixes the buffer size calculation to enable the utilization
    of the entire async buffer space. This is expected to reduce the number
    of -ENOSPC errors that are seen on the field.

    keys, dns: Fix size check of V1 server-list header
    
    commit acc657692aed438e9931438f8c923b2b107aebf9 upstream.
    
    Fix the size check added to dns_resolver_preparse() for the V1 server-list
    header so that it doesn't give EINVAL if the size supplied is the same as
    the size of the header struct (which should be valid).
    
    This can be tested with:
    
            echo -n -e '\0\0\01\xff\0\0' | keyctl padd dns_resolver desc @p
    
    which will give "add_key: Invalid argument" without this fix.

    In of_parse_phandle_with_args_map() the inner loop that
    iterates through the map entries calls of_node_put(new)
    to free the reference acquired by the previous iteration
    of the inner loop. This assumes that the value of "new" is
    NULL on the first iteration of the inner loop.
    
    Make sure that this is true in all iterations of the outer
    loop by setting "new" to NULL after its value is assigned to "cur".
    
    Extend the unittest to detect the double free and add an additional
    test case that actually triggers this path.

    IB/iser: Prevent invalidating wrong MR
    
    [ Upstream commit 2f1888281e67205bd80d3e8f54dbd519a9653f26 ]
    
    The iser_reg_resources structure has two pointers to MR but only one
    mr_valid field. The implementation assumes that we use only *sig_mr when
    pi_enable is true. Otherwise, we use only *mr. However, it is only
    sometimes correct. Read commands without protection information occur even
    when pi_enble is true. For example, the following SCSI commands have a
    Data-In buffer but never have protection information: READ CAPACITY (16),
    INQUIRY, MODE SENSE(6), MAINTENANCE IN. So, we use
    *sig_mr for some SCSI commands and *mr for the other SCSI commands.
    
    In most cases, it works fine because the remote invalidation is applied.
    However, there are two cases when the remote invalidation is not
    applicable.
     1. Small write commands when all data is sent as an immediate.
     2. The target does not support the remote invalidation feature.
    
    The lazy invalidation is used if the remote invalidation is impossible.
    Since, at the lazy invalidation, we always invalidate the MR we want to
    use, the wrong MR may be invalidated.
    
    To fix the issue, we need a field per MR that indicates the MR needs
    invalidation. Since the ib_mr structure already has such a field, let's
    use ib_mr.need_inval instead of iser_reg_resources.mr_valid.

    Users report about the unexpected behavior for setting timeouts above

    watchdog/hpwdt: Only claim UNKNOWN NMI if from iLO
    
    [ Upstream commit dced0b3e51dd2af3730efe14dd86b5e3173f0a65 ]
    
    Avoid unnecessary crashes by claiming only NMIs that are due to
    ERROR signalling or generated by the hpwdt hardware device.
    
    The code does this, but only for iLO5.
    
    The intent was to preserve legacy, Gen9 and earlier, semantics of
    using hpwdt for error containtment as hardware/firmware would signal
    fatal IO errors as an NMI with the expectation of hpwdt crashing
    the system.  Howerver, these IO errors should be received by hpwdt
    as an NMI_IO_CHECK.  So the test is overly permissive and should
    not be limited to only ilo5.
    
    We need to enable this protection for future iLOs not matching the
    current PCI IDs.

    watchdog: set cdev owner before adding
    
    [ Upstream commit 38d75297745f04206db9c29bdd75557f0344c7cc ]
    
    When the new watchdog character device is registered, it becomes
    available for opening. This creates a race where userspace may open the
    device before the character device's owner is set. This results in an
    imbalance in module_get calls as the cdev_get in cdev_open will not
    increment the reference count on the watchdog driver module.
    
    This causes problems when the watchdog character device is released as
    the module loader's reference will also be released. This makes it
    impossible to open the watchdog device later on as it now appears that
    the module is being unloaded. The open will fail with -ENXIO from
    chrdev_open.
    
    The legacy watchdog device will fail with -EBUSY from the try_module_get
    in watchdog_open because it's module owner is the watchdog core module
    so it can still be opened but it will fail to get a refcount on the
    underlying watchdog device driver.

    parent rate and not selecting best parent rate from that. So use common
    divider_round_rate() which is traversing through all clock parents and
    its rate and calculating proper parent rate.

    drivers: clk: zynqmp: calculate closest mux rate
    
    [ Upstream commit b782921ddd7f84f524723090377903f399fdbbcb ]
    
    Currently zynqmp clock driver is not calculating closest mux rate and
    because of that Linux is not setting proper frequency for CPU and
    not able to set given frequency for dynamic frequency scaling.
    
    E.g., In current logic initial acpu clock parent and frequency as below
    apll1                  0    0    0  2199999978    0     0  50000      Y
        acpu0_mux          0    0    0  2199999978    0     0  50000      Y
            acpu0_idiv1    0    0    0  2199999978    0     0  50000      Y
                acpu0      0    0    0  2199999978    0     0  50000      Y
    
    After changing acpu frequency to 549999994 Hz using CPU freq scaling its
    selecting incorrect parent which is not closest frequency.
    rpll_to_xpd            0    0    0  1599999984    0     0  50000      Y
        acpu0_mux          0    0    0  1599999984    0     0  50000      Y
            acpu0_div1     0    0    0   533333328    0     0  50000      Y
                acpu0      0    0    0   533333328    0     0  50000      Y
    
    Parent should remain same since 549999994 = 2199999978 / 4.
    
    So use __clk_mux_determine_rate_closest() generic function to calculate
    closest rate for mux clock. After this change its selecting correct
    parent and correct clock rate.
    apll1                  0    0    0  2199999978    0     0  50000      Y

            acpu0_div1     0    0    0   549999995    0     0  50000      Y
                acpu0      0    0    0   549999995    0     0  50000      Y

    [ Upstream commit 28dd788382c43b330480f57cd34cde0840896743 ]
    
    When ps allocated by kzalloc equals to NULL, kv_parse_power_table
    frees adev->pm.dpm.ps that allocated before. However, after the control
    flow goes through the following call chains:
    
    kv_parse_power_table

            |-> kv_dpm_sw_init
                  |-> kv_dpm_fini
    
    The adev->pm.dpm.ps is used in the for loop of kv_dpm_fini after its
    first free in kv_parse_power_table and causes a use-after-free bug.

    When the allocation of

    label dpm_failed and calls si_dpm_fini, which calls
    amdgpu_free_extended_power_table again and free those fields again. Thus

    Upon module load, a kthread is created targeting the
    pvr2_context_thread_func function, which may call pvr2_context_destroy
    and thus call kfree() on the context object. However, that might happen
    before the usb hub_event handler is able to notify the driver. This
    patch adds a sanity check before the invalid read reported by syzbot,
    within the context disconnection call stack.

    drm/nouveau/fence:: fix warning directly dereferencing a rcu pointer
    
    [ Upstream commit 5f35a624c1e30b5bae5023b3c256e94e0ad4f806 ]
    
    Fix a sparse warning with this message
    "warning:dereference of noderef expression". In this context it means we
    are dereferencing a __rcu tagged pointer directly.
    
    We should not be directly dereferencing a rcu pointer. To get a normal
    (non __rcu tagged pointer) from a __rcu tagged pointer we are using the
    function unrcu_pointer(...). The non __rcu tagged pointer then can be
    dereferenced just like a normal pointer.

    rcu: Create an unrcu_pointer() to remove __rcu from a pointer
    
    [ Upstream commit 76c8eaafe4f061f3790112842a2fbb297e4bea88 ]
    
    The xchg() and cmpxchg() functions are sometimes used to carry out RCU
    updates.  Unfortunately, this can result in sparse warnings for both
    the old-value and new-value arguments, as well as for the return value.
    The arguments can be dealt with using RCU_INITIALIZER():
    
            old_p = xchg(&p, RCU_INITIALIZER(new_p));
    
    But a sparse warning still remains due to assigning the __rcu pointer
    returned from xchg to the (most likely) non-__rcu pointer old_p.
    
    This commit therefore provides an unrcu_pointer() macro that strips
    the __rcu.  This macro can be used as follows:
    
            old_p = unrcu_pointer(xchg(&p, RCU_INITIALIZER(new_p)));

    [ Upstream commit 03c5b2a5f6c39fe4e090346536cf1c14ee18b61e ]
    
    For devices like the Anbernic RG351M and RG351P the panel is wired to
    an always on regulator. When the device suspends and wakes up, there
    are some slight artifacts on the screen that go away over time. If
    instead we hold the panel in reset status after it is unprepared,
    this does not happen.

    RDMA/usnic: Silence uninitialized symbol smatch warnings
    
    [ Upstream commit b9a85e5eec126d6ae6c362f94b447c223e8fe6e4 ]
    
    The patch 1da177e4c3f4: "Linux-2.6.12-rc2" from Apr 16, 2005
    (linux-next), leads to the following Smatch static checker warning:

    [ Upstream commit 64057f051f20c2a2184b9db7f8037d928d68a4f4 ]
    
    Serdev recv_buf() callback is supposed to return the amount of bytes
    consumed, therefore an int in between 0 and count.
    
    Do not return negative number in case of issue, just print an error and
    return count. This fixes a WARN in ttyport_receive_buf().

    netfilter: nf_tables: mark newset as dead on transaction abort
    
    [ Upstream commit 08e4c8c5919fd405a4d709b4ba43d836894a26eb ]
    
    If a transaction is aborted, we should mark the to-be-released NEWSET dead,
    just like commit path does for DEL and DESTROYSET commands.
    
    In both cases all remaining elements will be released via
    set->ops->destroy().
    
    The existing abort code does NOT post the actual release to the work queue.
    Also the entire __nf_tables_abort() function is wrapped in gc_seq
    begin/end pair.
    
    Therefore, async gc worker will never try to release the pending set
    elements, as gc sequence is always stale.
    
    It might be possible to speed up transaction aborts via work queue too,
    this would result in a race and a possible use-after-free.
    
    So fix this before it becomes an issue.

    Add one more condition for sending credit update during dequeue from

    SO_RCVLOWAT value of the socket. This is actual for non-default value
    of SO_RCVLOWAT (e.g. not 1) - idea is to "kick" peer to continue data
    transmission, because we need at least SO_RCVLOWAT bytes in our rx
    queue to wake up user for reading data (in corner case it is also
    possible to stuck both tx and rx sides, this is why 'Fixes' is used).

    bpf: Fix verification of indirect var-off stack access
    
    [ Upstream commit a833a17aeac73b33f79433d7cee68d5cafd71e4f ]
    
    This patch fixes a bug around the verification of possibly-zero-sized
    stack accesses. When the access was done through a var-offset stack
    pointer, check_stack_access_within_bounds was incorrectly computing the
    maximum-offset of a zero-sized read to be the same as the register's min
    offset. Instead, we have to take in account the register's maximum
    possible value. The patch also simplifies how the max offset is checked;
    the check is now simpler than for min offset.
    
    The bug was allowing accesses to erroneously pass the
    check_stack_access_within_bounds() checks, only to later crash in
    check_stack_range_initialized() when all the possibly-affected stack
    slots are iterated (this time with a correct max offset).
    check_stack_range_initialized() is relying on
    check_stack_access_within_bounds() for its accesses to the
    stack-tracking vector to be within bounds; in the case of zero-sized
    accesses, we were essentially only verifying that the lowest possible
    slot was within bounds. We would crash when the max-offset of the stack
    pointer was >= 0 (which shouldn't pass verification, and hopefully is
    not something anyone's code attempts to do in practice).
    
    Thanks Hao for reporting!

    When register is spilled onto a stack as a 1/2/4-byte register, we set
    slot_type[BPF_REG_SIZE - 1] (plus potentially few more below it,
    depending on actual spill size). So to check if some stack slot has
    spilled register we need to consult slot_type[7], not slot_type[0].
    
    To avoid the need to remember and double-check this in the future, just
    use is_spilled_reg() helper.

    [ Upstream commit b57160859263c083c49482b0d083a586b1517f78 ]
    
    DSS irq trigger type is set to IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING in the DT file, but
    the TRM says it is level triggered.
    
    For some reason triggering on rising edge results in double the amount
    of expected interrupts, e.g. for normal page flipping test the number of
    interrupts per second is 2 * fps. It is as if the IRQ triggers on both
    edges. There are no other side effects to this issue than slightly
    increased CPU & power consumption due to the extra interrupt.
    
    Switching to IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH is correct and fixes the issue, so
    let's do that.

    firmware: meson_sm: populate platform devices from sm device tree data
    
    [ Upstream commit e45f243409db98d610248c843b25435e7fb0baf3 ]
    
    In some meson boards, secure monitor device has children, for example,
    power secure controller. By default, secure monitor isn't the bus in terms
    of device tree subsystem, so the of_platform initialization code doesn't
    populate its device tree data. As a result, secure monitor's children
    aren't probed at all.
    
    Run the 'of_platform_populate()' routine manually to resolve such issues.

    net/ncsi: Fix netlink major/minor version numbers
    
    [ Upstream commit 3084b58bfd0b9e4b5e034f31f31b42977db35f12 ]
    
    The netlink interface for major and minor version numbers doesn't actually
    return the major and minor version numbers.
    
    It reports a u32 that contains the (major, minor, update, alpha1)
    components as the major version number, and then alpha2 as the minor
    version number.
    
    For whatever reason, the u32 byte order was reversed (ntohl): maybe it was
    assumed that the encoded value was a single big-endian u32, and alpha2 was
    the minor version.
    
    The correct way to get the supported NC-SI version from the network
    controller is to parse the Get Version ID response as described in 8.4.44
    of the NC-SI spec[1].
    
        Get Version ID Response Packet Format
    
                  Bits
                +--------+--------+--------+--------+
         Bytes  | 31..24 | 23..16 | 15..8  | 7..0   |
        +-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
        | 0..15 | NC-SI Header                      |
        +-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
        | 16..19| Response code   | Reason code     |
        +-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
        |20..23 | Major  | Minor  | Update | Alpha1 |
        +-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
        |24..27 |         reserved         | Alpha2 |
        +-------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
        |            .... other stuff ....          |
    
    The major, minor, and update fields are all binary-coded decimal (BCD)
    encoded [2]. The spec provides examples below the Get Version ID response
    format in section 8.4.44.1, but for practical purposes, this is an example
    from a live network card:
    
        root@bmc:~# ncsi-util 0x15
        NC-SI Command Response:
        cmd: GET_VERSION_ID(0x15)
        Response: COMMAND_COMPLETED(0x0000)  Reason: NO_ERROR(0x0000)
        Payload length = 40
    
        20: 0xf1 0xf1 0xf0 0x00 <<<<<<<<< (major, minor, update, alpha1)
        24: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 <<<<<<<<< (_, _, _, alpha2)
    
        28: 0x6d 0x6c 0x78 0x30
        32: 0x2e 0x31 0x00 0x00
        36: 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00
        40: 0x16 0x1d 0x07 0xd2
        44: 0x10 0x1d 0x15 0xb3
        48: 0x00 0x17 0x15 0xb3
        52: 0x00 0x00 0x81 0x19
    
    This should be parsed as "1.1.0".
    
    "f" in the upper-nibble means to ignore it, contributing zero.
    
    If both nibbles are "f", I think the whole field is supposed to be ignored.
    Major and minor are "required", meaning they're not supposed to be "ff",
    but the update field is "optional" so I think it can be ff. I think the
    simplest thing to do is just set the major and minor to zero instead of
    juggling some conditional logic or something.
    
    bcd2bin() from "include/linux/bcd.h" seems to assume both nibbles are 0-9,
    so I've provided a custom BCD decoding function.
    
    Alpha1 and alpha2 are ISO/IEC 8859-1 encoded, which just means ASCII
    characters as far as I can tell, although the full encoding table for
    non-alphabetic characters is slightly different (I think).
    
    I imagine the alpha fields are just supposed to be alphabetic characters,
    but I haven't seen any network cards actually report a non-zero value for
    either.
    
    If people wrote software against this netlink behavior, and were parsing
    the major and minor versions themselves from the u32, then this would
    definitely break their code.

    wifi: ath11k: Defer on rproc_get failure
    
    [ Upstream commit 2a3ec40b98b46c339adb57313d3b933ee5e7a8e8 ]
    
    If we already have gotten the rproc_handle (meaning the "qcom,rproc"
    property is defined in the devicetree), it's a valid state that the
    remoteproc module hasn't probed yet so we should defer probing instead
    of just failing to probe.
    
    This resolves a race condition when the ath11k driver probes and fails
    before the wpss remoteproc driver has probed, like the following:
    
      [    6.232360] ath11k 17a10040.wifi: failed to get rproc
      [    6.232366] ath11k 17a10040.wifi: failed to get rproc: -22
      [    6.232478] ath11k: probe of 17a10040.wifi failed with error -22
           ...
      [    6.252415] remoteproc remoteproc2: 8a00000.remoteproc is available
      [    6.252776] remoteproc remoteproc2: powering up 8a00000.remoteproc
      [    6.252781] remoteproc remoteproc2: Booting fw image qcom/qcm6490/fairphone5/wpss.mdt, size 7188
    
    So, defer the probe if we hit that so we can retry later once the wpss
    remoteproc is available.

    bpf: Add crosstask check to __bpf_get_stack
    
    [ Upstream commit b8e3a87a627b575896e448021e5c2f8a3bc19931 ]
    
    Currently get_perf_callchain only supports user stack walking for
    the current task. Passing the correct *crosstask* param will return
    0 frames if the task passed to __bpf_get_stack isn't the current
    one instead of a single incorrect frame/address. This change
    passes the correct *crosstask* param but also does a preemptive
    check in __bpf_get_stack if the task is current and returns
    -EOPNOTSUPP if it is not.
    
    This issue was found using bpf_get_task_stack inside a BPF
    iterator ("iter/task"), which iterates over all tasks.
    bpf_get_task_stack works fine for fetching kernel stacks
    but because get_perf_callchain relies on the caller to know
    if the requested *task* is the current one (via *crosstask*)
    it was failing in a confusing way.
    
    It might be possible to get user stacks for all tasks utilizing
    something like access_process_vm but that requires the bpf
    program calling bpf_get_task_stack to be sleepable and would
    therefore be a breaking change.

    When testing sahara sha256 speed performance with tcrypt (mode=404) on

    Now that the previous commit fixed sahara_sha_hw_links_create() to take
    into account the actual request size, rather than relying on sg->length
    values, the resize operation is no longer necessary.

    gfs2: Also reflect single-block allocations in rgd->rd_extfail_pt
    
    [ Upstream commit f38e998fbbb5da6a097ecd4b2700ba95eabab0c9 ]
    
    Pass a non-NULL minext to gfs2_rbm_find even for single-block allocations.  In
    gfs2_rbm_find, also set rgd->rd_extfail_pt when a single-block allocation
    fails in a resource group: there is no reason for treating that case
    differently.  In gfs2_reservation_check_and_update, only check how many free
    blocks we have if more than one block is requested; we already know there's at
    least one free block.
    
    In addition, when allocating N blocks fails in gfs2_rbm_find, we need to set
    rd_extfail_pt to N - 1 rather than N:  rd_extfail_pt defines the biggest
    allocation that might still succeed.
    
    Finally, reset rd_extfail_pt when updating the resource group statistics in
    update_rgrp_lvb, as we already do in gfs2_rgrp_bh_get.

    been scanning from the beginning of the bitmap until the end and we haven't
    found a single free block, and we're not skipping reservations in that process,
    either.  This means that in gfs2_rbm_find, we can always skip bitmaps with the

    pstore: ram_core: fix possible overflow in persistent_ram_init_ecc()
    
    [ Upstream commit 86222a8fc16ec517de8da2604d904c9df3a08e5d ]
    
    In persistent_ram_init_ecc(), on 64-bit arches DIV_ROUND_UP() will return
    64-bit value since persistent_ram_zone::buffer_size has type size_t which
    is derived from the 64-bit *unsigned long*, while the ecc_blocks variable
    this value gets assigned to has (always 32-bit) *int* type.  Even if that
    value fits into *int* type, an overflow is still possible when calculating
    the size_t typed ecc_total variable further below since there's no cast to
    any 64-bit type before multiplication.  Declaring the ecc_blocks variable
    as *size_t* should fix this mess...
    
    Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE static
    analysis tool.

    Remove the FLAGS_NEW_KEY logic as it has the following issues:
    - the wrong key may end up being used when there are multiple data streams:

        setkey()
        encrypt()

        encrypt() <--- key from t2 is used
    - switching between encryption and decryption with the same key is not
      possible, as the hdr flags are only updated when a new setkey() is
      performed
    
    With this change, the key is always sent along with the cryptdata when
    performing encryption/decryption operations.

    There are two problems:
    1, The queue depth is always 1, the performance of a virtio crypto
       device gets limited. Multi user processes share a single control
       queue, and hit spin lock race from control queue. Test on Intel
       Platinum 8260, a single worker gets ~35K/s create/close session
       operations, and 8 workers get ~40K/s operations with 800% CPU
       utilization.
    2, The control request is supposed to get handled immediately, but
       in the current implementation of QEMU(v6.2), the vCPU thread kicks
       another thread to do this work, the latency also gets unstable.
       Tracking latency of virtio_crypto_alg_akcipher_close_session in 5s:

    This means that a CPU may hold vcrypto->ctrl_lock as long as 8192~16383us.
    
    To improve the performance of control queue, a request on control queue
    waits completion instead of busy polling to reduce lock racing, and gets
    completed by control queue callback.

    virtio-crypto: use private buffer for control request
    
    [ Upstream commit 0756ad15b1fef287d4d8fa11bc36ea77a5c42e4a ]
    
    Originally, all of the control requests share a single buffer(
    ctrl & input & ctrl_status fields in struct virtio_crypto), this
    allows queue depth 1 only, the performance of control queue gets
    limited by this design.
    
    In this patch, each request allocates request buffer dynamically, and
    free buffer after request, so the scope protected by ctrl_lock also
    get optimized here.
    It's possible to optimize control queue depth in the next step.
    
    A necessary comment is already in code, still describe it again:
    /*
     * Note: there are padding fields in request, clear them to zero before
     * sending to host to avoid to divulge any information.
     * Ex, virtio_crypto_ctrl_request::ctrl::u::destroy_session::padding[48]
     */
    So use kzalloc to allocate buffer of struct virtio_crypto_ctrl_request.

    virtio-crypto: change code style

    Use temporary variable to make code easy to read and maintain.
            /* Pad cipher's parameters */
            vcrypto->ctrl.u.sym_create_session.op_type =
                    cpu_to_le32(VIRTIO_CRYPTO_SYM_OP_CIPHER);
            vcrypto->ctrl.u.sym_create_session.u.cipher.para.algo =
                    vcrypto->ctrl.header.algo;
            vcrypto->ctrl.u.sym_create_session.u.cipher.para.keylen =
                    cpu_to_le32(keylen);
            vcrypto->ctrl.u.sym_create_session.u.cipher.para.op =
                    cpu_to_le32(op);
    -->
            sym_create_session = &ctrl->u.sym_create_session;
            sym_create_session->op_type = cpu_to_le32(VIRTIO_CRYPTO_SYM_OP_CIPHER);
            sym_create_session->u.cipher.para.algo = ctrl->header.algo;
            sym_create_session->u.cipher.para.keylen = cpu_to_le32(keylen);
            sym_create_session->u.cipher.para.op = cpu_to_le32(op);
    
    The new style shows more obviously:
    - the variable we want to operate.
    - an assignment statement in a single line.

    mtd: Fix gluebi NULL pointer dereference caused by ftl notifier
    
    [ Upstream commit a43bdc376deab5fff1ceb93dca55bcab8dbdc1d6 ]
    
    If both ftl.ko and gluebi.ko are loaded, the notifier of ftl
    triggers NULL pointer dereference when trying to access
    ‘gluebi->desc’ in gluebi_read().

    Detailed reproduction information available at the Link [1],
    
    In the normal case, obtain gluebi->desc in the gluebi_get_device(),
    and access gluebi->desc in the gluebi_read(). However,
    gluebi_get_device() is not executed in advance in the
    ftl_add_mtd() process, which leads to NULL pointer dereference.
    
    The solution for the gluebi module is to run jffs2 on the UBI
    volume without considering working with ftl or mtdblock [2].
    Therefore, this problem can be avoided by preventing gluebi from
    creating the mtdblock device after creating mtd partition of the
    type MTD_UBIVOLUME.

    errors. This may prevent logging of subsequent uncorrected errors.
    
    Fix by clearing the status.

    efivarfs: force RO when remounting if SetVariable is not supported
    
    [ Upstream commit 0e8d2444168dd519fea501599d150e62718ed2fe ]
    
    If SetVariable at runtime is not supported by the firmware we never assign
    a callback for that function. At the same time mount the efivarfs as
    RO so no one can call that.  However, we never check the permission flags
    when someone remounts the filesystem as RW. As a result this leads to a
    crash looking like this:
    
    $ mount -o remount,rw /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
    $ efi-updatevar -f PK.auth PK

    calipso: fix memory leak in netlbl_calipso_add_pass()
    
    [ Upstream commit ec4e9d630a64df500641892f4e259e8149594a99 ]
    
    If IPv6 support is disabled at boot (ipv6.disable=1),
    the calipso_init() -> netlbl_calipso_ops_register() function isn't called,
    and the netlbl_calipso_ops_get() function always returns NULL.
    In this case, the netlbl_calipso_add_pass() function allocates memory
    for the doi_def variable but doesn't free it with the calipso_doi_free().

    powerpc/pseries/memhp: Fix access beyond end of drmem array
    
    [ Upstream commit bd68ffce69f6cf8ddd3a3c32549d1d2275e49fc5 ]
    
    dlpar_memory_remove_by_index() may access beyond the bounds of the
    drmem lmb array when the LMB lookup fails to match an entry with the
    given DRC index. When the search fails, the cursor is left pointing to
    &drmem_info->lmbs[drmem_info->n_lmbs], which is one element past the
    last valid entry in the array. The debug message at the end of the
    function then dereferences this pointer:

                     lmb->base_addr);

    powerpc/pseries/memhotplug: Quieten some DLPAR operations
    
    [ Upstream commit 20e9de85edae3a5866f29b6cce87c9ec66d62a1b ]
    
    When attempting to remove by index a set of LMBs a lot of messages are
    displayed on the console, even when everything goes fine:
    
      pseries-hotplug-mem: Attempting to hot-remove LMB, drc index 8000002d
      Offlined Pages 4096
      pseries-hotplug-mem: Memory at 2d0000000 was hot-removed
    
    The 2 messages prefixed by "pseries-hotplug-mem" are not really
    helpful for the end user, they should be debug outputs.
    
    In case of error, because some of the LMB's pages couldn't be
    offlined, the following is displayed on the console:
    
      pseries-hotplug-mem: Attempting to hot-remove LMB, drc index 8000003e
      pseries-hotplug-mem: Failed to hot-remove memory at 3e0000000
      dlpar: Could not handle DLPAR request "memory remove index 0x8000003e"
    
    Again, the 2 messages prefixed by "pseries-hotplug-mem" are useless,
    and the generic DLPAR prefixed message should be enough.
    
    These 2 first changes are mainly triggered by the changes introduced
    in drmgr:
      https://groups.google.com/g/powerpc-utils-devel/c/Y6ef4NB3EzM/m/9cu5JHRxAQAJ
    
    Also, when adding a bunch of LMBs, a message is displayed in the console per LMB
    like these ones:
      pseries-hotplug-mem: Memory at 7e0000000 (drc index 8000007e) was hot-added
      pseries-hotplug-mem: Memory at 7f0000000 (drc index 8000007f) was hot-added
      pseries-hotplug-mem: Memory at 800000000 (drc index 80000080) was hot-added
      pseries-hotplug-mem: Memory at 810000000 (drc index 80000081) was hot-added
    
    When adding 1TB of memory and LMB size is 256MB, this leads to 4096
    messages to be displayed on the console. These messages are not really
    helpful for the end user, so moving them to the DEBUG level.

       ...
    
    Apparently the author of this driver expected strncat() to behave the
    way that strlcat() does, which uses the size of the destination buffer
    as its third argument rather than the length of the source buffer. The
    result is that there is no check on the size of the allocated buffer.
    
    Change it to strlcat().

    x86/lib: Fix overflow when counting digits
    
    [ Upstream commit a24d61c609813963aacc9f6ec8343f4fcaac7243 ]
    
    tl;dr: The num_digits() function has a theoretical overflow issue.
    But it doesn't affect any actual in-tree users.  Fix it by using
    a larger type for one of the local variables.
    
    Long version:
    
    There is an overflow in variable m in function num_digits when val
    is >= 1410065408 which leads to the digit calculation loop to
    iterate more times than required. This results in either more
    digits being counted or in some cases (for example where val is
    1932683193) the value of m eventually overflows to zero and the
    while loop spins forever).
    
    Currently the function num_digits is currently only being used for
    small values of val in the SMP boot stage for digit counting on the
    number of cpus and NUMA nodes, so the overflow is never encountered.
    However it is useful to fix the overflow issue in case the function
    is used for other purposes in the future. (The issue was discovered
    while investigating the digit counting performance in various
    kernel helper functions rather than any real-world use-case).
    
    The simplest fix is to make m a long long, the overhead in
    multiplication speed for a long long is very minor for small values
    of val less than 10000 on modern processors. The alternative
    fix is to replace the multiplication with a constant division
    by 10 loop (this compiles down to an multiplication and shift)
    without needing to make m a long long, but this is slightly slower
    than the fix in this commit when measured on a range of x86
    processors).

    coresight: etm4x: Fix width of CCITMIN field
    
    commit cc0271a339cc70cae914c3ec20edc2a8058407da upstream.
    
    CCITMIN is a 12 bit field and doesn't fit in a u8, so extend it to u16.
    This probably wasn't an issue previously because values higher than 255
    never occurred.
    
    But since commit 4aff040bcc8d ("coresight: etm: Override TRCIDR3.CCITMIN
    on errata affected cpus"), a comparison with 256 was done to enable the
    errata, generating the following W=1 build error:
    
      coresight-etm4x-core.c:1188:24: error: result of comparison of
      constant 256 with expression of type 'u8' (aka 'unsigned char') is
      always false [-Werror,-Wtautological-constant-out-of-range-compare]
    
       if (drvdata->ccitmin == 256)

    uio: Fix use-after-free in uio_open
    
    commit 0c9ae0b8605078eafc3bea053cc78791e97ba2e2 upstream.
    
    core-1                          core-2
    -------------------------------------------------------
    uio_unregister_device           uio_open
                                    idev = idr_find()
    device_unregister(&idev->dev)
    put_device(&idev->dev)
    uio_device_release
                                    get_device(&idev->dev)
    kfree(idev)
    uio_free_minor(minor)
                                    uio_release
                                    put_device(&idev->dev)
                                    kfree(idev)
    -------------------------------------------------------
    
    In the core-1 uio_unregister_device(), the device_unregister will kfree
    idev when the idev->dev kobject ref is 1. But after core-1
    device_unregister, put_device and before doing kfree, the core-2 may
    get_device. Then:
    1. After core-1 kfree idev, the core-2 will do use-after-free for idev.
    2. When core-2 do uio_release and put_device, the idev will be double
       freed.
    
    To address this issue, we can get idev atomic & inc idev reference with
    minor_lock.

    net: qrtr: ns: Return 0 if server port is not present
    
    [ Upstream commit 9bf2e9165f90dc9f416af53c902be7e33930f728 ]
    
    When a 'DEL_CLIENT' message is received from the remote, the corresponding
    server port gets deleted. A DEL_SERVER message is then announced for this
    server. As part of handling the subsequent DEL_SERVER message, the name-
    server attempts to delete the server port which results in a '-ENOENT' error.
    The return value from server_del() is then propagated back to qrtr_ns_worker,
    causing excessive error prints.
    To address this, return 0 from control_cmd_del_server() without checking the
    return value of server_del(), since the above scenario is not an error case
    and hence server_del() doesn't have any other error return value.

    The IDA usually detects double-frees, but that detection failed to
    consider the case when there are no nearby IDs allocated and so we have a
    NULL bitmap rather than simply having a clear bit.  Add some tests to the
    test-suite to be sure we don't inadvertently reintroduce this problem.
    Unfortunately they're quite noisy so include a message to disregard

    sleep, if the user presses a keyboard key while the screen is still black,
    the mouse and keyboard become unusable.
    
    Enabling this quirk prevents this behavior from occurring.

    Input: atkbd - skip ATKBD_CMD_GETID in translated mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 936e4d49ecbc8c404790504386e1422b599dec39 ]
    
    There have been multiple reports of keyboard issues on recent laptop models
    which can be worked around by setting i8042.dumbkbd, with the downside
    being this breaks the capslock LED.
    
    It seems that these issues are caused by recent laptops getting confused by
    ATKBD_CMD_GETID. Rather then adding and endless growing list of quirks for
    this, just skip ATKBD_CMD_GETID alltogether on laptops in translated mode.
    
    The main goal of sending ATKBD_CMD_GETID is to skip binding to ps/2
    mice/touchpads and those are never used in translated mode.
    
    Examples of laptop models which benefit from skipping ATKBD_CMD_GETID:
    
    * "HP Laptop 15s-fq2xxx", "HP laptop 15s-fq4xxx" and "HP Laptop 15-dy2xxx"
      models the kbd stops working for the first 2 - 5 minutes after boot
      (waiting for EC watchdog reset?)
    
    * On "HP Spectre x360 13-aw2xxx" atkbd fails to probe the keyboard
    
    * At least 9 different Lenovo models have issues with ATKBD_CMD_GETID, see:
      https://github.com/yescallop/atkbd-nogetid
    
    This has been tested on:
    
    1. A MSI B550M PRO-VDH WIFI desktop, where the i8042 controller is not
       in translated mode when no keyboard is plugged in and with a ps/2 kbd
       a "AT Translated Set 2 keyboard" /dev/input/event# node shows up
    
    2. A Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga gen 8 (always has a translated set 2 keyboard)

    tracing: Add size check when printing trace_marker output
    
    [ Upstream commit 60be76eeabb3d83858cc6577fc65c7d0f36ffd42 ]
    
    If for some reason the trace_marker write does not have a nul byte for the
    string, it will overflow the print:
    
      trace_seq_printf(s, ": %s", field->buf);
    
    The field->buf could be missing the nul byte. To prevent overflow, add the
    max size that the buf can be by using the event size and the field
    location.
    
      int max = iter->ent_size - offsetof(struct print_entry, buf);
    
      trace_seq_printf(s, ": %*.s", max, field->buf);

    Analyzed informations from vmcore as follows:
    (1) There are about 5k+ jbd2_inode in 'commit_transaction->t_inode_list';
    (2) Now is processing the 855th jbd2_inode;
    (3) JBD2 task has TIF_NEED_RESCHED flag;
    (4) There's no pags in address_space around the 855th jbd2_inode;
    (5) There are some process is doing drop caches;
    (6) Mounted with 'nodioread_nolock' option;
    (7) 128 CPUs;
    
    According to informations from vmcore we know 'journal->j_list_lock' spin lock
    competition is fierce. So journal_finish_inode_data_buffers() maybe process
    slowly. Theoretically, there is scheduling point in the filemap_fdatawait_range_keep_errors().
    However, if inode's address_space has no pages which taged with PAGECACHE_TAG_WRITEBACK,
    will not call cond_resched(). So may lead to soft lockup.
    journal_finish_inode_data_buffers
      filemap_fdatawait_range_keep_errors
        __filemap_fdatawait_range
          while (index <= end)
            nr_pages = pagevec_lookup_range_tag(&pvec, mapping, &index, end, PAGECACHE_TAG_WRITEBACK);
            if (!nr_pages)
               break;    --> If 'nr_pages' is equal zero will break, then will not call cond_resched()
            for (i = 0; i < nr_pages; i++)
              wait_on_page_writeback(page);
            cond_resched();
    
    To solve above issue, add scheduling point in the journal_finish_inode_data_buffers();

    neighbour: Don't let neigh_forced_gc() disable preemption for long
    
    [ Upstream commit e5dc5afff62f3e97e86c3643ec9fcad23de4f2d3 ]
    
    We are seeing cases where neigh_cleanup_and_release() is called by
    neigh_forced_gc() many times in a row with preemption turned off.
    When running on a low powered CPU at a low CPU frequency, this has
    been measured to keep preemption off for ~10 ms. That's not great on a
    system with HZ=1000 which expects tasks to be able to schedule in
    with ~1ms latency.

    drm/crtc: Fix uninit-value bug in drm_mode_setcrtc
    
    [ Upstream commit 3823119b9c2b5f9e9b760336f75bc989b805cde6 ]
    
    The connector_set contains uninitialized values when allocated with
    kmalloc_array. However, in the "out" branch, the logic assumes that any
    element in connector_set would be equal to NULL if failed to
    initialize, which causes the bug reported by Syzbot. The fix is to use
    an extra variable to keep track of how many connectors are initialized
    indeed, and use that variable to decrease any refcounts in the "out"
    branch.

    [ Upstream commit 8d1b7809684c688005706125b804e1f9792d2b1b ]
    
    Fix a wrong error checking in exynos_drm_dma.c module.
    
    In the exynos_drm_register_dma function, both arm_iommu_create_mapping()
    and iommu_get_domain_for_dev() functions are expected to return NULL as
    an error.
    
    However, the error checking is performed using the statement
    if(IS_ERR(mapping)), which doesn't provide a suitable error value.
    So check if 'mapping' is NULL, and if it is, return -ENODEV.
    
    This issue[1] was reported by Dan.

    nvme: introduce helper function to get ctrl state
    
    [ Upstream commit 5c687c287c46fadb14644091823298875a5216aa ]
    
    The controller state is typically written by another CPU, so reading it
    should ensure no optimizations are taken. This is a repeated pattern in
    the driver, so start with adding a convenience function that returns the
    controller state with READ_ONCE().

    net/tg3: fix race condition in tg3_reset_task()
    
    [ Upstream commit 16b55b1f2269962fb6b5154b8bf43f37c9a96637 ]
    
    When an EEH error is encountered by a PCI adapter, the EEH driver
    modifies the PCI channel's state as shown below:
    
       enum {
          /* I/O channel is in normal state */
          pci_channel_io_normal = (__force pci_channel_state_t) 1,
    
          /* I/O to channel is blocked */
          pci_channel_io_frozen = (__force pci_channel_state_t) 2,
    
          /* PCI card is dead */
          pci_channel_io_perm_failure = (__force pci_channel_state_t) 3,
       };
    
    If the same EEH error then causes the tg3 driver's transmit timeout
    logic to execute, the tg3_tx_timeout() function schedules a reset
    task via tg3_reset_task_schedule(), which may cause a race condition
    between the tg3 and EEH driver as both attempt to recover the HW via
    a reset action.
    
    EEH driver gets error event
    --> eeh_set_channel_state()
        and set device to one of
        error state above           scheduler: tg3_reset_task() get
                                    returned error from tg3_init_hw()
                                 --> dev_close() shuts down the interface
    tg3_io_slot_reset() and
    tg3_io_resume() fail to
    reset/resume the device
    
    To resolve this issue, we avoid the race condition by checking the PCI
    channel state in the tg3_reset_task() function and skip the tg3 driver
    initiated reset when the PCI channel is not in the normal state.  (The
    driver has no access to tg3 device registers at this point and cannot
    even complete the reset task successfully without external assistance.)
    We'll leave the reset procedure to be managed by the EEH driver which
    calls the tg3_io_error_detected(), tg3_io_slot_reset() and
    tg3_io_resume() functions as appropriate.
    
    Adding the same checking in tg3_dump_state() to avoid dumping all
    device registers when the PCI channel is not in the normal state.

    debugfs: fix automount d_fsdata usage
    
    [ Upstream commit 0ed04a1847a10297595ac24dc7d46b35fb35f90a ]
    
    debugfs_create_automount() stores a function pointer in d_fsdata,
    but since commit 7c8d469877b1 ("debugfs: add support for more
    elaborate ->d_fsdata") debugfs_release_dentry() will free it, now
    conditionally on DEBUGFS_FSDATA_IS_REAL_FOPS_BIT, but that's not
    set for the function pointer in automount. As a result, removing
    an automount dentry would attempt to free the function pointer.
    Luckily, the only user of this (tracing) never removes it.
    
    Nevertheless, it's safer if we just handle the fsdata in one way,
    namely either DEBUGFS_FSDATA_IS_REAL_FOPS_BIT or allocated. Thus,
    change the automount to allocate it, and use the real_fops in the
    data to indicate whether or not automount is filled, rather than
    adding a type tag. At least for now this isn't actually needed,
    but the next changes will require it.
    
    Also check in debugfs_file_get() that it gets only called
    on regular files, just to make things clearer.
