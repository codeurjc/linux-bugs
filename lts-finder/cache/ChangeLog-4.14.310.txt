    x86/cpu: Fix LFENCE serialization check in init_amd()
    
    The commit: 3f235279828c ("x86/cpu: Restore AMD's DE_CFG MSR after resume")
    which was backported from the upstream commit: 2632daebafd0 renamed the
    MSR_F10H_DECFG_LFENCE_SERIALIZE macro to MSR_AMD64_DE_CFG_LFENCE_SERIALIZE.
    The fix for 4.14 and 4.9 changed MSR_F10H_DECFG_LFENCE_SERIALIZE to
    MSR_AMD64_DE_CFG_LFENCE_SERIALIZE_BIT in the init_amd() function, but should
    have used MSR_AMD64_DE_CFG_LFENCE_SERIALIZE.  This causes a discrepency in the
    LFENCE serialization check in the init_amd() function.
    
    This causes a ~16% sysbench memory regression, when running:
        sysbench --test=memory run

    drm/i915: Don't use BAR mappings for ring buffers with LLC
    
    commit 85636167e3206c3fbd52254fc432991cc4e90194 upstream.
    
    Direction from hardware is that ring buffers should never be mapped
    via the BAR on systems with LLC. There are too many caching pitfalls
    due to the way BAR accesses are routed. So it is safest to just not
    use it.

    media: ov5640: Fix analogue gain control
    
    [ Upstream commit afa4805799c1d332980ad23339fdb07b5e0cf7e0 ]
    
    Gain control is badly documented in publicly available (including
    leaked) documentation.
    
    There is an AGC pre-gain in register 0x3a13, expressed as a 6-bit value
    (plus an enable bit in bit 6). The driver hardcodes it to 0x43, which
    one application note states is equal to x1.047. The documentation also
    states that 0x40 is equel to x1.000. The pre-gain thus seems to be
    expressed as in 1/64 increments, and thus ranges from x1.00 to x1.984.
    What the pre-gain does is however unspecified.
    
    There is then an AGC gain limit, in registers 0x3a18 and 0x3a19,
    expressed as a 10-bit "real gain format" value. One application note
    sets it to 0x00f8 and states it is equal to x15.5, so it appears to be
    expressed in 1/16 increments, up to x63.9375.
    
    The manual gain is stored in registers 0x350a and 0x350b, also as a
    10-bit "real gain format" value. It is documented in the application
    note as a Q6.4 values, up to x63.9375.
    
    One version of the datasheet indicates that the sensor supports a
    digital gain:
    
      The OV5640 supports 1/2/4 digital gain. Normally, the gain is
      controlled automatically by the automatic gain control (AGC) block.
    
    It isn't clear how that would be controlled manually.
    
    There appears to be no indication regarding whether the gain controlled
    through registers 0x350a and 0x350b is an analogue gain only or also
    includes digital gain. The words "real gain" don't necessarily mean
    "combined analogue and digital gains". Some OmniVision sensors (such as
    the OV8858) are documented as supoprting different formats for the gain
    values, selectable through a register bit, and they are called "real
    gain format" and "sensor gain format". For that sensor, we have (one of)
    the gain registers documented as
    
      0x3503[2]=0, gain[7:0] is real gain format, where low 4 bits are
      fraction bits, for example, 0x10 is 1x gain, 0x28 is 2.5x gain
    
      If 0x3503[2]=1, gain[7:0] is sensor gain format, gain[7:4] is coarse
      gain, 00000: 1x, 00001: 2x, 00011: 4x, 00111: 8x, gain[7] is 1,
      gain[3:0] is fine gain. For example, 0x10 is 1x gain, 0x30 is 2x gain,
      0x70 is 4x gain
    
    (The second part of the text makes little sense)
    
    "Real gain" may thus refer to the combination of the coarse and fine
    analogue gains as a single value.
    
    The OV5640 0x350a and 0x350b registers thus appear to control analogue
    gain. The driver incorrectly uses V4L2_CID_GAIN as V4L2 has a specific
    control for analogue gain, V4L2_CID_ANALOGUE_GAIN. Use it.
    
    If registers 0x350a and 0x350b are later found to control digital gain
    as well, the driver could then restrict the range of the analogue gain
    control value to lower than x64 and add a separate digital gain control.

    alpha: fix R_ALPHA_LITERAL reloc for large modules
    
    [ Upstream commit b6b17a8b3ecd878d98d5472a9023ede9e669ca72 ]
    
    Previously, R_ALPHA_LITERAL relocations would overflow for large kernel
    modules.
    
    This was because the Alpha's apply_relocate_add was relying on the kernel's
    module loader to have sorted the GOT towards the very end of the module as it
    was mapped into memory in order to correctly assign the global pointer. While
    this behavior would mostly work fine for small kernel modules, this approach
    would overflow on kernel modules with large GOT's since the global pointer
    would be very far away from the GOT, and thus, certain entries would be out of
    range.
    
    This patch fixes this by instead using the Tru64 behavior of assigning the
    global pointer to be 32KB away from the start of the GOT. The change made
    in this patch won't work for multi-GOT kernel modules as it makes the
    assumption the module only has one GOT located at the beginning of .got,
    although for the vast majority kernel modules, this should be fine. Of the
    kernel modules that would previously result in a relocation error, none of
    them, even modules like nouveau, have even come close to filling up a single
    GOT, and they've all worked fine under this patch.

    Later on, devices in the todo list are processed by netdev_run_todo().

    ext4: zero i_disksize when initializing the bootloader inode
    
    commit f5361da1e60d54ec81346aee8e3d8baf1be0b762 upstream.
    
    If the boot loader inode has never been used before, the
    EXT4_IOC_SWAP_BOOT inode will initialize it, including setting the
    i_size to 0.  However, if the "never before used" boot loader has a
    non-zero i_size, then i_disksize will be non-zero, and the
    inconsistency between i_size and i_disksize can trigger a kernel
    warning:

    Reproducer:
     1. create corrupted image and mount it:
           mke2fs -t ext4 /tmp/foo.img 200
           debugfs -wR "sif <5> size 25700" /tmp/foo.img
           mount -t ext4 /tmp/foo.img /mnt
           cd /mnt
           echo 123 > file
     2. Run the reproducer program:
           posix_memalign(&buf, 1024, 1024)
           fd = open("file", O_RDWR | O_DIRECT);
           ioctl(fd, EXT4_IOC_SWAP_BOOT);
           write(fd, buf, 1024);
    
    Fix this by setting i_disksize as well as i_size to zero when
    initiaizing the boot loader inode.

          -> len is unsigned int, maybe very large, then trigger warning when

    To resolve the above issue we need to update 'i_inline_off' after
    'ext4_xattr_shift_entries()'.  We do not need to set
    EXT4_STATE_MAY_INLINE_DATA flag here, since ext4_mark_inode_dirty()
    already sets this flag if needed.  Setting EXT4_STATE_MAY_INLINE_DATA
    when it is needed may trigger a BUG_ON in ext4_writepages().

    ext4: move where set the MAY_INLINE_DATA flag is set
    
    commit 1dcdce5919115a471bf4921a57f20050c545a236 upstream.
    
    The only caller of ext4_find_inline_data_nolock() that needs setting of
    EXT4_STATE_MAY_INLINE_DATA flag is ext4_iget_extra_inode().  In
    ext4_write_inline_data_end() we just need to update inode->i_inline_off.
    Since we are going to add one more caller that does not need to set
    EXT4_STATE_MAY_INLINE_DATA, just move setting of EXT4_STATE_MAY_INLINE_DATA
    out to ext4_iget_extra_inode().

    ext4: fix another off-by-one fsmap error on 1k block filesystems
    
    commit c993799baf9c5861f8df91beb80e1611b12efcbd upstream.
    
    Apparently syzbot figured out that issuing this FSMAP call:
    
    struct fsmap_head cmd = {
            .fmh_count      = ...;
            .fmh_keys       = {
                    { .fmr_device = /* ext4 dev */, .fmr_physical = 0, },
                    { .fmr_device = /* ext4 dev */, .fmr_physical = 0, },
            },
    ...
    };
    ret = ioctl(fd, FS_IOC_GETFSMAP, &cmd);
    
    Produces this crash if the underlying filesystem is a 1k-block ext4
    filesystem:

    For GETFSMAP calls, the caller selects a physical block device by
    writing its block number into fsmap_head.fmh_keys[01].fmr_device.
    To query mappings for a subrange of the device, the starting byte of the
    range is written to fsmap_head.fmh_keys[0].fmr_physical and the last
    byte of the range goes in fsmap_head.fmh_keys[1].fmr_physical.
    
    IOWs, to query what mappings overlap with bytes 3-14 of /dev/sda, you'd
    set the inputs as follows:
    
            fmh_keys[0] = { .fmr_device = major(8, 0), .fmr_physical = 3},
            fmh_keys[1] = { .fmr_device = major(8, 0), .fmr_physical = 14},
    
    Which would return you whatever is mapped in the 12 bytes starting at
    physical offset 3.
    
    The crash is due to insufficient range validation of keys[1] in
    ext4_getfsmap_datadev.  On 1k-block filesystems, block 0 is not part of
    the filesystem, which means that s_first_data_block is nonzero.
    ext4_get_group_no_and_offset subtracts this quantity from the blocknr
    argument before cracking it into a group number and a block number
    within a group.  IOWs, block group 0 spans blocks 1-8192 (1-based)
    instead of 0-8191 (0-based) like what happens with larger blocksizes.
    
    The net result of this encoding is that blocknr < s_first_data_block is
    not a valid input to this function.  The end_fsb variable is set from
    the keys that are copied from userspace, which means that in the above
    example, its value is zero.  That leads to an underflow here:
    
            blocknr = blocknr - le32_to_cpu(es->s_first_data_block);
    
    The division then operates on -1:
    
            offset = do_div(blocknr, EXT4_BLOCKS_PER_GROUP(sb)) >>
                    EXT4_SB(sb)->s_cluster_bits;
    
    Leaving an impossibly large group number (2^32-1) in blocknr.
    ext4_getfsmap_check_keys checked that keys[0].fmr_physical and
    keys[1].fmr_physical are in increasing order, but
    ext4_getfsmap_datadev adjusts keys[0].fmr_physical to be at least
    s_first_data_block.  This implies that we have to check it again after
    the adjustment, which is the piece that I forgot.

    ext4: fix RENAME_WHITEOUT handling for inline directories
    
    commit c9f62c8b2dbf7240536c0cc9a4529397bb8bf38e upstream.
    
    A significant number of xfstests can cause ext4 to log one or more
    warning messages when they are run on a test file system where the
    inline_data feature has been enabled.  An example:
    
    "EXT4-fs warning (device vdc): ext4_dirblock_csum_set:425: inode
     #16385: comm fsstress: No space for directory leaf checksum. Please
    run e2fsck -D."
    
    The xfstests include: ext4/057, 058, and 307; generic/013, 051, 068,
    070, 076, 078, 083, 232, 269, 270, 390, 461, 475, 476, 482, 579, 585,
    589, 626, 631, and 650.
    
    In this situation, the warning message indicates a bug in the code that
    performs the RENAME_WHITEOUT operation on a directory entry that has
    been stored inline.  It doesn't detect that the directory is stored
    inline, and incorrectly attempts to compute a dirent block checksum on
    the whiteout inode when creating it.  This attempt fails as a result
    of the integrity checking in get_dirent_tail (usually due to a failure
    to match the EXT4_FT_DIR_CSUM magic cookie), and the warning message
    is then emitted.
    
    Fix this by simply collecting the inlined data state at the time the
    search for the source directory entry is performed.  Existing code
    handles the rest, and this is sufficient to eliminate all spurious
    warning messages produced by the tests above.  Go one step further
    and do the same in the code that resets the source directory entry in
    the event of failure.  The inlined state should be present in the
    "old" struct, but given the possibility of a race there's no harm
    in taking a conservative approach and getting that information again
    since the directory entry is being reread anyway.

    x86/CPU/AMD: Disable XSAVES on AMD family 0x17
    
    commit b0563468eeac88ebc70559d52a0b66efc37e4e9d upstream.
    
    AMD Erratum 1386 is summarised as:
    
      XSAVES Instruction May Fail to Save XMM Registers to the Provided
      State Save Area
    
    This piece of accidental chronomancy causes the %xmm registers to
    occasionally reset back to an older value.
    
    Ignore the XSAVES feature on all AMD Zen1/2 hardware.  The XSAVEC
    instruction (which works fine) is equivalent on affected parts.
