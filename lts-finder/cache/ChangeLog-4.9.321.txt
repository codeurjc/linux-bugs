    swiotlb: skip swiotlb_bounce when orig_addr is zero
    
    After patch ddbd89deb7d3 ("swiotlb: fix info leak with DMA_FROM_DEVICE"),
    swiotlb_bounce will be called in swiotlb_tbl_map_single unconditionally.
    This requires that the physical address must be valid, which is not always
    true on stable-4.19 or earlier version.
    On stable-4.19, swiotlb_alloc_buffer will call swiotlb_tbl_map_single with
    orig_addr equal to zero, which cause such a panic:
    
    Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffffb77a40000000
    ...
    pc : __memcpy+0x100/0x180
    lr : swiotlb_bounce+0x74/0x88
    ...
    Call trace:
     __memcpy+0x100/0x180
     swiotlb_tbl_map_single+0x2c8/0x338
     swiotlb_alloc+0xb4/0x198
     __dma_alloc+0x84/0x1d8
     ...
    
    On stable-4.9 and stable-4.14, swiotlb_alloc_coherent wille call map_single
    with orig_addr equal to zero, which can cause same panic.
    
    Fix this by skipping swiotlb_bounce when orig_addr is zero.

    kexec_file: drop weak attribute from arch_kexec_apply_relocations[_add]
    
    commit 3e35142ef99fe6b4fe5d834ad43ee13cca10a2dc upstream.
    
    Since commit d1bcae833b32f1 ("ELF: Don't generate unused section
    symbols") [1], binutils (v2.36+) started dropping section symbols that
    it thought were unused.  This isn't an issue in general, but with
    kexec_file.c, gcc is placing kexec_arch_apply_relocations[_add] into a
    separate .text.unlikely section and the section symbol ".text.unlikely"
    is being dropped. Due to this, recordmcount is unable to find a non-weak
    symbol in .text.unlikely to generate a relocation record against.
    
    Address this by dropping the weak attribute from these functions.
    Instead, follow the existing pattern of having architectures #define the
    name of the function they want to override in their headers.

    fdt: Update CRC check for rng-seed
    
    commit dd753d961c4844a39f947be115b3d81e10376ee5 upstream.
    
    Commit 428826f5358c ("fdt: add support for rng-seed") moves of_fdt_crc32
    from early_init_dt_verify() to early_init_dt_scan() since
    early_init_dt_scan_chosen() may modify fdt to erase rng-seed.
    
    However, arm and some other arch won't call early_init_dt_scan(), they
    call early_init_dt_verify() then early_init_dt_scan_nodes().
    
    Restore of_fdt_crc32 to early_init_dt_verify() then update it in
    early_init_dt_scan_chosen() if fdt if updated.

    xen: unexport __init-annotated xen_xlate_map_ballooned_pages()
    
    commit dbac14a5a05ff8e1ce7c0da0e1f520ce39ec62ea upstream.
    
    EXPORT_SYMBOL and __init is a bad combination because the .init.text
    section is freed up after the initialization. Hence, modules cannot
    use symbols annotated __init. The access to a freed symbol may end up
    with kernel panic.
    
    modpost used to detect it, but it has been broken for a decade.
    
    Recently, I fixed modpost so it started to warn it again, then this
    showed up in linux-next builds.
    
    There are two ways to fix it:
    
      - Remove __init
      - Remove EXPORT_SYMBOL
    
    I chose the latter for this case because none of the in-tree call-sites
    (arch/arm/xen/enlighten.c, arch/x86/xen/grant-table.c) is compiled as
    modular.

    drm_fb_helper_modinit has a lot of boilerplate for what is not very
    simple functionality.  Just open code it in the only caller using
    IS_ENABLED and IS_MODULE, and skip the find_module check as a

    powerpc/pseries: wire up rng during setup_arch()
    
    commit e561e472a3d441753bd012333b057f48fef1045b upstream.
    
    The platform's RNG must be available before random_init() in order to be
    useful for initial seeding, which in turn means that it needs to be
    called from setup_arch(), rather than from an init call. Fortunately,
    each platform already has a setup_arch function pointer, which means
    it's easy to wire this up. This commit also removes some noisy log
    messages that don't add much.

    ARM: dts: imx6qdl: correct PU regulator ramp delay
    
    commit 93a8ba2a619816d631bd69e9ce2172b4d7a481b8 upstream.
    
    Contrary to what was believed at the time, the ramp delay of 150us is not
    plenty for the PU LDO with the default step time of 512 pulses of the 24MHz
    clock. Measurements have shown that after enabling the LDO the voltage on
    VDDPU_CAP jumps to ~750mV in the first step and after that the regulator
    executes the normal ramp up as defined by the step size control.
    
    This means it takes the regulator between 360us and 370us to ramp up to
    the nominal 1.15V voltage for this power domain. With the old setting of
    the ramp delay the power up of the PU GPC domain would happen in the middle
    of the regulator ramp with the voltage being at around 900mV. Apparently
    this was enough for most units to properly power up the peripherals in the
    domain and execute the reset. Some units however, fail to power up properly,
    especially when the chip is at a low temperature. In that case any access
    to the GPU registers would yield an incorrect result with no way to recover
    from this situation.
    
    Change the ramp delay to 380us to cover the measured ramp up time with a
    bit of additional slack.

    powerpc: Enable execve syscall exit tracepoint
    
    commit ec6d0dde71d760aa60316f8d1c9a1b0d99213529 upstream.
    
    On execve[at], we are zero'ing out most of the thread register state
    including gpr[0], which contains the syscall number. Due to this, we
    fail to trigger the syscall exit tracepoint properly. Fix this by
    retaining gpr[0] in the thread register state.

    iio:accel:bma180: rearrange iio trigger get and register
    
    commit e5f3205b04d7f95a2ef43bce4b454a7f264d6923 upstream.
    
    IIO trigger interface function iio_trigger_get() should be called after
    iio_trigger_register() (or its devm analogue) strictly, because of
    iio_trigger_get() acquires module refcnt based on the trigger->owner
    pointer, which is initialized inside iio_trigger_register() to
    THIS_MODULE.
    If this call order is wrong, the next iio_trigger_put() (from sysfs
    callback or "delete module" path) will dereference "default" module
    refcnt, which is incorrect behaviour.

    igb: Make DMA faster when CPU is active on the PCIe link
    
    [ Upstream commit 4e0effd9007ea0be31f7488611eb3824b4541554 ]
    
    Intel I210 on some Intel Alder Lake platforms can only achieve ~750Mbps
    Tx speed via iperf. The RR2DCDELAY shows around 0x2xxx DMA delay, which
    will be significantly lower when 1) ASPM is disabled or 2) SoC package
    c-state stays above PC3. When the RR2DCDELAY is around 0x1xxx the Tx
    speed can reach to ~950Mbps.
    
    According to the I210 datasheet "8.26.1 PCIe Misc. Register - PCIEMISC",
    "DMA Idle Indication" doesn't seem to tie to DMA coalesce anymore, so
    set it to 1b for "DMA is considered idle when there is no Rx or Tx AND
    when there are no TLPs indicating that CPU is active detected on the
    PCIe link (such as the host executes CSR or Configuration register read
    or write operation)" and performing Tx should also fall under "active
    CPU on PCIe link" case.
    
    In addition to that, commit b6e0c419f040 ("igb: Move DMA Coalescing init
    code to separate function.") seems to wrongly changed from enabling
    E1000_PCIEMISC_LX_DECISION to disabling it, also fix that.

    random: quiet urandom warning ratelimit suppression message
    
    commit c01d4d0a82b71857be7449380338bc53dde2da92 upstream.
    
    random.c ratelimits how much it warns about uninitialized urandom reads
    using __ratelimit(). When the RNG is finally initialized, it prints the
    number of missed messages due to ratelimiting.
    
    It has been this way since that functionality was introduced back in
    2018. Recently, cc1e127bfa95 ("random: remove ratelimiting for in-kernel
    unseeded randomness") put a bit more stress on the urandom ratelimiting,
    which teased out a bug in the implementation.
    
    Specifically, when under pressure, __ratelimit() will print its own
    message and reset the count back to 0, making the final message at the
    end less useful. Secondly, it does so as a pr_warn(), which apparently
    is undesirable for people's CI.
    
    Fortunately, __ratelimit() has the RATELIMIT_MSG_ON_RELEASE flag exactly
    for this purpose, so we set the flag.

    dm era: commit metadata in postsuspend after worker stops
    
    commit 9ae6e8b1c9bbf6874163d1243e393137313762b7 upstream.
    
    During postsuspend dm-era does the following:
    
    1. Archives the current era
    2. Commits the metadata, as part of the RPC call for archiving the
       current era
    3. Stops the worker
    
    Until the worker stops, it might write to the metadata again. Moreover,
    these writes are not flushed to disk immediately, but are cached by the
    dm-bufio client, which writes them back asynchronously.
    
    As a result, the committed metadata of a suspended dm-era device might
    not be consistent with the in-core metadata.
    
    In some cases, this can result in the corruption of the on-disk
    metadata. Suppose the following sequence of events:
    
    1. Load a new table, e.g. a snapshot-origin table, to a device with a
       dm-era table
    2. Suspend the device
    3. dm-era commits its metadata, but the worker does a few more metadata
       writes until it stops, as part of digesting an archived writeset
    4. These writes are cached by the dm-bufio client
    5. Load the dm-era table to another device.
    6. The new instance of the dm-era target loads the committed, on-disk
       metadata, which don't include the extra writes done by the worker
       after the metadata commit.
    7. Resume the new device
    8. The new dm-era target instance starts using the metadata
    9. Resume the original device
    10. The destructor of the old dm-era target instance is called and
        destroys the dm-bufio client, which results in flushing the cached
        writes to disk
    11. These writes might overwrite the writes done by the new dm-era
        instance, hence corrupting its metadata.
    
    Fix this by committing the metadata after the worker stops running.
    
    stop_worker uses flush_workqueue to flush the current work. However, the
    work item may re-queue itself and flush_workqueue doesn't wait for
    re-queued works to finish.
    
    This could result in the worker changing the metadata after they have
    been committed, or writing to the metadata concurrently with the commit
    in the postsuspend thread.
    
    Use drain_workqueue instead, which waits until the work and all
    re-queued works finish.

    random: schedule mix_interrupt_randomness() less often
    
    commit 534d2eaf1970274150596fdd2bf552721e65d6b2 upstream.
    
    It used to be that mix_interrupt_randomness() would credit 1 bit each
    time it ran, and so add_interrupt_randomness() would schedule mix() to
    run every 64 interrupts, a fairly arbitrary number, but nonetheless
    considered to be a decent enough conservative estimate.
    
    Since e3e33fc2ea7f ("random: do not use input pool from hard IRQs"),
    mix() is now able to credit multiple bits, depending on the number of
    calls to add(). This was done for reasons separate from this commit, but
    it has the nice side effect of enabling this patch to schedule mix()
    less often.
    
    Currently the rules are:
    a) Credit 1 bit for every 64 calls to add().
    b) Schedule mix() once a second that add() is called.
    c) Schedule mix() once every 64 calls to add().
    
    Rules (a) and (c) no longer need to be coupled. It's still important to
    have _some_ value in (c), so that we don't "over-saturate" the fast
    pool, but the once per second we get from rule (b) is a plenty enough
    baseline. So, by increasing the 64 in rule (c) to something larger, we
    avoid calling queue_work_on() as frequently during irq storms.
    
    This commit changes that 64 in rule (c) to be 1024, which means we
    schedule mix() 16 times less often. And it does *not* need to change the
    64 in rule (a).

    vt: drop old FONT ioctls
    
    commit ff2047fb755d4415ec3c70ac799889371151796d upstream.
    
    Drop support for these ioctls:
    * PIO_FONT, PIO_FONTX
    * GIO_FONT, GIO_FONTX
    * PIO_FONTRESET
    
    As was demonstrated by commit 90bfdeef83f1 (tty: make FONTX ioctl use
    the tty pointer they were actually passed), these ioctls are not used
    from userspace, as:
    1) they used to be broken (set up font on current console, not the open
       one) and racy (before the commit above)
    2) KDFONTOP ioctl is used for years instead
    
    Note that PIO_FONTRESET is defunct on most systems as VGA_CONSOLE is set
    on them for ages. That turns on BROKEN_GRAPHICS_PROGRAMS which makes
    PIO_FONTRESET just return an error.
    
    We are removing KD_FONT_FLAG_OLD here as it was used only by these
    removed ioctls. kd.h header exists both in kernel and uapi headers, so
    we can remove the kernel one completely. Everyone includeing kd.h will
    now automatically get the uapi one.
    
    There are now unused definitions of the ioctl numbers and "struct
    consolefontdesc" in kd.h, but as it is a uapi header, I am not touching
    these.
