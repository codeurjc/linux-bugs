    ipc/sem: Fix dangling sem_array access in semtimedop race
    
    [ Upstream commit b52be557e24c47286738276121177a41f54e3b83 ]
    
    When __do_semtimedop() goes to sleep because it has to wait for a
    semaphore value becoming zero or becoming bigger than some threshold, it
    links the on-stack sem_queue to the sem_array, then goes to sleep
    without holding a reference on the sem_array.
    
    When __do_semtimedop() comes back out of sleep, one of two things must
    happen:
    
     a) We prove that the on-stack sem_queue has been disconnected from the
        (possibly freed) sem_array, making it safe to return from the stack
        frame that the sem_queue exists in.
    
     b) We stabilize our reference to the sem_array, lock the sem_array, and
        detach the sem_queue from the sem_array ourselves.
    
    sem_array has RCU lifetime, so for case (b), the reference can be
    stabilized inside an RCU read-side critical section by locklessly
    checking whether the sem_queue is still connected to the sem_array.
    
    However, the current code does the lockless check on sem_queue before
    starting an RCU read-side critical section, so the result of the
    lockless check immediately becomes useless.
    
    Fix it by doing rcu_read_lock() before the lockless check.  Now RCU
    ensures that if we observe the object being on our queue, the object
    can't be freed until rcu_read_unlock().
    
    This bug is only hittable on kernel builds with full preemption support
    (either CONFIG_PREEMPT or PREEMPT_DYNAMIC with preempt=full).

    mmc: sdhci: Fix voltage switch delay
    
    commit c981cdfb9925f64a364f13c2b4f98f877308a408 upstream.
    
    Commit 20b92a30b561 ("mmc: sdhci: update signal voltage switch code")
    removed voltage switch delays from sdhci because mmc core had been
    enhanced to support them. However that assumed that sdhci_set_ios()
    did a single clock change, which it did not, and so the delays in mmc
    core, which should have come after the first clock change, were not
    effective.
    
    Fix by avoiding re-configuring UHS and preset settings when the clock
    is turning on and the settings have not changed. That then also avoids
    the associated clock changes, so that then sdhci_set_ios() does a single
    clock change when voltage switching, and the mmc core delays become
    effective.
    
    To do that has meant keeping track of driver strength (host->drv_type),
    and cases of reinitialization (host->reinit_uhs).
    
    Note also, the 'turning_on_clk' restriction should not be necessary
    but is done to minimize the impact of the change on stable kernels.

    x86/ioremap: Fix page aligned size calculation in __ioremap_caller()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4dbd6a3e90e03130973688fd79e19425f720d999 ]
    
    Current code re-calculates the size after aligning the starting and
    ending physical addresses on a page boundary. But the re-calculation
    also embeds the masking of high order bits that exceed the size of
    the physical address space (via PHYSICAL_PAGE_MASK). If the masking
    removes any high order bits, the size calculation results in a huge
    value that is likely to immediately fail.
    
    Fix this by re-calculating the page-aligned size first. Then mask any
    high order bits using PHYSICAL_PAGE_MASK.

    x86/pm: Add enumeration check before spec MSRs save/restore setup
    
    commit 50bcceb7724e471d9b591803889df45dcbb584bc upstream.
    
    pm_save_spec_msr() keeps a list of all the MSRs which _might_ need
    to be saved and restored at hibernate and resume. However, it has
    zero awareness of CPU support for these MSRs. It mostly works by
    unconditionally attempting to manipulate these MSRs and relying on
    rdmsrl_safe() being able to handle a #GP on CPUs where the support is
    unavailable.
    
    However, it's possible for reads (RDMSR) to be supported for a given MSR
    while writes (WRMSR) are not. In this case, msr_build_context() sees
    a successful read (RDMSR) and marks the MSR as valid. Then, later, a
    write (WRMSR) fails, producing a nasty (but harmless) error message.
    This causes restore_processor_state() to try and restore it, but writing
    this MSR is not allowed on the Intel Atom N2600 leading to:
    
      unchecked MSR access error: WRMSR to 0x122 (tried to write 0x0000000000000002) \
         at rIP: 0xffffffff8b07a574 (native_write_msr+0x4/0x20)

    To fix this, add the corresponding X86_FEATURE bit for each MSR.  Avoid
    trying to manipulate the MSR when the feature bit is clear. This
    required adding a X86_FEATURE bit for MSRs that do not have one already,
    but it's a small price to pay.

    x86/tsx: Add a feature bit for TSX control MSR support
    
    commit aaa65d17eec372c6a9756833f3964ba05b05ea14 upstream.
    
    Support for the TSX control MSR is enumerated in MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES.
    This is different from how other CPU features are enumerated i.e. via
    CPUID. Currently, a call to tsx_ctrl_is_supported() is required for
    enumerating the feature. In the absence of a feature bit for TSX control,
    any code that relies on checking feature bits directly will not work.
    
    In preparation for adding a feature bit check in MSR save/restore
    during suspend/resume, set a new feature bit X86_FEATURE_TSX_CTRL when
    MSR_IA32_TSX_CTRL is present.

    tcp/udp: Fix memory leak in ipv6_renew_options().
    
    commit 3c52c6bb831f6335c176a0fc7214e26f43adbd11 upstream.
    
    syzbot reported a memory leak [0] related to IPV6_ADDRFORM.
    
    The scenario is that while one thread is converting an IPv6 socket into
    IPv4 with IPV6_ADDRFORM, another thread calls do_ipv6_setsockopt() and
    allocates memory to inet6_sk(sk)->XXX after conversion.
    
    Then, the converted sk with (tcp|udp)_prot never frees the IPv6 resources,
    which inet6_destroy_sock() should have cleaned up.
    
    setsockopt(IPV6_ADDRFORM)                 setsockopt(IPV6_DSTOPTS)
    +-----------------------+                 +----------------------+
    - do_ipv6_setsockopt(sk, ...)
      - sockopt_lock_sock(sk)                 - do_ipv6_setsockopt(sk, ...)
        - lock_sock(sk)                         ^._ called via tcpv6_prot
      - WRITE_ONCE(sk->sk_prot, &tcp_prot)          before WRITE_ONCE()
      - xchg(&np->opt, NULL)
      - txopt_put(opt)
      - sockopt_release_sock(sk)
        - release_sock(sk)                      - sockopt_lock_sock(sk)
                                                  - lock_sock(sk)
                                                - ipv6_set_opt_hdr(sk, ...)
                                                  - ipv6_update_options(sk, opt)
                                                    - xchg(&inet6_sk(sk)->opt, opt)
                                                      ^._ opt is never freed.
    
                                                - sockopt_release_sock(sk)
                                                  - release_sock(sk)
    
    Since IPV6_DSTOPTS allocates options under lock_sock(), we can avoid this
    memory leak by testing whether sk_family is changed by IPV6_ADDRFORM after
    acquiring the lock.
    
    This issue exists from the initial commit between IPV6_ADDRFORM and
    IPV6_PKTOPTIONS.

    parisc: Increase FRAME_WARN to 2048 bytes on parisc
    
    [ Upstream commit 8d192bec534bd5b778135769a12e5f04580771f7 ]
    
    PA-RISC uses a much bigger frame size for functions than other
    architectures. So increase it to 2048 for 32- and 64-bit kernels.
    This fixes e.g. a warning in lib/xxhash.c.

    xtensa: increase size of gcc stack frame check
    
    [ Upstream commit 867050247e295cf20fce046a92a7e6491fcfe066 ]
    
    xtensa frame size is larger than the frame size for almost all other
    architectures.  This results in more than 50 "the frame size of <n> is
    larger than 1024 bytes" errors when trying to build xtensa:allmodconfig.
    
    Increase frame size for xtensa to 1536 bytes to avoid compile errors due
    to frame size limits.

    iommu/vt-d: Fix PCI device refcount leak in dmar_dev_scope_init()
    
    [ Upstream commit 4bedbbd782ebbe7287231fea862c158d4f08a9e3 ]
    
    for_each_pci_dev() is implemented by pci_get_device(). The comment of
    pci_get_device() says that it will increase the reference count for the
    returned pci_dev and also decrease the reference count for the input
    pci_dev @from if it is not NULL.
    
    If we break for_each_pci_dev() loop with pdev not NULL, we need to call
    pci_dev_put() to decrease the reference count. Add the missing
    pci_dev_put() for the error path to avoid reference count leak.

    mm: Fix '.data.once' orphan section warning
    
    Portions of upstream commit a4055888629b ("mm/memcg: warning on !memcg
    after readahead page charged") were backported as commit cfe575954ddd
    ("mm: add VM_WARN_ON_ONCE_PAGE() macro"). Unfortunately, the backport
    did not account for the lack of commit 33def8498fdd ("treewide: Convert
    macro and uses of __section(foo) to __section("foo")") in kernels prior
    to 5.10, resulting in the following orphan section warnings on PowerPC
    clang builds with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM=y:
    
      powerpc64le-linux-gnu-ld: warning: orphan section `".data.once"' from `mm/huge_memory.o' being placed in section `".data.once"'
      powerpc64le-linux-gnu-ld: warning: orphan section `".data.once"' from `mm/huge_memory.o' being placed in section `".data.once"'
      powerpc64le-linux-gnu-ld: warning: orphan section `".data.once"' from `mm/huge_memory.o' being placed in section `".data.once"'
    
    This is a difference between how clang and gcc handle macro
    stringification, which was resolved for the kernel by not stringifying
    the argument to the __section() macro. Since that change was deemed not
    suitable for the stable kernels by commit 59f89518f510 ("once: fix
    section mismatch on clang builds"), do that same thing as that change
    and remove the quotes from the argument to __section().

    arm64: errata: Fix KVM Spectre-v2 mitigation selection for Cortex-A57/A72
    
    Both the Spectre-v2 and Spectre-BHB mitigations involve running a sequence
    immediately after exiting a guest, before any branches. In the stable
    kernels these sequences are built by copying templates into an empty vector
    slot.
    
    For Spectre-BHB, Cortex-A57 and A72 require the branchy loop with k=8.
    If Spectre-v2 needs mitigating at the same time, a firmware call to EL3 is
    needed. The work EL3 does at this point is also enough to mitigate
    Spectre-BHB.
    
    When enabling the Spectre-BHB mitigation, spectre_bhb_enable_mitigation()
    should check if a slot has already been allocated for Spectre-v2, meaning
    no work is needed for Spectre-BHB.
    
    This check was missed in the earlier backport, add it.

    arm64: Fix panic() when Spectre-v2 causes Spectre-BHB to re-allocate KVM vectors
    
    Sami reports that linux panic()s when resuming from suspend to RAM. This
    is because when CPUs are brought back online, they re-enable any
    necessary mitigations.
    
    The Spectre-v2 and Spectre-BHB mitigations interact as both need to
    done by KVM when exiting a guest. Slots KVM can use as vectors are
    allocated, and templates for the mitigation are patched into the vector.
    
    This fails if a new slot needs to be allocated once the kernel has finished
    booting as it is no-longer possible to modify KVM's vectors:

    This is only a problem on platforms where there is only one CPU that is
    vulnerable to both Spectre-v2 and Spectre-BHB.
    
    The Spectre-v2 mitigation identifies the slot it can re-use by the CPU's
    'fn'. It unconditionally writes the slot number and 'template_start'
    pointer. The Spectre-BHB mitigation identifies slots it can re-use by
    the CPU's template_start pointer, which was previously clobbered by the
    Spectre-v2 mitigation.
    
    When there is only one CPU that is vulnerable to both issues, this causes
    Spectre-v2 to try to allocate a new slot, which fails.
    
    Change both mitigations to check whether they are changing the slot this
    CPU uses before writing the percpu variables again.
    
    This issue only exists in the stable backports for Spectre-BHB which have
    to use totally different infrastructure to mainline.

    pinctrl: intel: Save and restore pins in "direct IRQ" mode
    
    commit 6989ea4881c8944fbf04378418bb1af63d875ef8 upstream.
    
    The firmware on some systems may configure GPIO pins to be
    an interrupt source in so called "direct IRQ" mode. In such
    cases the GPIO controller driver has no idea if those pins
    are being used or not. At the same time, there is a known bug
    in the firmwares that don't restore the pin settings correctly
    after suspend, i.e. by an unknown reason the Rx value becomes
    inverted.
    
    Hence, let's save and restore the pins that are configured
    as GPIOs in the input mode with GPIROUTIOXAPIC bit set.

    x86/bugs: Make sure MSR_SPEC_CTRL is updated properly upon resume from S3
    
    commit 66065157420c5b9b3f078f43d313c153e1ff7f83 upstream.
    
    The "force" argument to write_spec_ctrl_current() is currently ambiguous
    as it does not guarantee the MSR write. This is due to the optimization
    that writes to the MSR happen only when the new value differs from the
    cached value.
    
    This is fine in most cases, but breaks for S3 resume when the cached MSR
    value gets out of sync with the hardware MSR value due to S3 resetting
    it.
    
    When x86_spec_ctrl_current is same as x86_spec_ctrl_base, the MSR write
    is skipped. Which results in SPEC_CTRL mitigations not getting restored.
    
    Move the MSR write from write_spec_ctrl_current() to a new function that
    unconditionally writes to the MSR. Update the callers accordingly and
    rename functions.

    If DAT metadata file is corrupted on disk, there is a case where
    req->pr_desc_bh is NULL and blocknr is 0 at nilfs_dat_commit_end() during
    a b-tree operation that cascadingly updates ancestor nodes of the b-tree,
    because nilfs_dat_commit_alloc() for a lower level block can initialize
    the blocknr on the same DAT entry between nilfs_dat_prepare_end() and
    nilfs_dat_commit_end().
    
    If this happens, nilfs_dat_commit_end() calls nilfs_dat_commit_free()
    without valid buffer heads in req->pr_desc_bh and req->pr_bitmap_bh, and
    causes the NULL pointer dereference above in
    nilfs_palloc_commit_free_entry() function, which leads to a crash.
    
    Fix this by adding a NULL check on req->pr_desc_bh and req->pr_bitmap_bh
    before nilfs_palloc_commit_free_entry() in nilfs_dat_commit_free().
    
    This also calls nilfs_error() in that case to notify that there is a fatal
    flaw in the filesystem metadata and prevent further operations.

    tools/vm/slabinfo-gnuplot: use "grep -E" instead of "egrep"
    
    commit a435874bf626f55d7147026b059008c8de89fbb8 upstream.
    
    The latest version of grep claims the egrep is now obsolete so the build
    now contains warnings that look like:
    
            egrep: warning: egrep is obsolescent; using grep -E
    
    fix this up by moving the related file to use "grep -E" instead.
    
      sed -i "s/egrep/grep -E/g" `grep egrep -rwl tools/vm`
    
    Here are the steps to install the latest grep:
    
      wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/grep/grep-3.8.tar.gz
      tar xf grep-3.8.tar.gz
      cd grep-3.8 && ./configure && make
      sudo make install
      export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH

    error-injection: Add prompt for function error injection
    
    commit a4412fdd49dc011bcc2c0d81ac4cab7457092650 upstream.
    
    The config to be able to inject error codes into any function annotated
    with ALLOW_ERROR_INJECTION() is enabled when FUNCTION_ERROR_INJECTION is
    enabled.  But unfortunately, this is always enabled on x86 when KPROBES
    is enabled, and there's no way to turn it off.
    
    As kprobes is useful for observability of the kernel, it is useful to
    have it enabled in production environments.  But error injection should
    be avoided.  Add a prompt to the config to allow it to be disabled even
    when kprobes is enabled, and get rid of the "def_bool y".
    
    This is a kernel debug feature (it's in Kconfig.debug), and should have
    never been something enabled by default.

    This patch fixes the issue by calling sock_put() from tun_detach()

    qlcnic: fix sleep-in-atomic-context bugs caused by msleep
    
    [ Upstream commit 8dbd6e4ce1b9c527921643d9e34f188a10d4e893 ]
    
    The watchdog timer is used to monitor whether the process
    of transmitting data is timeout. If we use qlcnic driver,
    the dev_watchdog() that is the timer handler of watchdog
    timer will call qlcnic_tx_timeout() to process the timeout.
    But the qlcnic_tx_timeout() calls msleep(), as a result,
    the sleep-in-atomic-context bugs will happen. The processes
    are shown below:
    
       (atomic context)
    dev_watchdog
      qlcnic_tx_timeout
        qlcnic_83xx_idc_request_reset
          qlcnic_83xx_lock_driver
            msleep

            qlcnic_83xx_recover_driver_lock
              msleep
    
    Fix by changing msleep() to mdelay(), the mdelay() is
    busy-waiting and the bugs could be mitigated.

    scripts/faddr2line: Fix regression in name resolution on ppc64le
    
    [ Upstream commit 2d77de1581bb5b470486edaf17a7d70151131afd ]
    
    Commit 1d1a0e7c5100 ("scripts/faddr2line: Fix overlapping text section
    failures") can cause faddr2line to fail on ppc64le on some
    distributions, while it works fine on other distributions. The failure
    can be attributed to differences in the readelf output.
    
      $ ./scripts/faddr2line vmlinux find_busiest_group+0x00
      no match for find_busiest_group+0x00
    
    On ppc64le, readelf adds the localentry tag before the symbol name on
    some distributions, and adds the localentry tag after the symbol name on
    other distributions. This problem has been discussed previously:
    
      https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/20191211160133.GB4580@calabresa/
    
    This problem can be overcome by filtering out the localentry tags in the
    readelf output. Similar fixes are already present in the kernel by way
    of the following commits:

    v4l2: don't fall back to follow_pfn() if pin_user_pages_fast() fails
    
    commit 6647e76ab623b2b3fb2efe03a86e9c9046c52c33 upstream.
    
    The V4L2_MEMORY_USERPTR interface is long deprecated and shouldn't be
    used (and is discouraged for any modern v4l drivers).  And Seth Jenkins
    points out that the fallback to VM_PFNMAP/VM_IO is fundamentally racy
    and dangerous.
    
    Note that it's not even a case that should trigger, since any normal
    user pointer logic ends up just using the pin_user_pages_fast() call
    that does the proper page reference counting.  That's not the problem
    case, only if you try to use special device mappings do you have any
    issues.
    
    Normally I'd just remove this during the merge window, but since Seth
    pointed out the problem cases, we really want to know as soon as
    possible if there are actually any users of this odd special case of a
    legacy interface.  Neither Hans nor Mauro seem to think that such
    mis-uses of the old legacy interface should exist.  As Mauro says:
    
     "See, V4L2 has actually 4 streaming APIs:
            - Kernel-allocated mmap (usually referred simply as just mmap);
            - USERPTR mmap;
            - read();
            - dmabuf;
    
      The USERPTR is one of the oldest way to use it, coming from V4L
      version 1 times, and by far the least used one"
    
    And Hans chimed in on the USERPTR interface:
    
     "To be honest, I wouldn't mind if it goes away completely, but that's a
      bit of a pipe dream right now"
    
    but while removing this legacy interface entirely may be a pipe dream we
    can at least try to remove the unlikely (and actively broken) case of
    using special device mappings for USERPTR accesses.
    
    This replaces it with a WARN_ONCE() that we can remove once we've
    hopefully confirmed that no actual users exist.
    
    NOTE! Longer term, this means that a 'struct frame_vector' only ever
    contains proper page pointers, and all the games we have with converting
    them to pages can go away (grep for 'frame_vector_to_pages()' and the
    uses of 'vec->is_pfns').  But this is just the first step, to verify
    that this code really is all dead, and do so as quickly as possible.

    proc: proc_skip_spaces() shouldn't think it is working on C strings
    
    commit bce9332220bd677d83b19d21502776ad555a0e73 upstream.
    
    proc_skip_spaces() seems to think it is working on C strings, and ends
    up being just a wrapper around skip_spaces() with a really odd calling
    convention.
    
    Instead of basing it on skip_spaces(), it should have looked more like
    proc_skip_char(), which really is the exact same function (except it
    skips a particular character, rather than whitespace).  So use that as
    inspiration, odd coding and all.
    
    Now the calling convention actually makes sense and works for the
    intended purpose.

    proc: avoid integer type confusion in get_proc_long
    
    commit e6cfaf34be9fcd1a8285a294e18986bfc41a409c upstream.
    
    proc_get_long() is passed a size_t, but then assigns it to an 'int'
    variable for the length.  Let's not do that, even if our IO paths are
    limited to MAX_RW_COUNT (exactly because of these kinds of type errors).
    
    So do the proper test in the rigth type.

    spi: spi-imx: Fix spi_bus_clk if requested clock is higher than input clock
    
    [ Upstream commit db2d2dc9a0b58c6faefb6b002fdbed4f0362d1a4 ]
    
    In case the requested bus clock is higher than the input clock, the correct
    dividers (pre = 0, post = 0) are returned from mx51_ecspi_clkdiv(), but
    *fres is left uninitialized and therefore contains an arbitrary value.
    
    This causes trouble for the recently introduced PIO polling feature as the
    value in spi_imx->spi_bus_clk is used there to calculate for which
    transfers to enable PIO polling.
    
    Fix this by setting *fres even if no clock dividers are in use.
    
    This issue was observed on Kontron BL i.MX8MM with an SPI peripheral clock set
    to 50 MHz by default and a requested SPI bus clock of 80 MHz for the SPI NOR
    flash.
    
    With the fix applied the debug message from mx51_ecspi_clkdiv() now prints the
    following:
    
    spi_imx 30820000.spi: mx51_ecspi_clkdiv: fin: 50000000, fspi: 50000000,
    post: 0, pre: 0

    drm/amd/dc/dce120: Fix audio register mapping, stop triggering KASAN
    
    commit 44035ec2fde1114254ee465f9ba3bb246b0b6283 upstream.
    
    There's been a very long running bug that seems to have been neglected for
    a while, where amdgpu consistently triggers a KASAN error at start:
    
      BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in read_indirect_azalia_reg+0x1d4/0x2a0 [amdgpu]
      Read of size 4 at addr ffffffffc2274b28 by task modprobe/1889
    
    After digging through amd's rather creative method for accessing registers,
    I eventually discovered the problem likely has to do with the fact that on
    my dce120 GPU there are supposedly 7 sets of audio registers. But we only
    define a register mapping for 6 sets.
    
    So, fix this and fix the KASAN warning finally.

    This commit flushes the journal on suspend. It is prerequisite for the
    next commit that enables activating dm integrity devices in read-only mode.
    
    Note that we deliberately didn't flush the journal on suspend, so that the
    journal replay code would be tested. However, the dm-integrity code is 5
    years old now, so that journal replay is well-tested, and we can make this

    tcp: configurable source port perturb table size
    
    [ Upstream commit aeac4ec8f46d610a10adbaeff5e2edf6a88ffc62 ]
    
    On embedded systems with little memory and no relevant
    security concerns, it is beneficial to reduce the size
    of the table.
    
    Reducing the size from 2^16 to 2^8 saves 255 KiB
    of kernel RAM.
    
    Makes the table size configurable as an expert option.
    
    The size was previously increased from 2^8 to 2^16
    in commit 4c2c8f03a5ab ("tcp: increase source port perturb table to
    2^16").

    serial: 8250: 8250_omap: Avoid RS485 RTS glitch on ->set_termios()
    
    [ Upstream commit 038ee49fef18710bedd38b531d173ccd746b2d8d ]
    
    RS485-enabled UART ports on TI Sitara SoCs with active-low polarity
    exhibit a Transmit Enable glitch on ->set_termios():
    
    omap8250_restore_regs(), which is called from omap_8250_set_termios(),
    sets the TCRTLR bit in the MCR register and clears all other bits,
    including RTS.  If RTS uses active-low polarity, it is now asserted
    for no reason.
    
    The TCRTLR bit is subsequently cleared by writing up->mcr to the MCR
    register.  That variable is always zero, so the RTS bit is still cleared
    (incorrectly so if RTS is active-high).
    
    (up->mcr is not, as one might think, a cache of the MCR register's
    current value.  Rather, it only caches a single bit of that register,
    the AFE bit.  And it only does so if the UART supports the AFE bit,
    which OMAP does not.  For details see serial8250_do_set_termios() and
    serial8250_do_set_mctrl().)
    
    Finally at the end of omap8250_restore_regs(), the MCR register is
    restored (and RTS deasserted) by a call to up->port.ops->set_mctrl()
    (which equals serial8250_set_mctrl()) and serial8250_em485_stop_tx().
    
    So there's an RTS glitch between setting TCRTLR and calling
    serial8250_em485_stop_tx().  Avoid by using a read-modify-write
    when setting TCRTLR.
    
    While at it, drop a redundant initialization of up->mcr.  As explained
    above, the variable isn't used by the driver and it is already
    initialized to zero because it is part of the static struct
    serial8250_ports[] declared in 8250_core.c.  (Static structs are
    initialized to zero per section 6.7.8 nr. 10 of the C99 standard.)

    nilfs2: fix nilfs_sufile_mark_dirty() not set segment usage as dirty
    
    commit 512c5ca01a3610ab14ff6309db363de51f1c13a6 upstream.
    
    When extending segments, nilfs_sufile_alloc() is called to get an
    unassigned segment, then mark it as dirty to avoid accidentally allocating
    the same segment in the future.
    
    But for some special cases such as a corrupted image it can be unreliable.
    If such corruption of the dirty state of the segment occurs, nilfs2 may
    reallocate a segment that is in use and pick the same segment for writing
    twice at the same time.
    
    This will cause the problem reported by syzkaller:
    https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=c7c4748e11ffcc367cef04f76e02e931833cbd24
    
    This case started with segbuf1.segnum = 3, nextnum = 4 when constructed.
    It supposed segment 4 has already been allocated and marked as dirty.
    
    However the dirty state was corrupted and segment 4 usage was not dirty.
    For the first time nilfs_segctor_extend_segments() segment 4 was allocated
    again, which made segbuf2 and next segbuf3 had same segment 4.
    
    sb_getblk() will get same bh for segbuf2 and segbuf3, and this bh is added
    to both buffer lists of two segbuf.  It makes the lists broken which
    causes NULL pointer dereference.
    
    Fix the problem by setting usage as dirty every time in
    nilfs_sufile_mark_dirty(), which is called during constructing current
    segment to be written out and before allocating next segment.

    ceph: do not update snapshot context when there is no new snapshot
    
    [ Upstream commit 2e586641c950e7f3e7e008404bd783a466b9b590 ]
    
    We will only track the uppest parent snapshot realm from which we
    need to rebuild the snapshot contexts _downward_ in hierarchy. For
    all the others having no new snapshot we will do nothing.
    
    This fix will avoid calling ceph_queue_cap_snap() on some inodes
    inappropriately. For example, with the code in mainline, suppose there
    are 2 directory hierarchies (with 6 directories total), like this:
    
    /dir_X1/dir_X2/dir_X3/
    /dir_Y1/dir_Y2/dir_Y3/
    
    Firstly, make a snapshot under /dir_X1/dir_X2/.snap/snap_X2, then make a
    root snapshot under /.snap/root_snap. Every time we make snapshots under
    /dir_Y1/..., the kclient will always try to rebuild the snap context for
    snap_X2 realm and finally will always try to queue cap snaps for dir_Y2
    and dir_Y3, which makes no sense.
    
    That's because the snap_X2's seq is 2 and root_snap's seq is 3. So when
    creating a new snapshot under /dir_Y1/... the new seq will be 4, and
    the mds will send the kclient a snapshot backtrace in _downward_
    order: seqs 4, 3.
    
    When ceph_update_snap_trace() is called, it will always rebuild the from
    the last realm, that's the root_snap. So later when rebuilding the snap
    context, the current logic will always cause it to rebuild the snap_X2
    realm and then try to queue cap snaps for all the inodes related in that
    realm, even though it's not necessary.
    
    This is accompanied by a lot of these sorts of dout messages:
    
        "ceph:  queue_cap_snap 00000000a42b796b nothing dirty|writing"
    
    Fix the logic to avoid this situation.
    
    Also, the 'invalidate' word is not precise here. In actuality, it will
    cause a rebuild of the existing snapshot contexts or just build
    non-existent ones. Rename it to 'rebuild_snapcs'.

    iio: ms5611: Simplify IO callback parameters
    
    [ Upstream commit dc19fa63ad80a636fdbc1a02153d1ab140cb901f ]
    
    The ms5611 passes &indio_dev->dev as a parameter to all its IO callbacks
    only to directly cast the struct device back to struct iio_dev. And the
    struct iio_dev is then only used to get the drivers state struct.
    
    Simplify this a bit by passing the state struct directly. This makes it a
    bit easier to follow what the code is doing.

    s390/crashdump: fix TOD programmable field size
    
    [ Upstream commit f44e07a8afdd713ddc1a8832c39372fe5dd86895 ]
    
    The size of the TOD programmable field was incorrectly increased from
    four to eight bytes with commit 1a2c5840acf9 ("s390/dump: cleanup CPU
    save area handling").
    This leads to an elf notes section NT_S390_TODPREG which has a size of
    eight instead of four bytes in case of kdump, however even worse is
    that the contents is incorrect: it is supposed to contain only the
    contents of the TOD programmable field, but in fact contains a mix of
    the TOD programmable field (32 bit upper bits) and parts of the CPU
    timer register (lower 32 bits).
    
    Fix this by simply changing the size of the todpreg field within the
    save area structure. This will implicitly also fix the size of the
    corresponding elf notes sections.
    
    This also gets rid of this compile time warning:
    
    in function ‘fortify_memcpy_chk’,
        inlined from ‘save_area_add_regs’ at arch/s390/kernel/crash_dump.c:99:2:

    s390/dasd: fix no record found for raw_track_access
    
    [ Upstream commit 590ce6d96d6a224b470a3862c33a483d5022bfdb ]
    
    For DASD devices in raw_track_access mode only full track images are
    read and written.
    For this purpose it is not necessary to do search operation in the
    locate record extended function. The documentation even states that
    this might fail if the searched record is not found on a track.
    
    Currently the driver sets a value of 1 in the search field for the first
    record after record zero. This is the default for disks not in
    raw_track_access mode but record 1 might be missing on a completely
    empty track.
    
    There has not been any problem with this on IBM storage servers but it
    might lead to errors with DASD devices on other vendors storage servers.
    
    Fix this by setting the search field to 0. Record zero is always available
    even on a completely empty track.

    dccp/tcp: Reset saddr on failure after inet6?_hash_connect().
    
    [ Upstream commit 77934dc6db0d2b111a8f2759e9ad2fb67f5cffa5 ]
    
    When connect() is called on a socket bound to the wildcard address,
    we change the socket's saddr to a local address.  If the socket
    fails to connect() to the destination, we have to reset the saddr.
    
    However, when an error occurs after inet_hash6?_connect() in
    (dccp|tcp)_v[46]_conect(), we forget to reset saddr and leave
    the socket bound to the address.
    
    From the user's point of view, whether saddr is reset or not varies
    with errno.  Let's fix this inconsistent behaviour.
    
    Note that after this patch, the repro [0] will trigger the WARN_ON()
    in inet_csk_get_port() again, but this patch is not buggy and rather
    fixes a bug papering over the bhash2's bug for which we need another
    fix.
    
    For the record, the repro causes -EADDRNOTAVAIL in inet_hash6_connect()
    by this sequence:
    
      s1 = socket()
      s1.setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
      s1.bind(('127.0.0.1', 10000))
      s1.sendto(b'hello', MSG_FASTOPEN, (('127.0.0.1', 10000)))
      # or s1.connect(('127.0.0.1', 10000))
    
      s2 = socket()
      s2.setsockopt(SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
      s2.bind(('0.0.0.0', 10000))
      s2.connect(('127.0.0.1', 10000))  # -EADDRNOTAVAIL

    tipc: add an extra conn_get in tipc_conn_alloc
    
    [ Upstream commit a7b42969d63f47320853a802efd879fbdc4e010e ]
    
    One extra conn_get() is needed in tipc_conn_alloc(), as after
    tipc_conn_alloc() is called, tipc_conn_close() may free this
    con before deferencing it in tipc_topsrv_accept():
    
       tipc_conn_alloc();
       newsk = newsock->sk;
                                     <---- tipc_conn_close();
       write_lock_bh(&sk->sk_callback_lock);
       newsk->sk_data_ready = tipc_conn_data_ready;
    
    Then an uaf issue can be triggered:
    
      BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in tipc_topsrv_accept+0x1e7/0x370 [tipc]
      Call Trace:

    This patch fixes it by holding it in tipc_conn_alloc(), then after
    all accessing in tipc_topsrv_accept() releasing it. Note when does
    this in tipc_topsrv_kern_subscr(), as tipc_conn_rcv_sub() returns

    tipc: set con sock in tipc_conn_alloc
    
    [ Upstream commit 0e5d56c64afcd6fd2d132ea972605b66f8a7d3c4 ]
    
    A crash was reported by Wei Chen:
    
      BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000018
      RIP: 0010:tipc_conn_close+0x12/0x100

    It was caused by !con->sock in tipc_conn_close(). In tipc_topsrv_accept(),
    con is allocated in conn_idr then its sock is set:
    
      con = tipc_conn_alloc();
      ...                    <----[1]
      con->sock = newsock;
    
    If tipc_conn_close() is called in anytime of [1], the null-pointer-def
    is triggered by con->sock->sk due to con->sock is not yet set.
    
    This patch fixes it by moving the con->sock setting to tipc_conn_alloc()
    under s->idr_lock. So that con->sock can never be NULL when getting the
    con from s->conn_idr. It will be also safer to move con->server and flag
    CF_CONNECTED setting under s->idr_lock, as they should all be set before
    tipc_conn_alloc() is called.

    There is no lock protection when deleting list in p9_conn_cancel(). After

    will cause issue of list_del corruption.
    
    Setting req->status to REQ_STATUS_ERROR under lock prevents other

    The other thread can safely check req->status because it still holds a
    reference to req at this point.

    [ Upstream commit 0ad6bded175e829c2ca261529c9dce39a32a042d ]
    
    Previously we leverage NCI_UNREG and the lock inside nci_close_device to
    prevent the race condition between opening a device and closing a
    device. However, it still has problem because a failed opening command
    will erase the NCI_UNREG flag and allow another opening command to
    bypass the status checking.
    
    This fix corrects that by making sure the NCI_UNREG is held.

    Since commit bf2aebccddef ("ASoC: sgtl5000: Fix noise on shutdown/remove"),
    the device power control registers are reset when the driver is
    removed/shutdown.
    
    This is an issue when the device is configured to use the PLL clock. The

    [ Upstream commit 8950f345a67d8046d2472dd6ea81fa18ef5b4844 ]
    
    Remove the regulators node and define fixed regulators in the root node.
    Prevents the sdhci-omap driver from waiting in probe deferral forever
    because of the missing vmmc-supply and keeps am335x-pcm-953 consistent with
    the other Phytec AM335 boards.

    [ Upstream commit 7f57f8165cb6d2c206e2b9ada53b9e2d6d8af42f ]
    
    The function pfkey_send_acquire may race with pfkey_register
    (which could even be in a different name space).  This may result
    in a buffer overrun.
    
    Allocating the maximum amount of memory that could be used prevents
    this.

    MIPS: pic32: treat port as signed integer
    
    [ Upstream commit 648060902aa302331b5d6e4f26d8ee0761d239ab ]
    
    get_port_from_cmdline() returns an int, yet is assigned to a char, which
    is wrong in its own right, but also, with char becoming unsigned, this
    poses problems, because -1 is used as an error value. Further
    complicating things, fw_init_early_console() is only ever called with a
    -1 argument. Fix this up by removing the unused argument from
    fw_init_early_console() and treating port as a proper signed integer.

    RISC-V: vdso: Do not add missing symbols to version section in linker script
    
    [ Upstream commit fcae44fd36d052e956e69a64642fc03820968d78 ]
    
    Recently, ld.lld moved from '--undefined-version' to
    '--no-undefined-version' as the default, which breaks the compat vDSO
    build:
    
      ld.lld: error: version script assignment of 'LINUX_4.15' to symbol '__vdso_gettimeofday' failed: symbol not defined
      ld.lld: error: version script assignment of 'LINUX_4.15' to symbol '__vdso_clock_gettime' failed: symbol not defined
      ld.lld: error: version script assignment of 'LINUX_4.15' to symbol '__vdso_clock_getres' failed: symbol not defined
    
    These symbols are not present in the compat vDSO or the regular vDSO for
    32-bit but they are unconditionally included in the version section of
    the linker script, which is prohibited with '--no-undefined-version'.
    
    Fix this issue by only including the symbols that are actually exported
    in the version section of the linker script.

    spi: stm32: fix stm32_spi_prepare_mbr() that halves spi clk for every run

    When this driver is used with a driver that uses preallocated spi_transfer
    structs. The speed_hz is halved by every run. This results in:
    
    spi_stm32 44004000.spi: SPI transfer setup failed
    ads7846 spi0.0: SPI transfer failed: -22
    
    Example when running with DIV_ROUND_UP():
    - First run; speed_hz = 1000000, spi->clk_rate 125000000
      div 125 -> mbrdiv = 7, cur_speed = 976562
    - Second run; speed_hz = 976562
      div 128,00007 (roundup to 129) -> mbrdiv = 8, cur_speed = 488281
    - Third run; speed_hz = 488281
      div 256,000131072067109 (roundup to 257) and then -EINVAL is returned.

    wifi: mac80211_hwsim: fix debugfs attribute ps with rc table support
    
    [ Upstream commit 69188df5f6e4cecc6b76b958979ba363cd5240e8 ]
    
    Fixes a warning that occurs when rc table support is enabled
    (IEEE80211_HW_SUPPORTS_RC_TABLE) in mac80211_hwsim and the PS mode
    is changed via the exported debugfs attribute.
    
    When the PS mode is changed, a packet is broadcasted via
    hwsim_send_nullfunc by creating and transmitting a plain skb with only
    header initialized. The ieee80211 rate array in the control buffer is
    zero-initialized. When ratetbl support is enabled, ieee80211_get_tx_rates
    is called for the skb with sta parameter set to NULL and thus no
    ratetbl can be used. The final rate array then looks like
    [-1,0; 0,0; 0,0; 0,0] which causes the warning in ieee80211_get_tx_rate.
    
    The issue is fixed by setting the count of the first rate with idx '0'
    to 1 and hence ieee80211_get_tx_rates won't overwrite it with idx '-1'.
