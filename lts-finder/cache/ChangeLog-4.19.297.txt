    xfrm6: fix inet6_dev refcount underflow problem
    
    [ Upstream commit cc9b364bb1d58d3dae270c7a931a8cc717dc2b3b ]
    
    There are race conditions that may lead to inet6_dev refcount underflow
    in xfrm6_dst_destroy() and rt6_uncached_list_flush_dev().
    
    One of the refcount underflow bugs is shown below:
            (cpu 1)                 |       (cpu 2)
    xfrm6_dst_destroy()             |
      ...                           |
      in6_dev_put()                 |
                                    |  rt6_uncached_list_flush_dev()
      ...                           |    ...
                                    |    in6_dev_put()
      rt6_uncached_list_del()       |    ...
      ...                           |
    
    xfrm6_dst_destroy() calls rt6_uncached_list_del() after in6_dev_put(),
    so rt6_uncached_list_flush_dev() has a chance to call in6_dev_put()
    again for the same inet6_dev.
    
    Fix it by moving in6_dev_put() after rt6_uncached_list_del() in
    xfrm6_dst_destroy().

    Bluetooth: hci_sock: Correctly bounds check and pad HCI_MON_NEW_INDEX name
    
    commit cb3871b1cd135a6662b732fbc6b3db4afcdb4a64 upstream.
    
    The code pattern of memcpy(dst, src, strlen(src)) is almost always
    wrong. In this case it is wrong because it leaves memory uninitialized
    if it is less than sizeof(ni->name), and overflows ni->name when longer.
    
    Normally strtomem_pad() could be used here, but since ni->name is a
    trailing array in struct hci_mon_new_index, compilers that don't support
    -fstrict-flex-arrays=3 can't tell how large this array is via
    __builtin_object_size(). Instead, open-code the helper and use sizeof()
    since it will work correctly.
    
    Additionally mark ni->name as __nonstring since it appears to not be a
    %NUL terminated C string.

    s390/pci: fix iommu bitmap allocation
    
    commit c1ae1c59c8c6e0b66a718308c623e0cb394dab6b upstream.
    
    Since the fixed commits both zdev->iommu_bitmap and zdev->lazy_bitmap
    are allocated as vzalloc(zdev->iommu_pages / 8). The problem is that
    zdev->iommu_bitmap is a pointer to unsigned long but the above only
    yields an allocation that is a multiple of sizeof(unsigned long) which
    is 8 on s390x if the number of IOMMU pages is a multiple of 64.
    This in turn is the case only if the effective IOMMU aperture is
    a multiple of 64 * 4K = 256K. This is usually the case and so didn't
    cause visible issues since both the virt_to_phys(high_memory) reduced
    limit and hardware limits use nice numbers.
    
    Under KVM, and in particular with QEMU limiting the IOMMU aperture to
    the vfio DMA limit (default 65535), it is possible for the reported
    aperture not to be a multiple of 256K however. In this case we end up
    with an iommu_bitmap whose allocation is not a multiple of
    8 causing bitmap operations to access it out of bounds.
    
    Sadly we can't just fix this in the obvious way and use bitmap_zalloc()
    because for large RAM systems (tested on 8 TiB) the zdev->iommu_bitmap
    grows too large for kmalloc(). So add our own bitmap_vzalloc() wrapper.
    This might be a candidate for common code, but this area of code will
    be replaced by the upcoming conversion to use the common code DMA API on
    s390 so just add a local routine.
    
    Fixes: 224593215525 ("s390/pci: use virtual memory for iommu bitmap")
    Fixes: 13954fd6913a ("s390/pci_dma: improve lazy flush for unmap")

    perf: Disallow mis-matched inherited group reads
    
    commit 32671e3799ca2e4590773fd0e63aaa4229e50c06 upstream.
    
    Because group consistency is non-atomic between parent (filedesc) and children
    (inherited) events, it is possible for PERF_FORMAT_GROUP read() to try and sum
    non-matching counter groups -- with non-sensical results.
    
    Add group_generation to distinguish the case where a parent group removes and
    adds an event and thus has the same number, but a different configuration of
    events as inherited groups.
    
    This became a problem when commit fa8c269353d5 ("perf/core: Invert
    perf_read_group() loops") flipped the order of child_list and sibling_list.
    Previously it would iterate the group (sibling_list) first, and for each
    sibling traverse the child_list. In this order, only the group composition of
    the parent is relevant. By flipping the order the group composition of the
    child (inherited) events becomes an issue and the mis-match in group
    composition becomes evident.
    
    That said; even prior to this commit, while reading of a group that is not
    equally inherited was not broken, it still made no sense.
    
    (Ab)use ECHILD as error return to indicate issues with child process group
    composition.

    ACPI: irq: Fix incorrect return value in acpi_register_gsi()
    
    commit 0c21a18d5d6c6a73d098fb9b4701572370942df9 upstream.
    
    acpi_register_gsi() should return a negative value in case of failure.
    
    Currently, it returns the return value from irq_create_fwspec_mapping().
    However, irq_create_fwspec_mapping() returns 0 for failure. Fix the
    issue by returning -EINVAL if irq_create_fwspec_mapping() returns zero.

    mmc: core: Capture correct oemid-bits for eMMC cards
    
    commit 84ee19bffc9306128cd0f1c650e89767079efeff upstream.
    
    The OEMID is an 8-bit binary number rather than 16-bit as the current code
    parses for. The OEMID occupies bits [111:104] in the CID register, see the
    eMMC spec JESD84-B51 paragraph 7.2.3. It seems that the 16-bit comes from
    the legacy MMC specs (v3.31 and before).
    
    Let's fix the parsing by simply move to use 8-bit instead of 16-bit. This
    means we ignore the impact on some of those old MMC cards that may be out
    there, but on the other hand this shouldn't be a problem as the OEMID seems
    not be an important feature for these cards.

    Bluetooth: hci_event: Fix using memcmp when comparing keys
    
    [ Upstream commit b541260615f601ae1b5d6d0cc54e790de706303b ]
    
    memcmp is not consider safe to use with cryptographic secrets:
    
     'Do  not  use memcmp() to compare security critical data, such as
     cryptographic secrets, because the required CPU time depends on the
     number of equal bytes.'
    
    While usage of memcmp for ZERO_KEY may not be considered a security
    critical data, it can lead to more usage of memcmp with pairing keys
    which could introduce more security problems.

    This was due to his config options and having KASAN turned on,

    Fix the warnings by initializing the different structs we're copying

    sky2: Make sure there is at least one frag_addr available
    
    [ Upstream commit 6a70e5cbedaf8ad10528ac9ac114f3ec20f422df ]
    
    In the pathological case of building sky2 with 16k PAGE_SIZE, the
    frag_addr[] array would never be used, so the original code was correct
    that size should be 0. But the compiler now gets upset with 0 size arrays
    in places where it hasn't eliminated the code that might access such an
    array (it can't figure out that in this case an rx skb with fragments
    would never be created). To keep the compiler happy, make sure there is
    at least 1 frag_addr in struct rx_ring_info:

    [ Upstream commit 61304336c67358d49a989e5e0060d8c99bad6ca8 ]
    
    Lower layer device driver stop/wake TX by calling ieee80211_stop_queue()/
    ieee80211_wake_queue() while hw scan. Sometimes hw scan and PTK rekey are
    running in parallel, when M4 sent from wpa_supplicant arrive while the TX
    queue is stopped, then the M4 will pending send, and then new key install
    from wpa_supplicant. After TX queue wake up by lower layer device driver,
    the M4 will be dropped by below call stack.
    
    When key install started, the current key flag is set KEY_FLAG_TAINTED in
    ieee80211_pairwise_rekey(), and then mac80211 wait key install complete by
    lower layer device driver. Meanwhile ieee80211_tx_h_select_key() will return
    TX_DROP for the M4 in step 12 below, and then ieee80211_free_txskb() called
    by ieee80211_tx_dequeue(), so the M4 will not send and free, then the rekey
    process failed becaue AP not receive M4. Please see details in steps below.
    
    There are a interval between KEY_FLAG_TAINTED set for current key flag and
    install key complete by lower layer device driver, the KEY_FLAG_TAINTED is
    set in this interval, all packet including M4 will be dropped in this
    interval, the interval is step 8~13 as below.

    success.
    
    If lower layer device driver use new key/cipher to send the M4, then AP
    will/should drop the M4, then it is same result with this issue, AP will/
    should kick out station as well as this issue.

    Bluetooth: Avoid redundant authentication
    
    [ Upstream commit 1d8e801422d66e4b8c7b187c52196bef94eed887 ]
    
    While executing the Android 13 CTS Verifier Secure Server test on a
    ChromeOS device, it was observed that the Bluetooth host initiates
    authentication for an RFCOMM connection after SSP completes.
    When this happens, some Intel Bluetooth controllers, like AC9560, would
    disconnect with "Connection Rejected due to Security Reasons (0x0e)".
    
    Historically, BlueZ did not mandate this authentication while an
    authenticated combination key was already in use for the connection.
    This behavior was changed since commit 7b5a9241b780
    ("Bluetooth: Introduce requirements for security level 4").
    So, this patch addresses the aforementioned disconnection issue by
    restoring the previous behavior.

    There is a slab-out-of-bounds Write bug in hid-holtek-kbd driver.
    The problem is the driver assumes the device must have an input
    but some malicious devices violate this assumption.
    
    Fix this by checking hid_device's input is non-empty before its usage.

    tracing: relax trace_event_eval_update() execution with cond_resched()
    
    [ Upstream commit 23cce5f25491968b23fb9c399bbfb25f13870cd9 ]
    
    When kernel is compiled without preemption, the eval_map_work_func()
    (which calls trace_event_eval_update()) will not be preempted up to its
    complete execution. This can actually cause a problem since if another
    CPU call stop_machine(), the call will have to wait for the
    eval_map_work_func() function to finish executing in the workqueue
    before being able to be scheduled. This problem was observe on a SMP
    system at boot time, when the CPU calling the initcalls executed
    clocksource_done_booting() which in the end calls stop_machine(). We
    observed a 1 second delay because one CPU was executing
    eval_map_work_func() and was not preempted by the stop_machine() task.
    
    Adding a call to cond_resched() in trace_event_eval_update() allows
    other tasks to be executed and thus continue working asynchronously
    like before without blocking any pending task at boot time.

    gpio: timberdale: Fix potential deadlock on &tgpio->lock
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e8bc2dda5a7a8e2babc9975f4b11c9a6196e490 ]
    
    As timbgpio_irq_enable()/timbgpio_irq_disable() callback could be
    executed under irq context, it could introduce double locks on
    &tgpio->lock if it preempts other execution units requiring
    the same locks.
    
    timbgpio_gpio_set()
    --> timbgpio_update_bit()
    --> spin_lock(&tgpio->lock)
    <interrupt>
       --> timbgpio_irq_disable()
       --> spin_lock_irqsave(&tgpio->lock)
    
    This flaw was found by an experimental static analysis tool I am
    developing for irq-related deadlock.
    
    To prevent the potential deadlock, the patch uses spin_lock_irqsave()
    on &tgpio->lock inside timbgpio_gpio_set() to prevent the possible
    deadlock scenario.

    overlayfs: set ctime when setting mtime and atime
    
    [ Upstream commit 03dbab3bba5f009d053635c729d1244f2c8bad38 ]
    
    Nathan reported that he was seeing the new warning in
    setattr_copy_mgtime pop when starting podman containers. Overlayfs is
    trying to set the atime and mtime via notify_change without also
    setting the ctime.
    
    POSIX states that when the atime and mtime are updated via utimes() that
    we must also update the ctime to the current time. The situation with
    overlayfs copy-up is analogies, so add ATTR_CTIME to the bitmask.
    notify_change will fill in the value.

    The compiler is incorrect, as we only use this code when ins_len > 0,
    and when ins_len > 0 we have start_slot properly initialized.  However
    we generally find the -Wmaybe-uninitialized warnings valuable, so
    initialize start_slot to get rid of the warning.

    [ Upstream commit 1bf76df3fee56d6637718e267f7c34ed70d0c7dc ]
    
    When running a delayed tree reference, if we find a ref count different
    from 1, we return -EIO. This isn't an IO error, as it indicates either a
    bug in the delayed refs code or a memory corruption, so change the error
    code from -EIO to -EUCLEAN. Also tag the branch as 'unlikely' as this is
    not expected to ever happen, and change the error message to print the
    tree block's bytenr without the parenthesis (and there was a missing space
    between the 'block' word and the opening parenthesis), for consistency as
    that's the style we used everywhere else.

    [ Upstream commit 7563cf17dce0a875ba3d872acdc63a78ea344019 ]
    
    Direct calls to ops->connect() can overwrite the address parameter when
    used in conjunction with BPF SOCK_ADDR hooks. Recent changes to
    kernel_connect() ensure that callers are insulated from such side
    effects. This patch wraps the direct call to ops->connect() with
    kernel_connect() to prevent unexpected changes to the address passed to
    ceph_tcp_connect().
    
    This change was originally part of a larger patch targeting the net tree
    addressing all instances of unprotected calls to ops->connect()
    throughout the kernel, but this change was split up into several patches
    targeting various trees.

    libceph: fix unaligned accesses in ceph_entity_addr handling
    
    [ Upstream commit cede185b1ba3118e1912385db4812a37d9e9b205 ]
    
    GCC9 is throwing a lot of warnings about unaligned access. This patch
    fixes some of them by changing most of the sockaddr handling functions
    to take a pointer to struct ceph_entity_addr instead of struct
    sockaddr_storage.  The lower functions can then make copies or do
    unaligned accesses as needed.

    net: pktgen: Fix interface flags printing
    
    commit 1d30162f35c7a73fc2f8cdcdcdbd690bedb99d1a upstream.
    
    Device flags are displayed incorrectly:
    1) The comparison (i == F_FLOW_SEQ) is always false, because F_FLOW_SEQ
    is equal to (1 << FLOW_SEQ_SHIFT) == 2048, and the maximum value
    of the 'i' variable is (NR_PKT_FLAG - 1) == 17. It should be compared
    with FLOW_SEQ_SHIFT.
    
    2) Similarly to the F_IPSEC flag.
    
    3) Also add spaces to the print end of the string literal "spi:%u"
    to prevent the output from merging with the flag that follows.

    expired elements remain in the tree. On-demand gc also does not help in
    this case, because this is delete element path. Return NULL if element

    net/sched: sch_hfsc: upgrade 'rt' to 'sc' when it becomes a inner curve
    
    commit a13b67c9a015c4e21601ef9aa4ec9c5d972df1b4 upstream.
    
    Christian Theune says:
       I upgraded from 6.1.38 to 6.1.55 this morning and it broke my traffic shaping script,
       leaving me with a non-functional uplink on a remote router.
    
    A 'rt' curve cannot be used as a inner curve (parent class), but we were
    allowing such configurations since the qdisc was introduced. Such
    configurations would trigger a UAF as Budimir explains:
       The parent will have vttree_insert() called on it in init_vf(),
       but will not have vttree_remove() called on it in update_vf()
       because it does not have the HFSC_FSC flag set.
    
    The qdisc always assumes that inner classes have the HFSC_FSC flag set.
    This is by design as it doesn't make sense 'qdisc wise' for an 'rt'
    curve to be an inner curve.
    
    Budimir's original patch disallows users to add classes with a 'rt'
    parent, but this is too strict as it breaks users that have been using
    'rt' as a inner class. Another approach, taken by this patch, is to
    upgrade the inner 'rt' into a 'sc', warning the user in the process.
    It avoids the UAF reported by Budimir while also being more permissive
    to bad scripts/users/code using 'rt' as a inner class.
    
    Users checking the `tc class ls [...]` or `tc class get [...]` dumps would
    observe the curve change and are potentially breaking with this change.

    i40e: prevent crash on probe if hw registers have invalid values
    
    commit fc6f716a5069180c40a8c9b63631e97da34f64a3 upstream.
    
    The hardware provides the indexes of the first and the last available
    queue and VF. From the indexes, the driver calculates the numbers of
    queues and VFs. In theory, a faulty device might say the last index is
    smaller than the first index. In that case, the driver's calculation
    would underflow, it would attempt to write to non-existent registers
    outside of the ioremapped range and crash.
    
    I ran into this not by having a faulty device, but by an operator error.
    I accidentally ran a QE test meant for i40e devices on an ice device.
    The test used 'echo i40e > /sys/...ice PCI device.../driver_override',
    bound the driver to the device and crashed in one of the wr32 calls in
    i40e_clear_hw.
    
    Add checks to prevent underflows in the calculations of num_queues and
    num_vfs. With this fix, the wrong device probing reports errors and
    returns a failure without crashing.

    tcp: tsq: relax tcp_small_queue_check() when rtx queue contains a single skb
    
    commit f921a4a5bffa8a0005b190fb9421a7fc1fd716b6 upstream.
    
    In commit 75eefc6c59fd ("tcp: tsq: add a shortcut in tcp_small_queue_check()")
    we allowed to send an skb regardless of TSQ limits being hit if rtx queue
    was empty or had a single skb, in order to better fill the pipe
    when/if TX completions were slow.
    
    Then later, commit 75c119afe14f ("tcp: implement rb-tree based
    retransmit queue") accidentally removed the special case for
    one skb in rtx queue.
    
    Stefan Wahren reported a regression in single TCP flow throughput
    using a 100Mbit fec link, starting from commit 65466904b015 ("tcp: adjust
    TSO packet sizes based on min_rtt"). This last commit only made the
    regression more visible, because it locked the TCP flow on a particular
    behavior where TSQ prevented two skbs being pushed downstream,
    adding silences on the wire between each TSO packet.
    
    Many thanks to Stefan for his invaluable help !

    tcp: fix excessive TLP and RACK timeouts from HZ rounding
    
    commit 1c2709cfff1dedbb9591e989e2f001484208d914 upstream.
    
    We discovered from packet traces of slow loss recovery on kernels with
    the default HZ=250 setting (and min_rtt < 1ms) that after reordering,
    when receiving a SACKed sequence range, the RACK reordering timer was
    firing after about 16ms rather than the desired value of roughly
    min_rtt/4 + 2ms. The problem is largely due to the RACK reorder timer
    calculation adding in TCP_TIMEOUT_MIN, which is 2 jiffies. On kernels
    with HZ=250, this is 2*4ms = 8ms. The TLP timer calculation has the
    exact same issue.
    
    This commit fixes the TLP transmit timer and RACK reordering timer
    floor calculation to more closely match the intended 2ms floor even on
    kernels with HZ=250. It does this by adding in a new
    TCP_TIMEOUT_MIN_US floor of 2000 us and then converting to jiffies,
    instead of the current approach of converting to jiffies and then
    adding th TCP_TIMEOUT_MIN value of 2 jiffies.
    
    Our testing has verified that on kernels with HZ=1000, as expected,
    this does not produce significant changes in behavior, but on kernels
    with the default HZ=250 the latency improvement can be large. For
    example, our tests show that for HZ=250 kernels at low RTTs this fix
    roughly halves the latency for the RACK reorder timer: instead of
    mostly firing at 16ms it mostly fires at 8ms.

    net: rfkill: gpio: prevent value glitch during probe
    
    commit b2f750c3a80b285cd60c9346f8c96bd0a2a66cde upstream.
    
    When either reset- or shutdown-gpio have are initially deasserted,
    e.g. after a reboot - or when the hardware does not include pull-down,
    there will be a short toggle of both IOs to logical 0 and back to 1.
    
    It seems that the rfkill default is unblocked, so the driver should not
    glitch to output low during probe.
    It can lead e.g. to unexpected lte modem reconnect:
    
    [1] root@localhost:~# dmesg | grep "usb 2-1"
    [    2.136124] usb 2-1: new SuperSpeed USB device number 2 using xhci-hcd
    [   21.215278] usb 2-1: USB disconnect, device number 2
    [   28.833977] usb 2-1: new SuperSpeed USB device number 3 using xhci-hcd
    
    The glitch has been discovered on an arm64 board, now that device-tree
    support for the rfkill-gpio driver has finally appeared :).
    
    Change the flags for devm_gpiod_get_optional from GPIOD_OUT_LOW to
    GPIOD_ASIS to avoid any glitches.
    The rfkill driver will set the intended value during rfkill_sync_work.

    xfrm: fix a data-race in xfrm_gen_index()
    
    commit 3e4bc23926b83c3c67e5f61ae8571602754131a6 upstream.
    
    xfrm_gen_index() mutual exclusion uses net->xfrm.xfrm_policy_lock.
    
    This means we must use a per-netns idx_generator variable,
    instead of a static one.
    Alternative would be to use an atomic variable.

    KVM: x86: Mask LVTPC when handling a PMI
    
    commit a16eb25b09c02a54c1c1b449d4b6cfa2cf3f013a upstream.
    
    Per the SDM, "When the local APIC handles a performance-monitoring
    counters interrupt, it automatically sets the mask flag in the LVT
    performance counter register."  Add this behavior to KVM's local APIC
    emulation.
    
    Failure to mask the LVTPC entry results in spurious PMIs, e.g. when
    running Linux as a guest, PMI handlers that do a "late_ack" spew a large
    number of "dazed and confused" spurious NMI warnings.

    Bluetooth: avoid memcmp() out of bounds warning
    
    commit 9d1a3c74746428102d55371fbf74b484733937d9 upstream.
    
    bacmp() is a wrapper around memcpy(), which contain compile-time
    checks for buffer overflow. Since the hci_conn_request_evt() also calls
    bt_dev_dbg() with an implicit NULL pointer check, the compiler is now
    aware of a case where 'hdev' is NULL and treats this as meaning that
    zero bytes are available:
    
    In file included from net/bluetooth/hci_event.c:32:
    In function 'bacmp',
        inlined from 'hci_conn_request_evt' at net/bluetooth/hci_event.c:3276:7:
    include/net/bluetooth/bluetooth.h:364:16: error: 'memcmp' specified bound 6 exceeds source size 0 [-Werror=stringop-overread]
      364 |         return memcmp(ba1, ba2, sizeof(bdaddr_t));
          |                ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    Add another NULL pointer check before the bacmp() to ensure the compiler
    understands the code flow enough to not warn about it.  Since the patch
    that introduced the warning is marked for stable backports, this one
    should also go that way to avoid introducing build regressions.

    Bluetooth: vhci: Fix race when opening vhci device
    
    commit 92d4abd66f7080075793970fc8f241239e58a9e7 upstream.
    
    When the vhci device is opened in the two-step way, i.e.: open device
    then write a vendor packet with requested controller type, the device
    shall respond with a vendor packet which includes HCI index of created
    interface.
    
    When the virtual HCI is created, the host sends a reset request to the
    controller. This request is processed by the vhci_send_frame() function.
    However, this request is send by a different thread, so it might happen
    that this HCI request will be received before the vendor response is
    queued in the read queue. This results in the HCI vendor response and
    HCI reset request inversion in the read queue which leads to improper
    behavior of btvirt:
    
    > dmesg

    [1754265.043775] Bluetooth: hci1: Opcode 0x c03 failed: -110
    
    In order to synchronize vhci two-step open/setup process with virtual
    HCI initialization, this patch adds internal lock when queuing data in
    the vhci_send_frame() function.

    Bluetooth: Reject connection with the device which has same BD_ADDR
    
    commit 1ffc6f8cc33268731fcf9629fc4438f6db1191fc upstream.
    
    This change is used to relieve CVE-2020-26555. The description of
    the CVE:
    
    Bluetooth legacy BR/EDR PIN code pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification
    1.0B through 5.2 may permit an unauthenticated nearby device to spoof
    the BD_ADDR of the peer device to complete pairing without knowledge
    of the PIN. [1]
    
    The detail of this attack is in IEEE paper:
    BlueMirror: Reflections on Bluetooth Pairing and Provisioning Protocols
    [2]
    
    It's a reflection attack. The paper mentioned that attacker can induce
    the attacked target to generate null link key (zero key) without PIN
    code. In BR/EDR, the key generation is actually handled in the controller
    which is below HCI.
    
    A condition of this attack is that attacker should change the
    BR_ADDR of his hacking device (Host B) to equal to the BR_ADDR with
    the target device being attacked (Host A).
    
    Thus, we reject the connection with device which has same BD_ADDR
    both on HCI_Create_Connection and HCI_Connection_Request to prevent
    the attack. A similar implementation also shows in btstack project.

    usb: hub: Guard against accesses to uninitialized BOS descriptors
    
    commit f74a7afc224acd5e922c7a2e52244d891bbe44ee upstream.
    
    Many functions in drivers/usb/core/hub.c and drivers/usb/core/hub.h
    access fields inside udev->bos without checking if it was allocated and
    initialized. If usb_get_bos_descriptor() fails for whatever
    reason, udev->bos will be NULL and those accesses will result in a
    crash:

    dev_forward_skb: do not scrub skb mark within the same name space
    
    commit ff70202b2d1ad522275c6aadc8c53519b6a22c57 upstream.
    
    The goal is to keep the mark during a bpf_redirect(), like it is done for
    legacy encapsulation / decapsulation, when there is no x-netns.
    This was initially done in commit 213dd74aee76 ("skbuff: Do not scrub skb
    mark within the same name space").
    
    When the call to skb_scrub_packet() was added in dev_forward_skb() (commit
    8b27f27797ca ("skb: allow skb_scrub_packet() to be used by tunnels")), the
    second argument (xnet) was set to true to force a call to skb_orphan(). At
    this time, the mark was always cleanned up by skb_scrub_packet(), whatever
    xnet value was.
    This call to skb_orphan() was removed later in commit
    9c4c325252c5 ("skbuff: preserve sock reference when scrubbing the skb.").
    But this 'true' stayed here without any real reason.
    
    Let's correctly set xnet in ____dev_forward_skb(), this function has access
    to the previous interface and to the new interface.

    x86/alternatives: Disable KASAN in apply_alternatives()
    
    commit d35652a5fc9944784f6f50a5c979518ff8dacf61 upstream.
    
    Fei has reported that KASAN triggers during apply_alternatives() on
    a 5-level paging machine:
    
            BUG: KASAN: out-of-bounds in rcu_is_watching()
            Read of size 4 at addr ff110003ee6419a0 by task swapper/0/0
            ...
            __asan_load4()
            rcu_is_watching()

            text_poke_early()
            apply_alternatives()
            ...
    
    On machines with 5-level paging, cpu_feature_enabled(X86_FEATURE_LA57)
    gets patched. It includes KASAN code, where KASAN_SHADOW_START depends on
    __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT, which is defined with cpu_feature_enabled().
    
    KASAN gets confused when apply_alternatives() patches the
    KASAN_SHADOW_START users. A test patch that makes KASAN_SHADOW_START
    static, by replacing __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT with 56, works around the issue.
    
    Fix it for real by disabling KASAN while the kernel is patching alternatives.

    usb: gadget: ncm: Handle decoding of multiple NTB's in unwrap call
    
    commit 427694cfaafa565a3db5c5ea71df6bc095dca92f upstream.
    
    When NCM is used with hosts like Windows PC, it is observed that there are
    multiple NTB's contained in one usb request giveback. Since the driver
    unwraps the obtained request data assuming only one NTB is present, we
    loose the subsequent NTB's present resulting in data loss.
    
    Fix this by checking the parsed block length with the obtained data
    length in usb request and continue parsing after the last byte of current
    NTB.

    pinctrl: avoid unsafe code pattern in find_pinctrl()
    
    commit c153a4edff6ab01370fcac8e46f9c89cca1060c2 upstream.
    
    The code in find_pinctrl() takes a mutex and traverses a list of pinctrl
    structures. Later the caller bumps up reference count on the found
    structure. Such pattern is not safe as pinctrl that was found may get
    deleted before the caller gets around to increasing the reference count.
    
    Fix this by taking the reference count in find_pinctrl(), while it still
    holds the mutex.

    cgroup: Remove duplicates in cgroup v1 tasks file
    
    commit 1ca0b605150501b7dc59f3016271da4eb3e96fce upstream.
    
    One PID may appear multiple times in a preloaded pidlist.
    (Possibly due to PID recycling but we have reports of the same
    task_struct appearing with different PIDs, thus possibly involving
    transfer of PID via de_thread().)
    
    Because v1 seq_file iterator uses PIDs as position, it leads to
    a message:
    > seq_file: buggy .next function kernfs_seq_next did not update position index
    
    Conservative and quick fix consists of removing duplicates from `tasks`
    file (as opposed to removing pidlists altogether). It doesn't affect
    correctness (it's sufficient to show a PID once), performance impact
    would be hidden by unconditional sorting of the pidlist already in place
    (asymptotically).

    Input: psmouse - fix fast_reconnect function for PS/2 mode
    
    commit e2cb5cc822b6c9ee72c56ce1d81671b22c05406a upstream.
    
    When the SMBus connection is attempted psmouse_smbus_init() sets
    the fast_reconnect pointer to psmouse_smbus_reconnecti(). If SMBus
    initialization fails, elantech_setup_ps2() and synaptics_init_ps2() will
    fallback to PS/2 mode, replacing the psmouse private data. This can cause
    issues on resume, since psmouse_smbus_reconnect() expects to find an
    instance of struct psmouse_smbus_dev in psmouse->private.
    
    The issue was uncovered when in 92e24e0e57f7 ("Input: psmouse - add
    delay when deactivating for SMBus mode") psmouse_smbus_reconnect()
    started attempting to use more of the data structure. The commit was
    since reverted, not because it was at fault, but because there was found
    a better way of doing what it was attempting to do.
    
    Fix the problem by resetting the fast_reconnect pointer in psmouse
    structure in elantech_setup_ps2() and synaptics_init_ps2() when the PS/2
    mode is used.

    Input: powermate - fix use-after-free in powermate_config_complete
    
    commit 5c15c60e7be615f05a45cd905093a54b11f461bc upstream.
    
    syzbot has found a use-after-free bug [1] in the powermate driver. This
    happens when the device is disconnected, which leads to a memory free from
    the powermate_device struct.  When an asynchronous control message
    completes after the kfree and its callback is invoked, the lock does not
    exist anymore and hence the bug.
    
    Use usb_kill_urb() on pm->config to cancel any in-progress requests upon
    device disconnection.

    ceph: fix incorrect revoked caps assert in ceph_fill_file_size()
    
    commit 15c0a870dc44ed14e01efbdd319d232234ee639f upstream.
    
    When truncating the inode the MDS will acquire the xlock for the
    ifile Locker, which will revoke the 'Frwsxl' caps from the clients.
    But when the client just releases and flushes the 'Fw' caps to MDS,
    for exmaple, and once the MDS receives the caps flushing msg it
    just thought the revocation has finished. Then the MDS will continue
    truncating the inode and then issued the truncate notification to
    all the clients. While just before the clients receives the cap
    flushing ack they receive the truncation notification, the clients
    will detecte that the 'issued | dirty' is still holding the 'Fw'
    caps.

    mcb: remove is_added flag from mcb_device struct
    
    commit 0f28ada1fbf0054557cddcdb93ad17f767105208 upstream.
    
    When calling mcb_bus_add_devices(), both mcb devices and the mcb
    bus will attempt to attach a device to a driver because they share
    the same bus_type. This causes an issue when trying to cast the
    container of the device to mcb_device struct using to_mcb_device(),
    leading to a wrong cast when the mcb_bus is added. A crash occurs
    when freing the ida resources as the bus numbering of mcb_bus gets
    confused with the is_added flag on the mcb_device struct.
    
    The only reason for this cast was to keep an is_added flag on the
    mcb_device struct that does not seem necessary. The function
    device_attach() handles already bound devices and the mcb subsystem
    does nothing special with this is_added flag so remove it completely.

    iio: pressure: ms5611: ms5611_prom_is_valid false negative bug
    
    commit fd39d9668f2ce9f4b05ad55e8c8d80c098073e0b upstream.
    
    The ms5611 driver falsely rejects lots of MS5607-02BA03-50 chips
    with "PROM integrity check failed" because it doesn't accept a prom crc
    value of zero as legitimate.
    
    According to the datasheet for this chip (and the manufacturer's
    application note about the PROM CRC), none of the possible values for the
    CRC are excluded - but the current code in ms5611_prom_is_valid() ends with
    
    return crc_orig != 0x0000 && crc == crc_orig
    
    Discussed with the driver author (Tomasz Duszynski) and he indicated that
    at that time (2015) he was dealing with some faulty chip samples which
    returned blank data under some circumstances and/or followed example code
    which indicated CRC zero being bad.
    
    As far as I can tell this exception should not be applied anymore; We've
    got a few hundred custom boards here with this chip where large numbers
    of the prom have a legitimate CRC value 0, and do work fine, but which the
    current driver code wrongly rejects.

    usb: dwc3: Soft reset phy on probe for host
    
    commit 8bea147dfdf823eaa8d3baeccc7aeb041b41944b upstream.
    
    When there's phy initialization, we need to initiate a soft-reset
    sequence. That's done through USBCMD.HCRST in the xHCI driver and its
    initialization, However, the dwc3 driver may modify core configs before
    the soft-reset. This may result in some connection instability. So,
    ensure the phy is ready before the controller updates the GCTL.PRTCAPDIR
    or other settings by issuing phy soft-reset.
    
    Note that some host-mode configurations may not expose device registers
    to initiate the controller soft-reset (via DCTL.CoreSftRst). So we reset
    through GUSB3PIPECTL and GUSB2PHYCFG instead.

    commit 8f8abb863fa5a4cc18955c6a0e17af0ded3e4a76 upstream.
    
    syzbot has found an uninit-value bug triggered by the dm9601 driver [1].
    
    This error happens because the variable res is not updated if the call
    to dm_read_shared_word returns an error. In this particular case -EPROTO
    was returned and res stayed uninitialized.
    
    This can be avoided by checking the return value of dm_read_shared_word
    and propagating the error if the read operation failed.

    usb: xhci: xhci-ring: Use sysdev for mapping bounce buffer
    
    commit 41a43013d2366db5b88b42bbcd8e8f040b6ccf21 upstream.
    
    As mentioned in:
      commit 474ed23a6257 ("xhci: align the last trb before link if it is
    easily splittable.")
    
    A bounce buffer is utilized for ensuring that transfers that span across
    ring segments are aligned to the EP's max packet size.  However, the device
    that is used to map the DMA buffer to is currently using the XHCI HCD,
    which does not carry any DMA operations in certain configrations.
    Migration to using the sysdev entry was introduced for DWC3 based
    implementations where the IOMMU operations are present.
    
    Replace the reference to the controller device to sysdev instead.  This
    allows the bounce buffer to be properly mapped to any implementations that
    have an IOMMU involved.

    workqueue: Override implicit ordered attribute in workqueue_apply_unbound_cpumask()
    
    [ Upstream commit ca10d851b9ad0338c19e8e3089e24d565ebfffd7 ]
    
    Commit 5c0338c68706 ("workqueue: restore WQ_UNBOUND/max_active==1
    to be ordered") enabled implicit ordered attribute to be added to
    WQ_UNBOUND workqueues with max_active of 1. This prevented the changing
    of attributes to these workqueues leading to fix commit 0a94efb5acbb
    ("workqueue: implicit ordered attribute should be overridable").
    
    However, workqueue_apply_unbound_cpumask() was not updated at that time.
    So sysfs changes to wq_unbound_cpumask has no effect on WQ_UNBOUND
    workqueues with implicit ordered attribute. Since not all WQ_UNBOUND
    workqueues are visible on sysfs, we are not able to make all the
    necessary cpumask changes even if we iterates all the workqueue cpumasks
    in sysfs and changing them one by one.
    
    Fix this problem by applying the corresponding change made
    to apply_workqueue_attrs_locked() in the fix commit to
    workqueue_apply_unbound_cpumask().

    xen-netback: use default TX queue size for vifs
    
    [ Upstream commit 66cf7435a26917c0c4d6245ad9137e7606e84fdf ]
    
    Do not set netback interfaces (vifs) default TX queue size to the ring size.
    The TX queue size is not related to the ring size, and using the ring size (32)
    as the queue size can lead to packet drops.  Note the TX side of the vif
    interface in the netback domain is the one receiving packets to be injected
    to the guest.
    
    Do not explicitly set the TX queue length to any value when creating the
    interface, and instead use the system default.  Note that the queue length can
    also be adjusted at runtime.

    [ Upstream commit f990874b1c98fe8e57ee9385669f501822979258 ]
    
    If of_clk_add_provider() fails in ca8210_register_ext_clock(),
    it calls clk_unregister() to release priv->clk and returns an
    error. However, the caller ca8210_probe() then calls ca8210_remove(),
    where priv->clk is freed again in ca8210_unregister_ext_clock(). In
    this case, a use-after-free may happen in the second time we call
    clk_unregister().
    
    Fix this by removing the first clk_unregister(). Also, priv->clk could
    be an error code on failure of clk_register_fixed_rate(). Use
    IS_ERR_OR_NULL to catch this case in ca8210_unregister_ext_clock().

    drm/msm/dsi: skip the wait for video mode done if not applicable
    
    [ Upstream commit ab483e3adcc178254eb1ce0fbdfbea65f86f1006 ]
    
    dsi_wait4video_done() API waits for the DSI video mode engine to
    become idle so that we can transmit the DCS commands in the
    beginning of BLLP. However, with the current sequence, the MDP
    timing engine is turned on after the panel's pre_enable() callback
    which can send out the DCS commands needed to power up the panel.
    
    During those cases, this API will always timeout and print out the
    error spam leading to long bootup times and log flooding.
    
    Fix this by checking if the DSI video engine was actually busy before
    waiting for it to become idle otherwise this is a redundant wait.
    
    changes in v2:
            - move the reg read below the video mode check
            - minor fixes in commit text

    It looks like this was a backporting error for the upstream patch
    963b2e8c428f "drm/etnaviv: fix reference leak when mmaping imported buffer"
    
    In the 5.4 kernel there are 2 variants of the object put function:
            drm_gem_object_put() [which requires lock to be held]
            drm_gem_object_put_unlocked() [which requires lock to be NOT held]
    
    In later kernels [5.14+] this has gone and there just drm_gem_object_put()
    which requires lock to be NOT held.
    
    So the memory leak pach, which added a call to drm_gem_object_put() was correct
    on newer kernels but wrong on 5.4 and earlier ones.
    
    So switch back to using the _unlocked variant for old kernels.
    This should only be applied to the 5.4, 4.19 and 4.14 longterm branches;
    mainline and more recent longterms already have the correct fix.

    overwrite in kernel_connect"), BPF hooks run on bind may rewrite the
    address passed to kernel_bind(). This change
    
    1) Makes a copy of the bind address in kernel_bind() to insulate
       callers.
    2) Replaces direct calls to sock->ops->bind() in net with kernel_bind()

    quota: Fix slow quotaoff
    
    commit 869b6ea1609f655a43251bf41757aa44e5350a8f upstream.
    
    Eric has reported that commit dabc8b207566 ("quota: fix dqput() to
    follow the guarantees dquot_srcu should provide") heavily increases
    runtime of generic/270 xfstest for ext4 in nojournal mode. The reason
    for this is that ext4 in nojournal mode leaves dquots dirty until the last
    dqput() and thus the cleanup done in quota_release_workfn() has to write
    them all. Due to the way quota_release_workfn() is written this results
    in synchronize_srcu() call for each dirty dquot which makes the dquot
    cleanup when turning quotas off extremely slow.
    
    To be able to avoid synchronize_srcu() for each dirty dquot we need to
    rework how we track dquots to be cleaned up. Instead of keeping the last
    dquot reference while it is on releasing_dquots list, we drop it right
    away and mark the dquot with new DQ_RELEASING_B bit instead. This way we
    can we can remove dquot from releasing_dquots list when new reference to
    it is acquired and thus there's no need to call synchronize_srcu() each
    time we drop dq_list_lock.

    HID: logitech-hidpp: Fix kernel crash on receiver USB disconnect
    
    commit dac501397b9d81e4782232c39f94f4307b137452 upstream.
    
    hidpp_connect_event() has *four* time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU)
    races when it races with itself.
    
    hidpp_connect_event() primarily runs from a workqueue but it also runs
    on probe() and if a "device-connected" packet is received by the hw
    when the thread running hidpp_connect_event() from probe() is waiting on
    the hw, then a second thread running hidpp_connect_event() will be
    started from the workqueue.
    
    This opens the following races (note the below code is simplified):
    
    1. Retrieving + printing the protocol (harmless race):
    
            if (!hidpp->protocol_major) {
                    hidpp_root_get_protocol_version()
                    hidpp->protocol_major = response.rap.params[0];
            }
    
    We can actually see this race hit in the dmesg in the abrt output
    attached to rhbz#2227968:
    
    [ 3064.624215] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.
    [ 3064.658184] logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.
    
    Testing with extra logging added has shown that after this the 2 threads
    take turn grabbing the hw access mutex (send_mutex) so they ping-pong
    through all the other TOCTOU cases managing to hit all of them:
    
    2. Updating the name to the HIDPP name (harmless race):
    
            if (hidpp->name == hdev->name) {
                    ...
                    hidpp->name = new_name;
            }
    
    3. Initializing the power_supply class for the battery (problematic!):
    
    hidpp_initialize_battery()
    {
            if (hidpp->battery.ps)
                    return 0;
    
            probe_battery(); /* Blocks, threads take turns executing this */
    
            hidpp->battery.desc.properties =
                    devm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);
    
            hidpp->battery.ps =
                    devm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,
                                               &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);
    }
    
    4. Creating delayed input_device (potentially problematic):
    
            if (hidpp->delayed_input)
                    return;
    
            hidpp->delayed_input = hidpp_allocate_input(hdev);
    
    The really big problem here is 3. Hitting the race leads to the following
    sequence:
    
            hidpp->battery.desc.properties =
                    devm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);
    
            hidpp->battery.ps =
                    devm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,
                                               &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);
    
            ...
    
            hidpp->battery.desc.properties =
                    devm_kmemdup(dev, hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL);
    
            hidpp->battery.ps =
                    devm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev,
                                               &hidpp->battery.desc, cfg);
    
    So now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,
    which looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not even
    the really big problem.
    
    Notice how:
    
    1. This is all devm-maganaged
    2. The hidpp->battery.desc struct is shared between the 2 power supplies
    3. hidpp->battery.desc.properties points to the result from the second
       devm_kmemdup()
    
    This causes a use after free scenario on USB disconnect of the receiver:
    1. The last registered power supply class device gets unregistered
    2. The memory from the last devm_kmemdup() call gets freed,
       hidpp->battery.desc.properties now points to freed memory
    3. The first registered power supply class device gets unregistered,
       this involves sending a remove uevent to userspace which invokes
       power_supply_uevent() to fill the uevent data
    4. power_supply_uevent() uses hidpp->battery.desc.properties which
       now points to freed memory leading to backtraces like this one:

    There have been quite a few bug reports (see Link tags) about this crash.
    
    Fix all the TOCTOU issues, including the really bad power-supply related
    system crash on USB disconnect, by making probe() use the workqueue for
    running hidpp_connect_event() too, so that it can never run more then once.

    net: prevent rewrite of msg_name in sock_sendmsg()
    
    [ Upstream commit 86a7e0b69bd5b812e48a20c66c2161744f3caa16 ]
    
    Callers of sock_sendmsg(), and similarly kernel_sendmsg(), in kernel
    space may observe their value of msg_name change in cases where BPF
    sendmsg hooks rewrite the send address. This has been confirmed to break
    NFS mounts running in UDP mode and has the potential to break other
    systems.
    
    This patch:
    
    1) Creates a new function called __sock_sendmsg() with same logic as the
       old sock_sendmsg() function.
    2) Replaces calls to sock_sendmsg() made by __sys_sendto() and
       __sys_sendmsg() with __sock_sendmsg() to avoid an unnecessary copy,
       as these system calls are already protected.
    3) Modifies sock_sendmsg() so that it makes a copy of msg_name if
       present before passing it down the stack to insulate callers from
       changes to the send address.

    net: fix kernel-doc warnings for socket.c
    
    [ Upstream commit 85806af0c6bac0feb777e255a25fd5d0cf6ad38e ]
    
    Fix kernel-doc warnings by moving the kernel-doc notation to be
    immediately above the functions that it describes.
    
    Fixes these warnings for sock_sendmsg() and sock_recvmsg():

    indirect call wrappers: helpers to speed-up indirect calls of builtin
    
    [ Upstream commit 283c16a2dfd332bf5610c874f7b9f9c8b601ce53 ]
    
    This header define a bunch of helpers that allow avoiding the
    retpoline overhead when calling builtin functions via function pointers.
    It boils down to explicitly comparing the function pointers to
    known builtin functions and eventually invoke directly the latter.
    
    The macros defined here implement the boilerplate for the above schema
    and will be used by the next patches.
    
    rfc -> v1:
     - use branch prediction hint, as suggested by Eric
    v1  -> v2:
     - list explicitly the builtin function names in INDIRECT_CALL_*(),
       as suggested by Ed Cree
