    net: mctp: purge receive queues on sk destruction
    
    commit 60bd1d9008a50cc78c4033a16a6f5d78210d481c upstream.
    
    We may have pending skbs in the receive queue when the sk is being
    destroyed; add a destructor to purge the queue.
    
    MCTP doesn't use the error queue, so only the receive_queue is purged.

    net: fix NULL pointer in skb_segment_list
    
    commit 876e8ca8366735a604bac86ff7e2732fc9d85d2d upstream.
    
    Commit 3a1296a38d0c ("net: Support GRO/GSO fraglist chaining.")
    introduced UDP listifyed GRO. The segmentation relies on frag_list being
    untouched when passing through the network stack. This assumption can be
    broken sometimes, where frag_list itself gets pulled into linear area,
    leaving frag_list being NULL. When this happens it can trigger
    following NULL pointer dereference, and panic the kernel. Reverse the
    test condition should fix it.

    selftests: Provide local define of __cpuid_count()
    
    commit a23039c7306f53416ba35d230201398ea34f4640 upstream.
    
    Some selftests depend on information provided by the CPUID instruction.
    To support this dependency the selftests implement private wrappers for
    CPUID.
    
    Duplication of the CPUID wrappers should be avoided.
    
    Both gcc and clang/LLVM provide __cpuid_count() macros but neither
    the macro nor its header file are available in all the compiler
    versions that need to be supported by the selftests. __cpuid_count()
    as provided by gcc is available starting with gcc v4.4, so it is
    not available if the latest tests need to be run in all the
    environments required to support kernels v4.9 and v4.14 that
    have the minimal required gcc v3.2.
    
    Duplicate gcc's __cpuid_count() macro to provide a centrally defined
    macro for __cpuid_count() to help eliminate the duplicate CPUID wrappers
    while continuing to compile in older environments.

    ACPI: processor idle: Practically limit "Dummy wait" workaround to old Intel systems
    
    commit e400ad8b7e6a1b9102123c6240289a811501f7d9 upstream.
    
    Old, circa 2002 chipsets have a bug: they don't go idle when they are
    supposed to.  So, a workaround was added to slow the CPU down and
    ensure that the CPU waits a bit for the chipset to actually go idle.
    This workaround is ancient and has been in place in some form since
    the original kernel ACPI implementation.
    
    But, this workaround is very painful on modern systems.  The "inl()"
    can take thousands of cycles (see Link: for some more detailed
    numbers and some fun kernel archaeology).
    
    First and foremost, modern systems should not be using this code.
    Typical Intel systems have not used it in over a decade because it is
    horribly inferior to MWAIT-based idle.
    
    Despite this, people do seem to be tripping over this workaround on
    AMD system today.
    
    Limit the "dummy wait" workaround to Intel systems.  Keep Modern AMD
    systems from tripping over the workaround.  Remotely modern Intel
    systems use intel_idle instead of this code and will, in practice,
    remain unaffected by the dummy wait.

    ext4: fix bad checksum after online resize
    
    commit a408f33e895e455f16cf964cb5cd4979b658db7b upstream.
    
    When online resizing is performed twice consecutively, the error message
    "Superblock checksum does not match superblock" is displayed for the
    second time. Here's the reproducer:
    
            mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/sdb 100M
            mount /dev/sdb /tmp/test
            resize2fs /dev/sdb 5G
            resize2fs /dev/sdb 6G
    
    To solve this issue, we moved the update of the checksum after the
    es->s_overhead_clusters is updated.
    
    Fixes: 026d0d27c488 ("ext4: reduce computation of overhead during resize")

    firmware: arm_scmi: Clear stale xfer->hdr.status
    
    [ Upstream commit f6ca5059dc0d6608dc46070f48e396d611f240d6 ]
    
    Stale error status reported from a previous message transaction must be
    cleared before starting a new transaction to avoid being confusingly
    reported in the following SCMI message dump traces.

    arm64: dts: imx8mq-thor96: fix no-mmc property for SDHCI
    
    [ Upstream commit ef10d57936ead5e817ef7cea6a87531085e77773 ]
    
    There is no "no-emmc" property, so intention for SD/SDIO only nodes was
    to use "no-mmc".
