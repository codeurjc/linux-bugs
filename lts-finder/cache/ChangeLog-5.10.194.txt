    rcu-tasks: Add trc_inspect_reader() checks for exiting critical section
    
    commit 18f08e758f34e6dfe0668bee51bd2af7adacf381 upstream.
    
    Currently, trc_inspect_reader() treats a task exiting its RCU Tasks
    Trace read-side critical section the same as being within that critical
    section.  However, this can fail because that task might have already
    checked its .need_qs field, which means that it might never decrement
    the all-important trc_n_readers_need_end counter.  Of course, for that
    to happen, the task would need to never again execute an RCU Tasks Trace
    read-side critical section, but this really could happen if the system's
    last trampoline was removed.  Note that exit from such a critical section
    cannot be treated as a quiescent state due to the possibility of nested
    critical sections.  This means that if trc_inspect_reader() sees a
    negative nesting value, it must set up to try again later.
    
    This commit therefore ignores tasks that are exiting their RCU Tasks
    Trace read-side critical sections so that they will be rechecked later.

    rcu-tasks: Wait for trc_read_check_handler() IPIs
    
    commit cbe0d8d91415c9692fe88191940d98952b6855d9 upstream.
    
    Currently, RCU Tasks Trace initializes the trc_n_readers_need_end counter
    to the value one, increments it before each trc_read_check_handler()
    IPI, then decrements it within trc_read_check_handler() if the target
    task was in a quiescent state (or if the target task moved to some other
    CPU while the IPI was in flight), complaining if the new value was zero.
    The rationale for complaining is that the initial value of one must be
    decremented away before zero can be reached, and this decrement has not
    yet happened.
    
    Except that trc_read_check_handler() is initiated with an asynchronous
    smp_call_function_single(), which might be significantly delayed.  This
    can result in false-positive complaints about the counter reaching zero.
    
    This commit therefore waits for in-flight IPI handlers to complete before
    decrementing away the initial value of one from the trc_n_readers_need_end
    counter.

    rcu-tasks: Fix IPI failure handling in trc_wait_for_one_reader
    
    commit 46aa886c483f57ef13cd5ea0a85e70b93eb1d381 upstream.
    
    The trc_wait_for_one_reader() function is called at multiple stages
    of trace rcu-tasks GP function, rcu_tasks_wait_gp():
    
    - First, it is called as part of per task function -
      rcu_tasks_trace_pertask(), for all non-idle tasks. As part of per task
      processing, this function add the task in the holdout list and if the
      task is currently running on a CPU, it sends IPI to the task's CPU.
      The IPI handler takes action depending on whether task is in trace
      rcu-tasks read side critical section or not:
    
      - a. If the task is in trace rcu-tasks read side critical section
           (t->trc_reader_nesting != 0), the IPI handler sets the task's
           ->trc_reader_special.b.need_qs, so that this task notifies exit
           from its outermost read side critical section (by decrementing
           trc_n_readers_need_end) to the GP handling function.
           trc_wait_for_one_reader() also increments trc_n_readers_need_end,
           so that the trace rcu-tasks GP handler function waits for this
           task's read side exit notification. The IPI handler also sets
           t->trc_reader_checked to true, and no further IPIs are sent for
           this task, for this trace rcu-tasks grace period and this
           task can be removed from holdout list.
    
      - b. If the task is in the process of exiting its trace rcu-tasks
           read side critical section, (t->trc_reader_nesting < 0), defer
           this task's processing to future calls to trc_wait_for_one_reader().
    
      - c. If task is not in rcu-task read side critical section,
           t->trc_reader_nesting == 0, ->trc_reader_checked is set for this
           task, so that this task is removed from holdout list.
    
    - Second, trc_wait_for_one_reader() is called as part of post scan, in
      function rcu_tasks_trace_postscan(), for all idle tasks.
    
    - Third, in function check_all_holdout_tasks_trace(), this function is
      called for each task in the holdout list, but only if there isn't
      a pending IPI for the task (->trc_ipi_to_cpu == -1). This function
      removed the task from holdout list, if IPI handler has completed the
      required work, to ensure that the current trace rcu-tasks grace period
      either waits for this task, or this task is not in a trace rcu-tasks
      read side critical section.
    
    Now, considering the scenario where smp_call_function_single() fails in
    first case, inside rcu_tasks_trace_pertask(). In this case,
    ->trc_ipi_to_cpu is set to the current CPU for that task. This will
    result in trc_wait_for_one_reader() getting skipped in third case,
    inside check_all_holdout_tasks_trace(), for this task. This further
    results in ->trc_reader_checked never getting set for this task,
    and the task not getting removed from holdout list. This can cause
    the current trace rcu-tasks grace period to stall.
    
    Fix the above problem, by resetting ->trc_ipi_to_cpu to -1, on
    smp_call_function_single() failure, so that future IPI calls can
    be send for this task.
    
    Note that all three of the trc_wait_for_one_reader() function's
    callers (rcu_tasks_trace_pertask(), rcu_tasks_trace_postscan(),
    check_all_holdout_tasks_trace()) hold cpu_read_lock().  This means
    that smp_call_function_single() cannot race with CPU hotplug, and thus
    should never fail.  Therefore, also add a warning in order to report
    any such failure in case smp_call_function_single() grows some other
    reason for failure.

    rcu: Prevent expedited GP from enabling tick on offline CPU
    
    commit 147f04b14adde831eb4a0a1e378667429732f9e8 upstream.
    
    If an RCU expedited grace period starts just when a CPU is in the process
    of going offline, so that the outgoing CPU has completed its pass through
    stop-machine but has not yet completed its final dive into the idle loop,
    RCU will attempt to enable that CPU's scheduling-clock tick via a call
    to tick_dep_set_cpu().  For this to happen, that CPU has to have been
    online when the expedited grace period completed its CPU-selection phase.
    
    This is pointless:  The outgoing CPU has interrupts disabled, so it cannot
    take a scheduling-clock tick anyway.  In addition, the tick_dep_set_cpu()
    function's eventual call to irq_work_queue_on() will splat as follows:
    
    smpboot: CPU 1 is now offline

    ARM: module: Use module_init_layout_section() to spot init sections
    
    commit a6846234f45801441f0e31a8b37f901ef0abd2df upstream.
    
    Today module_frob_arch_sections() spots init sections from their
    'init' prefix, and uses this to keep the init PLTs separate from the rest.
    
    get_module_plt() uses within_module_init() to determine if a
    location is in the init text or not, but this depends on whether
    core code thought this was an init section.
    
    Naturally the logic is different.
    
    module_init_layout_section() groups the init and exit text together if
    module unloading is disabled, as the exit code will never run. The result
    is kernels with this configuration can't load all their modules because
    there are not enough PLTs for the combined init+exit section.
    
    A previous patch exposed module_init_layout_section(), use that so the
    logic is the same.

    module: Expose module_init_layout_section()
    
    commit 2abcc4b5a64a65a2d2287ba0be5c2871c1552416 upstream.
    
    module_init_layout_section() choses whether the core module loader
    considers a section as init or not. This affects the placement of the
    exit section when module unloading is disabled. This code will never run,
    so it can be free()d once the module has been initialised.
    
    arm and arm64 need to count the number of PLTs they need before applying
    relocations based on the section name. The init PLTs are stored separately
    so they can be free()d. arm and arm64 both use within_module_init() to
    decide which list of PLTs to use when applying the relocation.
    
    Because within_module_init()'s behaviour changes when module unloading
    is disabled, both architecture would need to take this into account when
    counting the PLTs.
    
    Today neither architecture does this, meaning when module unloading is
    disabled there are insufficient PLTs in the init section to load some
    modules, resulting in warnings:

    Instead of duplicating module_init_layout_section()s logic, expose it.
