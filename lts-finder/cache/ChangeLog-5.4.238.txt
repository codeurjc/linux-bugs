    HID: uhid: Over-ride the default maximum data buffer value with our own
    
    commit 1c5d4221240a233df2440fe75c881465cdf8da07 upstream.
    
    The default maximum data buffer size for this interface is UHID_DATA_MAX
    (4k).  When data buffers are being processed, ensure this value is used
    when ensuring the sanity, rather than a value between the user provided
    value and HID_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE (16k).

    HID: core: Provide new max_buffer_size attribute to over-ride the default
    
    commit b1a37ed00d7908a991c1d0f18a8cba3c2aa99bdc upstream.
    
    Presently, when a report is processed, its proposed size, provided by
    the user of the API (as Report Size * Report Count) is compared against
    the subsystem default HID_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE (16k).  However, some
    low-level HID drivers allocate a reduced amount of memory to their
    buffers (e.g. UHID only allocates UHID_DATA_MAX (4k) buffers), rending
    this check inadequate in some cases.
    
    In these circumstances, if the received report ends up being smaller
    than the proposed report size, the remainder of the buffer is zeroed.
    That is, the space between sizeof(csize) (size of the current report)
    and the rsize (size proposed i.e. Report Size * Report Count), which can
    be handled up to HID_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE (16k).  Meaning that memset()
    shoots straight past the end of the buffer boundary and starts zeroing
    out in-use values, often resulting in calamity.
    
    This patch introduces a new variable into 'struct hid_ll_driver' where
    individual low-level drivers can over-ride the default maximum value of
    HID_MAX_BUFFER_SIZE (16k) with something more sympathetic to the
    interface.

    PCI: Unify delay handling for reset and resume
    
    commit ac91e6980563ed53afadd925fa6585ffd2bc4a2c upstream.
    
    Sheng Bi reports that pci_bridge_secondary_bus_reset() may fail to wait
    for devices on the secondary bus to become accessible after reset:
    
    Although it does call pci_dev_wait(), it erroneously passes the bridge's
    pci_dev rather than that of a child.  The bridge of course is always
    accessible while its secondary bus is reset, so pci_dev_wait() returns
    immediately.
    
    Sheng Bi proposes introducing a new pci_bridge_secondary_bus_wait()
    function which is called from pci_bridge_secondary_bus_reset():
    
    https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20220523171517.32407-1-windy.bi.enflame@gmail.com/
    
    However we already have pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() which does
    almost exactly what we need.  So far it's only called on resume from
    D3cold (which implies a Fundamental Reset per PCIe r6.0 sec 5.8).
    Re-using it for Secondary Bus Resets is a leaner and more rational
    approach than introducing a new function.
    
    That only requires a few minor tweaks:
    
    - Amend pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() to await accessibility of
      the first device on the secondary bus by calling pci_dev_wait() after
      performing the prescribed delays.  pci_dev_wait() needs two parameters,
      a reset reason and a timeout, which callers must now pass to
      pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus().  The timeout is 1 sec for resume
      (PCIe r6.0 sec 6.6.1) and 60 sec for reset (commit 821cdad5c46c ("PCI:
      Wait up to 60 seconds for device to become ready after FLR")).
      Introduce a PCI_RESET_WAIT macro for the 1 sec timeout.
    
    - Amend pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus() to return 0 on success or
      -ENOTTY on error for consumption by pci_bridge_secondary_bus_reset().
    
    - Drop an unnecessary 1 sec delay from pci_reset_secondary_bus() which
      is now performed by pci_bridge_wait_for_secondary_bus().  A static
      delay this long is only necessary for Conventional PCI, so modern
      PCIe systems benefit from shorter reset times as a side effect.

    s390/ipl: add missing intersection check to ipl_report handling
    
    commit a52e5cdbe8016d4e3e6322fd93d71afddb9a5af9 upstream.
    
    The code which handles the ipl report is searching for a free location
    in memory where it could copy the component and certificate entries to.
    It checks for intersection between the sections required for the kernel
    and the component/certificate data area, but fails to check whether
    the data structures linking these data areas together intersect.
    
    This might cause the iplreport copy code to overwrite the iplreport
    itself. Fix this by adding two addtional intersection checks.

    commit 690e0ec8e63da9a29b39fedc6ed5da09c7c82651 upstream.
    
    Direction from hardware is that stolen memory should never be used for

    caching pitfalls due to the way stolen memory accesses are routed. So
    it is safest to just not use it.

    tracing: Make tracepoint lockdep check actually test something
    
    commit c2679254b9c9980d9045f0f722cf093a2b1f7590 upstream.
    
    A while ago where the trace events had the following:
    
       rcu_read_lock_sched_notrace();
       rcu_dereference_sched(...);
       rcu_read_unlock_sched_notrace();
    
    If the tracepoint is enabled, it could trigger RCU issues if called in
    the wrong place. And this warning was only triggered if lockdep was
    enabled. If the tracepoint was never enabled with lockdep, the bug would
    not be caught. To handle this, the above sequence was done when lockdep
    was enabled regardless if the tracepoint was enabled or not (although the
    always enabled code really didn't do anything, it would still trigger a
    warning).
    
    But a lot has changed since that lockdep code was added. One is, that
    sequence no longer triggers any warning. Another is, the tracepoint when
    enabled doesn't even do that sequence anymore.
    
    The main check we care about today is whether RCU is "watching" or not.
    So if lockdep is enabled, always check if rcu_is_watching() which will
    trigger a warning if it is not (tracepoints require RCU to be watching).
    
    Note, that old sequence did add a bit of overhead when lockdep was enabled,
    and with the latest kernel updates, would cause the system to slow down
    enough to trigger kernel "stalled" warnings.

    The function hist_field_name() cannot handle being passed a NULL field

    check the field and add a WARN_ON() if it is NULL.

    a break character by writing 1 to CTRL[SBK], so here need to skip
    waiting for transmission complete when UARTCTRL_SBK is asserted,
    otherwise the kernel may stuck here.
    And actually set_termios() adds transmission completion waiting to avoid
    data loss or data breakage when changing the baud rate, but we don't
    need to worry about this when queuing break characters.

    sh: intc: Avoid spurious sizeof-pointer-div warning
    
    [ Upstream commit 250870824c1cf199b032b1ef889c8e8d69d9123a ]
    
    GCC warns about the pattern sizeof(void*)/sizeof(void), as it looks like
    the abuse of a pattern to calculate the array size. This pattern appears
    in the unevaluated part of the ternary operator in _INTC_ARRAY if the
    parameter is NULL.
    
    The replacement uses an alternate approach to return 0 in case of NULL
    which does not generate the pattern sizeof(void*)/sizeof(void), but still
    emits the warning if _INTC_ARRAY is called with a nonarray parameter.
    
    This patch is required for successful compilation with -Werror enabled.
    
    The idea to use _Generic for type distinction is taken from Comment #7
    in https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=108483 by Jakub Jelinek

    drm/amdkfd: Fix an illegal memory access
    
    [ Upstream commit 4fc8fff378b2f2039f2a666d9f8c570f4e58352c ]
    
    In the kfd_wait_on_events() function, the kfd_event_waiter structure is
    allocated by alloc_event_waiters(), but the event field of the waiter
    structure is not initialized; When copy_from_user() fails in the
    kfd_wait_on_events() function, it will enter exception handling to
    release the previously allocated memory of the waiter structure;
    Due to the event field of the waiters structure being accessed
    in the free_waiters() function, this results in illegal memory access
    and system crash, here is the crash log:

    The problem is that the inode contains an xattr entry with ea_inum of 15
    when cleaning up an orphan inode <15>. When evict inode <15>, the reference
    counting of the corresponding EA inode is decreased. When EA inode <15> is
    found by find_inode_fast() in __ext4_iget(), it is found that the EA inode
    holds the I_FREEING flag and waits for the EA inode to complete deletion.
    As a result, when inode <15> is being deleted, we wait for inode <15> to
    complete the deletion, resulting in an infinite loop and triggering Hung
    Task. To solve this problem, we only need to check whether the ino of EA
    inode and parent is the same before getting EA inode.

    ext4: fail ext4_iget if special inode unallocated
    
    [ Upstream commit 5cd740287ae5e3f9d1c46f5bfe8778972fd6d3fe ]
    
    In ext4_fill_super(), EXT4_ORPHAN_FS flag is cleared after
    ext4_orphan_cleanup() is executed. Therefore, when __ext4_iget() is
    called to get an inode whose i_nlink is 0 when the flag exists, no error
    is returned. If the inode is a special inode, a null pointer dereference
    may occur. If the value of i_nlink is 0 for any inodes (except boot loader
    inodes) got by using the EXT4_IGET_SPECIAL flag, the current file system
    is corrupted. Therefore, make the ext4_iget() function return an error if
    it gets such an abnormal special inode.

    jffs2: correct logic when creating a hole in jffs2_write_begin
    
    [ Upstream commit 23892d383bee15b64f5463bd7195615734bb2415 ]
    
    Bug description and fix:
    
    1. Write data to a file, say all 1s from offset 0 to 16.
    
    2. Truncate the file to a smaller size, say 8 bytes.
    
    3. Write new bytes (say 2s) from an offset past the original size of the
    file, say at offset 20, for 4 bytes.  This is supposed to create a "hole"
    in the file, meaning that the bytes from offset 8 (where it was truncated
    above) up to the new write at offset 20, should all be 0s (zeros).
    
    4. Flush all caches using "echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches" (or unmount
    and remount) the f/s.
    
    5. Check the content of the file.  It is wrong.  The 1s that used to be
    between bytes 9 and 16, before the truncation, have REAPPEARED (they should
    be 0s).
    
    We wrote a script and helper C program to reproduce the bug
    (reproduce_jffs2_write_begin_issue.sh, write_file.c, and Makefile).  We can
    make them available to anyone.
    
    The above example is shown when writing a small file within the same first
    page.  But the bug happens for larger files, as long as steps 1, 2, and 3
    above all happen within the same page.
    
    The problem was traced to the jffs2_write_begin code, where it goes into an
    'if' statement intended to handle writes past the current EOF (i.e., writes
    that may create a hole).  The code computes a 'pageofs' that is the floor
    of the write position (pos), aligned to the page size boundary.  In other
    words, 'pageofs' will never be larger than 'pos'.  The code then sets the
    internal jffs2_raw_inode->isize to the size of max(current inode size,
    pageofs) but that is wrong: the new file size should be the 'pos', which is
    larger than both the current inode size and pageofs.
    
    Similarly, the code incorrectly sets the internal jffs2_raw_inode->dsize to
    the difference between the pageofs minus current inode size; instead it
    should be the current pos minus the current inode size.  Finally,
    inode->i_size was also set incorrectly.
    
    The patch below fixes this bug.  The bug was discovered using a new tool
    for finding f/s bugs using model checking, called MCFS (Model Checking File
    Systems).

    mmc: atmel-mci: fix race between stop command and start of next command
    
    [ Upstream commit eca5bd666b0aa7dc0bca63292e4778968241134e ]
    
    This commit fixes a race between completion of stop command and start of a
    new command.
    Previously the command ready interrupt was enabled before stop command
    was written to the command register. This caused the command ready
    interrupt to fire immediately since the CMDRDY flag is asserted constantly
    while there is no command in progress.
    Consequently the command state machine will immediately advance to the
    next state when the tasklet function is executed again, no matter
    actual completion state of the stop command.
    Thus a new command can then be dispatched immediately, interrupting and
    corrupting the stop command on the CMD line.
    Fix that by dropping the command ready interrupt enable before calling
    atmci_send_stop_cmd. atmci_send_stop_cmd does already enable the
    command ready interrupt, no further writes to ATMCI_IER are necessary.

    media: m5mols: fix off-by-one loop termination error
    
    [ Upstream commit efbcbb12ee99f750c9f25c873b55ad774871de2a ]
    
    The __find_restype() function loops over the m5mols_default_ffmt[]
    array, and the termination condition ends up being wrong: instead of
    stopping when the iterator becomes the size of the array it traverses,
    it stops after it has already overshot the array.
    
    Now, in practice this doesn't likely matter, because the code will
    always find the entry it looks for, and will thus return early and never
    hit that last extra iteration.
    
    But it turns out that clang will unroll the loop fully, because it has
    only two iterations (well, three due to the off-by-one bug), and then
    clang will end up just giving up in the middle of the loop unrolling
    when it notices that the code walks past the end of the array.
    
    And that made 'objtool' very unhappy indeed, because the generated code
    just falls off the edge of the universe, and ends up falling through to
    the next function, causing this warning:
    
       drivers/media/i2c/m5mols/m5mols.o: warning: objtool: m5mols_set_fmt() falls through to next function m5mols_get_frame_desc()
    
    Fix the loop ending condition.

    In xgene_hwmon_probe, &ctx->workq is bound with xgene_hwmon_evt_work.
    Then it will be started.
    
    If we remove the driver which will call xgene_hwmon_remove to clean up,
    there may be unfinished work.
    
    The possible sequence is as follows:
    
    Fix it by finishing the work before cleanup in xgene_hwmon_remove.
    
    CPU0                  CPU1
    
                        |xgene_hwmon_evt_work
    xgene_hwmon_remove   |

    ipv4: Fix incorrect table ID in IOCTL path
    
    [ Upstream commit 8a2618e14f81604a9b6ad305d57e0c8da939cd65 ]
    
    Commit f96a3d74554d ("ipv4: Fix incorrect route flushing when source
    address is deleted") started to take the table ID field in the FIB info
    structure into account when determining if two structures are identical
    or not. This field is initialized using the 'fc_table' field in the
    route configuration structure, which is not set when adding a route via
    IOCTL.
    
    The above can result in user space being able to install two identical
    routes that only differ in the table ID field of their associated FIB
    info.
    
    Fix by initializing the table ID field in the route configuration
    structure in the IOCTL path.
    
    Before the fix:
    
     # ip route add default via 192.0.2.2
     # route add default gw 192.0.2.2
     # ip -4 r show default
     # default via 192.0.2.2 dev dummy10
     # default via 192.0.2.2 dev dummy10
    
    After the fix:
    
     # ip route add default via 192.0.2.2
     # route add default gw 192.0.2.2
     SIOCADDRT: File exists
     # ip -4 r show default
     default via 192.0.2.2 dev dummy10
    
    Audited the code paths to ensure there are no other paths that do not
    properly initialize the route configuration structure when installing a
    route.

    nvmet: avoid potential UAF in nvmet_req_complete()
    
    [ Upstream commit 6173a77b7e9d3e202bdb9897b23f2a8afe7bf286 ]
    
    An nvme target ->queue_response() operation implementation may free the
    request passed as argument. Such implementation potentially could result
    in a use after free of the request pointer when percpu_ref_put() is
    called in nvmet_req_complete().
    
    Avoid such problem by using a local variable to save the sq pointer
    before calling __nvmet_req_complete(), thus avoiding dereferencing the
    req pointer after that function call.

    nfc: st-nci: Fix use after free bug in ndlc_remove due to race condition
    
    [ Upstream commit 5000fe6c27827a61d8250a7e4a1d26c3298ef4f6 ]
    
    This bug influences both st_nci_i2c_remove and st_nci_spi_remove.
    Take st_nci_i2c_remove as an example.
    
    In st_nci_i2c_probe, it called ndlc_probe and bound &ndlc->sm_work
    with llt_ndlc_sm_work.
    
    When it calls ndlc_recv or timeout handler, it will finally call
    schedule_work to start the work.
    
    When we call st_nci_i2c_remove to remove the driver, there
    may be a sequence as follows:
    
    Fix it by finishing the work before cleanup in ndlc_remove
    
    CPU0                  CPU1
    
                        |llt_ndlc_sm_work

    net: tunnels: annotate lockless accesses to dev->needed_headroom
    
    [ Upstream commit 4b397c06cb987935b1b097336532aa6b4210e091 ]
    
    IP tunnels can apparently update dev->needed_headroom
    in their xmit path.
    
    This patch takes care of three tunnels xmit, and also the
    core LL_RESERVED_SPACE() and LL_RESERVED_SPACE_EXTRA()
    helpers.
    
    More changes might be needed for completeness.

    qed/qed_dev: guard against a possible division by zero
    
    [ Upstream commit 1a9dc5610ef89d807acdcfbff93a558f341a44da ]
    
    Previously we would divide total_left_rate by zero if num_vports
    happened to be 1 because non_requested_count is calculated as
    num_vports - req_count. Guard against this by validating num_vports at
    the beginning and returning an error otherwise.
    
    Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with the SVACE
    static analysis tool.

    i40e: Fix kernel crash during reboot when adapter is in recovery mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 7e4f8a0c495413a50413e8c9f1032ce1bc633bae ]
    
    If the driver detects during probe that firmware is in recovery
    mode then i40e_init_recovery_mode() is called and the rest of
    probe function is skipped including pci_set_drvdata(). Subsequent
    i40e_shutdown() called during shutdown/reboot dereferences NULL
    pointer as pci_get_drvdata() returns NULL.
    
    To fix call pci_set_drvdata() also during entering to recovery mode.
    
    Reproducer:
    1) Lets have i40e NIC with firmware in recovery mode
    2) Run reboot

    ipvlan: Make skb->skb_iif track skb->dev for l3s mode
    
    [ Upstream commit 59a0b022aa249e3f5735d93de0849341722c4754 ]
    
    For l3s mode, skb->dev is set to ipvlan interface in ipvlan_nf_input():
      skb->dev = addr->master->dev
    but, skb->skb_iif remain unchanged, this will cause socket lookup failed
    if a target socket is bound to a interface, like the following example:
    
      ip link add ipvlan0 link eth0 type ipvlan mode l3s
      ip addr add dev ipvlan0 192.168.124.111/24
      ip link set ipvlan0 up
    
      ping -c 1 -I ipvlan0 8.8.8.8
      100% packet loss
    
    This is because there is no match sk in __raw_v4_lookup() as sk->sk_bound_dev_if != dif(skb->skb_iif).
    Fix this by make skb->skb_iif track skb->dev in ipvlan_nf_input().

    REGMAP is a hidden (not user visible) symbol. Users cannot set it
    directly thru "make *config", so drivers should select it instead of
    depending on it if they need it.
    
    Consistently using "select" or "depends on" can also help reduce
    Kconfig circular dependency issues.
    
    Therefore, change the use of "depends on REGMAP" to "select REGMAP".

    line on the bottom of the scaled overlay. Comparing with the downstream
    vendor driver revealed VPP_DUMMY_DATA not being set [0].
    
    Setting VPP_DUMMY_DATA prevents the 1px pink line from being seen.

    cifs: Move the in_send statistic to __smb_send_rqst()
    
    [ Upstream commit d0dc41119905f740e8d5594adce277f7c0de8c92 ]
    
    When send SMB_COM_NT_CANCEL and RFC1002_SESSION_REQUEST, the
    in_send statistic was lost.
    
    Let's move the in_send statistic to the send function to avoid
    this scenario.

    drm/panfrost: Don't sync rpm suspension after mmu flushing
    
    [ Upstream commit ba3be66f11c3c49afaa9f49b99e21d88756229ef ]
    
    Lockdep warns about potential circular locking dependency of devfreq
    with the fs_reclaim caused by immediate device suspension when mapping is
    released by shrinker. Fix it by doing the suspension asynchronously.

    xfrm: Allow transport-mode states with AF_UNSPEC selector
    
    [ Upstream commit c276a706ea1f51cf9723ed8484feceaf961b8f89 ]
    
    xfrm state selectors are matched against the inner-most flow
    which can be of any address family.  Therefore middle states
    in nested configurations need to carry a wildcard selector in
    order to work at all.
    
    However, this is currently forbidden for transport-mode states.
    
    Fix this by removing the unnecessary check.

    ext4: fix cgroup writeback accounting with fs-layer encryption
    
    commit ffec85d53d0f39ee4680a2cf0795255e000e1feb upstream.
    
    When writing a page from an encrypted file that is using
    filesystem-layer encryption (not inline encryption), ext4 encrypts the
    pagecache page into a bounce page, then writes the bounce page.
    
    It also passes the bounce page to wbc_account_cgroup_owner().  That's
    incorrect, because the bounce page is a newly allocated temporary page
    that doesn't have the memory cgroup of the original pagecache page.
    This makes wbc_account_cgroup_owner() not account the I/O to the owner
    of the pagecache page as it should.
    
    Fix this by always passing the pagecache page to
    wbc_account_cgroup_owner().
