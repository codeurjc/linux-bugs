    btrfs: raid56: don't trust any cached sector in __raid56_parity_recover()
    
    commit f6065f8edeb25f4a9dfe0b446030ad995a84a088 upstream.
    
    [BUG]
    There is a small workload which will always fail with recent kernel:
    (A simplified version from btrfs/125 test case)
    
      mkfs.btrfs -f -m raid5 -d raid5 -b 1G $dev1 $dev2 $dev3
      mount $dev1 $mnt
      xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xee 0 1M" $mnt/file1
      sync
      umount $mnt
      btrfs dev scan -u $dev3
      mount -o degraded $dev1 $mnt
      xfs_io -f -c "pwrite -S 0xff 0 128M" $mnt/file2
      umount $mnt
      btrfs dev scan
      mount $dev1 $mnt
      btrfs balance start --full-balance $mnt
      umount $mnt
    
    The failure is always failed to read some tree blocks:
    
      BTRFS info (device dm-4): relocating block group 217710592 flags data|raid5
      BTRFS error (device dm-4): parent transid verify failed on 38993920 wanted 9 found 7
      BTRFS error (device dm-4): parent transid verify failed on 38993920 wanted 9 found 7
      ...
    
    [CAUSE]
    With the recently added debug output, we can see all RAID56 operations
    related to full stripe 38928384:
    
      56.1183: raid56_read_partial: full_stripe=38928384 devid=2 type=DATA1 offset=0 opf=0x0 physical=9502720 len=65536

      56.1189: raid56_write_stripe: full_stripe=38928384 devid=1 type=PQ1 offset=32768 opf=0x1 physical=30507008 len=16384
      56.1218: raid56_write_stripe: full_stripe=38928384 devid=3 type=DATA2 offset=49152 opf=0x1 physical=9551872 len=16384
      56.1219: raid56_write_stripe: full_stripe=38928384 devid=1 type=PQ1 offset=49152 opf=0x1 physical=30523392 len=16384
      56.2721: raid56_parity_recover: full stripe=38928384 eb=39010304 mirror=2
      56.2723: raid56_parity_recover: full stripe=38928384 eb=39010304 mirror=2
      56.2724: raid56_parity_recover: full stripe=38928384 eb=39010304 mirror=2
    
    Before we enter raid56_parity_recover(), we have triggered some metadata
    write for the full stripe 38928384, this leads to us to read all the
    sectors from disk.
    
    Furthermore, btrfs raid56 write will cache its calculated P/Q sectors to
    avoid unnecessary read.
    
    This means, for that full stripe, after any partial write, we will have
    stale data, along with P/Q calculated using that stale data.
    
    Thankfully due to patch "btrfs: only write the sectors in the vertical stripe
    which has data stripes" we haven't submitted all the corrupted P/Q to disk.
    
    When we really need to recover certain range, aka in
    raid56_parity_recover(), we will use the cached rbio, along with its
    cached sectors (the full stripe is all cached).
    
    This explains why we have no event raid56_scrub_read_recover()
    triggered.
    
    Since we have the cached P/Q which is calculated using the stale data,
    the recovered one will just be stale.
    
    In our particular test case, it will always return the same incorrect
    metadata, thus causing the same error message "parent transid verify
    failed on 39010304 wanted 9 found 7" again and again.
    
    [BTRFS DESTRUCTIVE RMW PROBLEM]
    
    Test case btrfs/125 (and above workload) always has its trouble with
    the destructive read-modify-write (RMW) cycle:
    
            0       32K     64K
    Data1:  | Good  | Good  |
    Data2:  | Bad   | Bad   |
    Parity: | Good  | Good  |
    
    In above case, if we trigger any write into Data1, we will use the bad
    data in Data2 to re-generate parity, killing the only chance to recovery
    Data2, thus Data2 is lost forever.
    
    This destructive RMW cycle is not specific to btrfs RAID56, but there
    are some btrfs specific behaviors making the case even worse:
    
    - Btrfs will cache sectors for unrelated vertical stripes.
    
      In above example, if we're only writing into 0~32K range, btrfs will
      still read data range (32K ~ 64K) of Data1, and (64K~128K) of Data2.
      This behavior is to cache sectors for later update.
    
      Incidentally commit d4e28d9b5f04 ("btrfs: raid56: make steal_rbio()
      subpage compatible") has a bug which makes RAID56 to never trust the
      cached sectors, thus slightly improve the situation for recovery.
    
      Unfortunately, follow up fix "btrfs: update stripe_sectors::uptodate in
      steal_rbio" will revert the behavior back to the old one.
    
    - Btrfs raid56 partial write will update all P/Q sectors and cache them
    
      This means, even if data at (64K ~ 96K) of Data2 is free space, and
      only (96K ~ 128K) of Data2 is really stale data.
      And we write into that (96K ~ 128K), we will update all the parity
      sectors for the full stripe.
    
      This unnecessary behavior will completely kill the chance of recovery.
    
      Thankfully, an unrelated optimization "btrfs: only write the sectors
      in the vertical stripe which has data stripes" will prevent
      submitting the write bio for untouched vertical sectors.
    
      That optimization will keep the on-disk P/Q untouched for a chance for
      later recovery.
    
    [FIX]
    Although we have no good way to completely fix the destructive RMW
    (unless we go full scrub for each partial write), we can still limit the
    damage.
    
    With patch "btrfs: only write the sectors in the vertical stripe which
    has data stripes" now we won't really submit the P/Q of unrelated
    vertical stripes, so the on-disk P/Q should still be fine.
    
    Now we really need to do is just drop all the cached sectors when doing
    recovery.
    
    By this, we have a chance to read the original P/Q from disk, and have a
    chance to recover the stale data, while still keep the cache to speed up
    regular write path.
    
    In fact, just dropping all the cache for recovery path is good enough to
    allow the test case btrfs/125 along with the small script to pass
    reliably.
    
    The lack of metadata write after the degraded mount, and forced metadata
    COW is saving us this time.
    
    So this patch will fix the behavior by not trust any cache in
    __raid56_parity_recover(), to solve the problem while still keep the
    cache useful.
    
    But please note that this test pass DOES NOT mean we have solved the
    destructive RMW problem, we just do better damage control a little
    better.

    btrfs: only write the sectors in the vertical stripe which has data stripes
    
    commit bd8f7e627703ca5707833d623efcd43f104c7b3f upstream.
    
    If we have only 8K partial write at the beginning of a full RAID56
    stripe, we will write the following contents:
    
                        0  8K           32K             64K
    Disk 1  (data):     |XX|            |               |
    Disk 2  (data):     |               |               |
    Disk 3  (parity):   |XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX|
    
    |X| means the sector will be written back to disk.
    
    Note that, although we won't write any sectors from disk 2, but we will
    write the full 64KiB of parity to disk.
    
    This behavior is fine for now, but not for the future (especially for
    RAID56J, as we waste quite some space to journal the unused parity
    stripes).
    
    So here we will also utilize the btrfs_raid_bio::dbitmap, anytime we
    queue a higher level bio into an rbio, we will update rbio::dbitmap to
    indicate which vertical stripes we need to writeback.
    
    And at finish_rmw(), we also check dbitmap to see if we need to write
    any sector in the vertical stripe.
    
    So after the patch, above example will only lead to the following
    writeback pattern:
    
                        0  8K           32K             64K
    Disk 1  (data):     |XX|            |               |
    Disk 2  (data):     |               |               |
    Disk 3  (parity):   |XX|            |               |

    tracing/probes: Have kprobes and uprobes use $COMM too
    
    commit ab8384442ee512fc0fc72deeb036110843d0e7ff upstream.
    
    Both $comm and $COMM can be used to get current->comm in eprobes and the
    filtering and histogram logic. Make kprobes and uprobes consistent in this
    regard and allow both $comm and $COMM as well. Currently kprobes and
    uprobes only handle $comm, which is inconsistent with the other utilities,
    and can be confusing to users.

    tee: add overflow check in register_shm_helper()
    
    commit 573ae4f13f630d6660008f1974c0a8a29c30e18a upstream.
    
    With special lengths supplied by user space, register_shm_helper() has
    an integer overflow when calculating the number of pages covered by a
    supplied user space memory region.
    
    This causes internal_get_user_pages_fast() a helper function of

    [ Upstream commit 74de14fe05dd6b151d73cb0c73c8ec874cbdcde6 ]
    
    When CONFIG_XPA is enabled, Clang warns:

      2 errors generated.
    
    _PAGE_NO_EXEC can be '0' or '1 << _PAGE_NO_EXEC_SHIFT' depending on the
    build and runtime configuration, which is what the negation operators
    are trying to convey. To silence the warning, explicitly compare against
    0 so the result of the '<<' operator is not implicitly converted to a
    boolean.
    
    According to its documentation, GCC enables -Wint-in-bool-context with
    -Wall but this warning is not visible when building the same
    configuration with GCC. It appears GCC only warns when compiling C++,
    not C, although the documentation makes no note of this:

    smb3: check xattr value length earlier
    
    [ Upstream commit 5fa2cffba0b82336a2244d941322eb1627ff787b ]
    
    Coverity complains about assigning a pointer based on
    value length before checking that value length goes
    beyond the end of the SMB.  Although this is even more
    unlikely as value length is a single byte, and the
    pointer is not dereferenced until laterm, it is clearer
    to check the lengths first.

    ALSA: core: Add async signal helpers
    
    [ Upstream commit ef34a0ae7a2654bc9e58675e36898217fb2799d8 ]
    
    Currently the call of kill_fasync() from an interrupt handler might
    lead to potential spin deadlocks, as spotted by syzkaller.
    Unfortunately, it's not so trivial to fix this lock chain as it's
    involved with the tasklist_lock that is touched in allover places.
    
    As a temporary workaround, this patch provides the way to defer the
    async signal notification in a work.  The new helper functions,
    snd_fasync_helper() and snd_kill_faync() are replacements for
    fasync_helper() and kill_fasync(), respectively.  In addition,
    snd_fasync_free() needs to be called at the destructor of the relevant
    file object.

    watchdog: export lockup_detector_reconfigure
    
    [ Upstream commit 7c56a8733d0a2a4be2438a7512566e5ce552fccf ]
    
    In some circumstances it may be interesting to reconfigure the watchdog
    from inside the kernel.
    
    On PowerPC, this may helpful before and after a LPAR migration (LPM) is
    initiated, because it implies some latencies, watchdog, and especially NMI
    watchdog is expected to be triggered during this operation. Reconfiguring
    the watchdog with a factor, would prevent it to happen too frequently
    during LPM.
    
    Rename lockup_detector_reconfigure() as __lockup_detector_reconfigure() and
    create a new function lockup_detector_reconfigure() calling
    __lockup_detector_reconfigure() under the protection of watchdog_mutex.

    This patch avoids an attempt to resize the filesystem to an
    unaligned cluster boundary.  An online resize to a size that is not
    integral to cluster size results in the last iteration attempting to
    grow the fs by a negative amount, which trips a BUG_ON and leaves the fs

    It's not allowed to quit remove early without cleaning up completely.
    Otherwise this results in resource leaks that probably yield graver
    problems later. Here for example some tasklets might survive the lifetime
    of the sprd-dma device and access sdev which is freed after .remove()
    returns.
    
    As none of the device freeing requires an active device, just ignore the
    return value of pm_runtime_get_sync().

    The Broadcom BCM5750x NICs may be multi-function devices.  They do not
    advertise ACS capability. Peer-to-peer transactions are not possible
    between the individual functions, so it is safe to treat them as fully
    isolated.
    
    Add an ACS quirk for these devices so the functions can be in independent
    IOMMU groups and attached individually to userspace applications using
    VFIO.

    locking/atomic: Make test_and_*_bit() ordered on failure
    
    commit 415d832497098030241605c52ea83d4e2cfa7879 upstream.
    
    These operations are documented as always ordered in
    include/asm-generic/bitops/instrumented-atomic.h, and producer-consumer
    type use cases where one side needs to ensure a flag is left pending
    after some shared data was updated rely on this ordering, even in the
    failure case.
    
    This is the case with the workqueue code, which currently suffers from a
    reproducible ordering violation on Apple M1 platforms (which are
    notoriously out-of-order) that ends up causing the TTY layer to fail to
    deliver data to userspace properly under the right conditions.  This
    change fixes that bug.
    
    Change the documentation to restrict the "no order on failure" story to
    the _lock() variant (for which it makes sense), and remove the
    early-exit from the generic implementation, which is what causes the
    missing barrier semantics in that case.  Without this, the remaining
    atomic op is fully ordered (including on ARM64 LSE, as of recent
    versions of the architecture spec).

    gcc-plugins: Undefine LATENT_ENTROPY_PLUGIN when plugin disabled for a file
    
    commit 012e8d2034f1bda8863435cd589636e618d6a659 upstream.
    
    Commit 36d4b36b6959 ("lib/nodemask: inline next_node_in() and
    node_random()") refactored some code by moving node_random() from
    lib/nodemask.c to include/linux/nodemask.h, thus requiring nodemask.h to
    include random.h, which conditionally defines add_latent_entropy()
    depending on whether the macro LATENT_ENTROPY_PLUGIN is defined.
    
    This broke the build on powerpc, where nodemask.h is indirectly included
    in arch/powerpc/kernel/prom_init.c, part of the early boot machinery that
    is excluded from the latent entropy plugin using
    DISABLE_LATENT_ENTROPY_PLUGIN. It turns out that while we add a gcc flag
    to disable the actual plugin, we don't undefine LATENT_ENTROPY_PLUGIN.
    
    This leads to the following:

    igb: Add lock to avoid data race
    
    commit 6faee3d4ee8be0f0367d0c3d826afb3571b7a5e0 upstream.
    
    The commit c23d92b80e0b ("igb: Teardown SR-IOV before
    unregister_netdev()") places the unregister_netdev() call after the
    igb_disable_sriov() call to avoid functionality issue.
    
    However, it introduces several race conditions when detaching a device.
    For example, when .remove() is called, the below interleaving leads to
    use-after-free.
    
     (FREE from device detaching)      |   (USE from netdev core)
    igb_remove                         |  igb_ndo_get_vf_config
     igb_disable_sriov                 |  vf >= adapter->vfs_allocated_count?
      kfree(adapter->vf_data)          |
      adapter->vfs_allocated_count = 0 |
                                       |    memcpy(... adapter->vf_data[vf]
    
    Moreover, the igb_disable_sriov() also suffers from data race with the
    requests from VF driver.
    
     (FREE from device detaching)      |   (USE from requests)
    igb_remove                         |  igb_msix_other
     igb_disable_sriov                 |   igb_msg_task
      kfree(adapter->vf_data)          |    vf < adapter->vfs_allocated_count
      adapter->vfs_allocated_count = 0 |
    
    To this end, this commit first eliminates the data races from netdev
    core by using rtnl_lock (similar to commit 719479230893 ("dpaa2-eth: add
    MAC/PHY support through phylink")). And then adds a spinlock to
    eliminate races from driver requests. (similar to commit 1e53834ce541
    ("ixgbe: Add locking to prevent panic when setting sriov_numvfs to zero")

    i40e: Fix to stop tx_timeout recovery if GLOBR fails
    
    commit 57c942bc3bef0970f0b21f8e0998e76a900ea80d upstream.
    
    When a tx_timeout fires, the PF attempts to recover by incrementally
    resetting.  First we try a PFR, then CORER and finally a GLOBR.  If the
    GLOBR fails, then we keep hitting the tx_timeout and incrementing the
    recovery level and issuing dmesgs, which is both annoying to the user
    and accomplishes nothing.
    
    If the GLOBR fails, then we're pretty much totally hosed, and there's
    not much else we can do to recover, so this makes it such that we just
    kill the VSI and stop hitting the tx_timeout in such a case.

    This is because pcibios_alloc_controller() holds hose_spinlock but
    of_alias_get_id() takes of_mutex which can sleep.
    
    The hose_spinlock protects the phb_bitmap, and also the hose_list, but
    it doesn't need to be held while get_phb_number() calls the OF routines,
    because those are only looking up information in the device tree.
    
    So fix it by having get_phb_number() take the hose_spinlock itself, only
    where required, and then dropping the lock before returning.
    pcibios_alloc_controller() then needs to take the lock again before the
    list_add() but that's safe, the order of the list is not important.

    nios2: add force_successful_syscall_return()
    
    commit fd0c153daad135d0ec1a53c5dbe6936a724d6ae1 upstream.
    
    If we use the ancient SysV syscall ABI, we'd better have tell the
    kernel how to claim that a negative return value is a success.
    Use ->orig_r2 for that - it's inaccessible via ptrace, so it's
    a fair game for changes and it's normally[*] non-negative on return
    from syscall.  Set to -1; syscall is not going to be restart-worthy
    by definition, so we won't interfere with that use either.
    
    [*] the only exception is rt_sigreturn(), where we skip the entire
    messing with r1/r2 anyway.

    atm: idt77252: fix use-after-free bugs caused by tst_timer
    
    commit 3f4093e2bf4673f218c0bf17d8362337c400e77b upstream.
    
    There are use-after-free bugs caused by tst_timer. The root cause
    is that there are no functions to stop tst_timer in idt77252_exit().
    One of the possible race conditions is shown below:
    
        (thread 1)          |        (thread 2)
                            |  idt77252_init_one
                            |    init_card
                            |      fill_tst
                            |        mod_timer(&card->tst_timer, ...)
    idt77252_exit           |  (wait a time)
                            |  tst_timer
                            |
                            |    ...
      kfree(card) // FREE   |
                            |    card->soft_tst[e] // USE
    
    The idt77252_dev is deallocated in idt77252_exit() and used in
    timer handler.
    
    This patch adds del_timer_sync() in idt77252_exit() in order that
    the timer handler could be stopped before the idt77252_dev is
    deallocated.

    xen/xenbus: fix return type in xenbus_file_read()
    
    commit 32ad11127b95236dfc52375f3707853194a7f4b4 upstream.
    
    This code tries to store -EFAULT in an unsigned int.  The
    xenbus_file_read() function returns type ssize_t so the negative value
    is returned as a positive value to the user.
    
    This change forces another change to the min() macro.  Originally, the
    min() macro used "unsigned" type which checkpatch complains about.  Also
    unsigned type would break if "len" were not capped at MAX_RW_COUNT.  Use
    size_t for the min().  (No effect on runtime for the min_t() change).

    NTB: ntb_tool: uninitialized heap data in tool_fn_write()
    
    commit 45e1058b77feade4e36402828bfe3e0d3363177b upstream.
    
    The call to:
    
            ret = simple_write_to_buffer(buf, size, offp, ubuf, size);
    
    will return success if it is able to write even one byte to "buf".
    The value of "*offp" controls which byte.  This could result in
    reading uninitialized data when we do the sscanf() on the next line.
    
    This code is not really desigined to handle partial writes where
    *offp is non-zero and the "buf" is preserved and re-used between writes.
    Just ban partial writes and replace the simple_write_to_buffer() with
    copy_from_user().

    vsock: Set socket state back to SS_UNCONNECTED in vsock_connect_timeout()
    
    commit a3e7b29e30854ed67be0d17687e744ad0c769c4b upstream.
    
    Imagine two non-blocking vsock_connect() requests on the same socket.
    The first request schedules @connect_work, and after it times out,
    vsock_connect_timeout() sets *sock* state back to TCP_CLOSE, but keeps
    *socket* state as SS_CONNECTING.
    
    Later, the second request returns -EALREADY, meaning the socket "already
    has a pending connection in progress", even though the first request has
    already timed out.
    
    As suggested by Stefano, fix it by setting *socket* state back to
    SS_UNCONNECTED, so that the second request will return -ETIMEDOUT.

    vsock: Fix memory leak in vsock_connect()
    
    commit 7e97cfed9929eaabc41829c395eb0d1350fccb9d upstream.
    
    An O_NONBLOCK vsock_connect() request may try to reschedule
    @connect_work.  Imagine the following sequence of vsock_connect()
    requests:
    
      1. The 1st, non-blocking request schedules @connect_work, which will
         expire after 200 jiffies.  Socket state is now SS_CONNECTING;
    
      2. Later, the 2nd, blocking request gets interrupted by a signal after
         a few jiffies while waiting for the connection to be established.
         Socket state is back to SS_UNCONNECTED, but @connect_work is still
         pending, and will expire after 100 jiffies.
    
      3. Now, the 3rd, non-blocking request tries to schedule @connect_work
         again.  Since @connect_work is already scheduled,
         schedule_delayed_work() silently returns.  sock_hold() is called
         twice, but sock_put() will only be called once in
         vsock_connect_timeout(), causing a memory leak reported by syzbot:

    geneve: do not use RT_TOS for IPv6 flowlabel
    
    commit ca2bb69514a8bc7f83914122f0d596371352416c upstream.
    
    According to Guillaume Nault RT_TOS should never be used for IPv6.
    
    Quote:
    RT_TOS() is an old macro used to interprete IPv4 TOS as described in
    the obsolete RFC 1349. It's conceptually wrong to use it even in IPv4
    code, although, given the current state of the code, most of the
    existing calls have no consequence.
    
    But using RT_TOS() in IPv6 code is always a bug: IPv6 never had a "TOS"
    field to be interpreted the RFC 1349 way. There's no historical
    compatibility to worry about.

    commit e35a5e782f67ed76a65ad0f23a484444a95f000f upstream.
    
    A client should be able to handle getting an EACCES error while doing
    a mount operation to reclaim state due to NFS4CLNT_RECLAIM_REBOOT
    being set. If the server returns RPC_AUTH_BADCRED because authentication
    failed when we execute "exportfs -au", then RECLAIM_COMPLETE will go a
    wrong way. After mount succeeds, all OPEN call will fail due to an
    NFS4ERR_GRACE error being returned. This patch is to fix it by resending
    a RPC request.

    NFSv4: Fix races in the legacy idmapper upcall
    
    commit 51fd2eb52c0ca8275a906eed81878ef50ae94eb0 upstream.
    
    nfs_idmap_instantiate() will cause the process that is waiting in
    request_key_with_auxdata() to wake up and exit. If there is a second
    process waiting for the idmap->idmap_mutex, then it may wake up and
    start a new call to request_key_with_auxdata(). If the call to
    idmap_pipe_downcall() from the first process has not yet finished
    calling nfs_idmap_complete_pipe_upcall_locked(), then we may end up
    triggering the WARN_ON_ONCE() in nfs_idmap_prepare_pipe_upcall().
    
    The fix is to ensure that we clear idmap->idmap_upcall_data before
    calling nfs_idmap_instantiate().

    apparmor: fix absroot causing audited secids to begin with =
    
    commit 511f7b5b835726e844a5fc7444c18e4b8672edfd upstream.
    
    AppArmor is prefixing secids that are converted to secctx with the =
    to indicate the secctx should only be parsed from an absolute root
    POV. This allows catching errors where secctx are reparsed back into
    internal labels.
    
    Unfortunately because audit is using secid to secctx conversion this
    means that subject and object labels can result in a very unfortunate
    == that can break audit parsing.
    
    eg. the subj==unconfined term in the below audit message
    
    type=USER_LOGIN msg=audit(1639443365.233:160): pid=1633 uid=0 auid=1000
    ses=3 subj==unconfined msg='op=login id=1000 exe="/usr/sbin/sshd"
    hostname=192.168.122.1 addr=192.168.122.1 terminal=/dev/pts/1 res=success'
    
    Fix this by switch the prepending of = to a _. This still works as a
    special character to flag this case without breaking audit. Also move
    this check behind debug as it should not be needed during normal
    operqation.

    apparmor: fix quiet_denied for file rules
    
    commit 68ff8540cc9e4ab557065b3f635c1ff4c96e1f1c upstream.
    
    Global quieting of denied AppArmor generated file events is not
    handled correctly. Unfortunately the is checking if quieting of all
    audit events is set instead of just denied events.

    can: ems_usb: fix clang's -Wunaligned-access warning
    
    commit a4cb6e62ea4d36e53fb3c0f18ea4503d7b76674f upstream.
    
    clang emits a -Wunaligned-access warning on struct __packed
    ems_cpc_msg.
    
    The reason is that the anonymous union msg (not declared as packed) is
    being packed right after some non naturally aligned variables (3*8
    bits + 2*32) inside a packed struct:
    
    | struct __packed ems_cpc_msg {
    |       u8 type;        /* type of message */
    |       u8 length;      /* length of data within union 'msg' */
    |       u8 msgid;       /* confirmation handle */
    |       __le32 ts_sec;  /* timestamp in seconds */
    |       __le32 ts_nsec; /* timestamp in nano seconds */
    |       /* ^ not naturally aligned */
    |
    |       union {
    |       /* ^ not declared as packed */
    |               u8 generic[64];
    |               struct cpc_can_msg can_msg;
    |               struct cpc_can_params can_params;
    |               struct cpc_confirm confirmation;
    |               struct cpc_overrun overrun;
    |               struct cpc_can_error error;
    |               struct cpc_can_err_counter err_counter;
    |               u8 can_state;
    |       } msg;
    | };
    
    Starting from LLVM 14, having an unpacked struct nested in a packed
    struct triggers a warning. c.f. [1].
    
    Fix the warning by marking the anonymous union as packed.

    btrfs: fix lost error handling when looking up extended ref on log replay
    
    commit 7a6b75b79902e47f46328b57733f2604774fa2d9 upstream.
    
    During log replay, when processing inode references, if we get an error
    when looking up for an extended reference at __add_inode_ref(), we ignore
    it and proceed, returning success (0) if no other error happens after the
    lookup. This is obviously wrong because in case an extended reference
    exists and it encodes some name not in the log, we need to unlink it,
    otherwise the filesystem state will not match the state it had after the
    last fsync.
    
    So just make __add_inode_ref() return an error it gets from the extended
    reference lookup.

    The functions clear_bit and set_bit do not imply a memory barrier, thus it
    may be possible that the waitqueue_active function (which does not take

    ALSA: info: Fix llseek return value when using callback
    
    commit 9be080edcca330be4af06b19916c35227891e8bc upstream.
    
    When using callback there was a flow of
    
            ret = -EINVAL
            if (callback) {
                    offset = callback();

            ...
            offset = some other value in case of no callback;
            ret = offset;
    out:
            return ret;
    
    which causes the snd_info_entry_llseek() to return -EINVAL when there is
    callback handler. Fix this by setting "ret" directly to callback return
    value before jumping to "out".

    powerpc/ptdump: Fix display of RW pages on FSL_BOOK3E
    
    commit dd8de84b57b02ba9c1fe530a6d916c0853f136bd upstream.
    
    On FSL_BOOK3E, _PAGE_RW is defined with two bits, one for user and one
    for supervisor. As soon as one of the two bits is set, the page has
    to be display as RW. But the way it is implemented today requires both
    bits to be set in order to display it as RW.
    
    Instead of display RW when _PAGE_RW bits are set and R otherwise,
    reverse the logic and display R when _PAGE_RW bits are all 0 and
    RW otherwise.
    
    This change has no impact on other platforms as _PAGE_RW is a single
    bit on all of them.

    When scpi probe fails, at any point, we need to ensure that the scpi_info
    is not set and will remain NULL until the probe succeeds. If it is not
    taken care, then it could result use-after-free as the value is exported
    via get_scpi_ops() and could refer to a memory allocated via devm_kzalloc()
    but freed when the probe fails.

    net/9p: Initialize the iounit field during fid creation
    
    commit aa7aeee169480e98cf41d83c01290a37e569be6d upstream.
    
    Ensure that the fid's iounit field is set to zero when a new fid is
    created. Certain 9P operations, such as OPEN and CREATE, allow the
    server to reply with an iounit size which the client code assigns to the
    p9_fid struct shortly after the fid is created by p9_fid_create(). On
    the other hand, an XATTRWALK operation doesn't allow for the server to
    specify an iounit value. The iounit field of the newly allocated p9_fid
    struct remained uninitialized in that case. Depending on allocation
    patterns, the iounit value could have been something reasonable that was
    carried over from previously freed fids or, in the worst case, could
    have been arbitrary values from non-fid related usages of the memory
    location.
    
    The bug was detected in the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) kernel
    after the uninitialized iounit field resulted in the typical sequence of
    two getxattr(2) syscalls, one to get the size of an xattr and another
    after allocating a sufficiently sized buffer to fit the xattr value, to
    hit an unexpected ERANGE error in the second call to getxattr(2). An
    uninitialized iounit field would sometimes force rsize to be smaller
    than the xattr value size in p9_client_read_once() and the 9P server in
    WSL refused to chunk up the READ on the attr_fid and, instead, returned
    ERANGE to the client. The virtfs server in QEMU seems happy to chunk up
    the READ and this problem goes undetected there.

    Revert "net: usb: ax88179_178a needs FLAG_SEND_ZLP"
    
    commit 6fd2c17fb6e02a8c0ab51df1cfec82ce96b8e83d upstream.
    
    This reverts commit 36a15e1cb134c0395261ba1940762703f778438c.
    
    The usage of FLAG_SEND_ZLP causes problems to other firmware/hardware
    versions that have no issues.
    
    The FLAG_SEND_ZLP is not safe to use in this context.
    See:
    https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/patch/1270599787.8900.8.camel@Linuxdev4-laptop/#118378
    The original problem needs another way to solve.

    scsi: sg: Allow waiting for commands to complete on removed device
    
    commit 3455607fd7be10b449f5135c00dc306b85dc0d21 upstream.
    
    When a SCSI device is removed while in active use, currently sg will
    immediately return -ENODEV on any attempt to wait for active commands that
    were sent before the removal.  This is problematic for commands that use
    SG_FLAG_DIRECT_IO since the data buffer may still be in use by the kernel
    when userspace frees or reuses it after getting ENODEV, leading to
    corrupted userspace memory (in the case of READ-type commands) or corrupted
    data being sent to the device (in the case of WRITE-type commands).  This
    has been seen in practice when logging out of a iscsi_tcp session, where
    the iSCSI driver may still be processing commands after the device has been
    marked for removal.
    
    Change the policy to allow userspace to wait for active sg commands even
    when the device is being removed.  Return -ENODEV only when there are no
    more responses to read.

    tcp: fix over estimation in sk_forced_mem_schedule()
    
    commit c4ee118561a0f74442439b7b5b486db1ac1ddfeb upstream.
    
    sk_forced_mem_schedule() has a bug similar to ones fixed
    in commit 7c80b038d23e ("net: fix sk_wmem_schedule() and
    sk_rmem_schedule() errors")
    
    While this bug has little chance to trigger in old kernels,
    we need to fix it before the following patch.

    KVM: x86: Check lapic_in_kernel() before attempting to set a SynIC irq
    
    commit 7ec37d1cbe17d8189d9562178d8b29167fe1c31a upstream
    
    When KVM_CAP_HYPERV_SYNIC{,2} is activated, KVM already checks for
    irqchip_in_kernel() so normally SynIC irqs should never be set. It is,
    however,  possible for a misbehaving VMM to write to SYNIC/STIMER MSRs
    causing erroneous behavior.
    
    The immediate issue being fixed is that kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic()
    (kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic_fast()) crashes when called with
    'irq.shorthand = APIC_DEST_SELF' and 'src == NULL'.

    btrfs: reject log replay if there is unsupported RO compat flag
    
    commit dc4d31684974d140250f3ee612c3f0cab13b3146 upstream.
    
    [BUG]
    If we have a btrfs image with dirty log, along with an unsupported RO
    compatible flag:
    
    log_root                30474240
    ...
    compat_flags            0x0
    compat_ro_flags         0x40000003
                            ( FREE_SPACE_TREE |
                              FREE_SPACE_TREE_VALID |
                              unknown flag: 0x40000000 )
    
    Then even if we can only mount it RO, we will still cause metadata
    update for log replay:
    
      BTRFS info (device dm-1): flagging fs with big metadata feature
      BTRFS info (device dm-1): using free space tree
      BTRFS info (device dm-1): has skinny extents
      BTRFS info (device dm-1): start tree-log replay
    
    This is definitely against RO compact flag requirement.
    
    [CAUSE]
    RO compact flag only forces us to do RO mount, but we will still do log
    replay for plain RO mount.
    
    Thus this will result us to do log replay and update metadata.
    
    This can be very problematic for new RO compat flag, for example older
    kernel can not understand v2 cache, and if we allow metadata update on
    RO mount and invalidate/corrupt v2 cache.
    
    [FIX]
    Just reject the mount unless rescue=nologreplay is provided:
    
      BTRFS error (device dm-1): cannot replay dirty log with unsupport optional features (0x40000000), try rescue=nologreplay instead
    
    We don't want to set rescue=nologreply directly, as this would make the
    end user to read the old data, and cause confusion.
    
    Since the such case is really rare, we're mostly fine to just reject the
    mount with an error message, which also includes the proper workaround.

    net_sched: cls_route: remove from list when handle is 0
    
    commit 9ad36309e2719a884f946678e0296be10f0bb4c1 upstream.
    
    When a route filter is replaced and the old filter has a 0 handle, the old
    one won't be removed from the hashtable, while it will still be freed.
    
    The test was there since before commit 1109c00547fc ("net: sched: RCU
    cls_route"), when a new filter was not allocated when there was an old one.
    The old filter was reused and the reinserting would only be necessary if an
    old filter was replaced. That was still wrong for the same case where the
    old handle was 0.
    
    Remove the old filter from the list independently from its handle value.
    
    This fixes CVE-2022-2588, also reported as ZDI-CAN-17440.

    ACPI: CPPC: Do not prevent CPPC from working in the future
    
    commit 4f4179fcf420873002035cf1941d844c9e0e7cb3 upstream.
    
    There is a problem with the current revision checks in
    is_cppc_supported() that they essentially prevent the CPPC support
    from working if a new _CPC package format revision being a proper
    superset of the v3 and only causing _CPC to return a package with more
    entries (while retaining the types and meaning of the entries defined by
    the v3) is introduced in the future and used by the platform firmware.
    
    In that case, as long as the number of entries in the _CPC return
    package is at least CPPC_V3_NUM_ENT, it should be perfectly fine to
    use the v3 support code and disregard the additional package entries
    added by the new package format revision.
    
    For this reason, drop is_cppc_supported() altogether, put the revision
    checks directly into acpi_cppc_processor_probe() so they are easier to
    follow and rework them to take the case mentioned above into account.

    dm writecache: set a default MAX_WRITEBACK_JOBS
    
    commit ca7dc242e358e46d963b32f9d9dd829785a9e957 upstream.
    
    dm-writecache has the capability to limit the number of writeback jobs
    in progress. However, this feature was off by default. As such there
    were some out-of-memory crashes observed when lowering the low
    watermark while the cache is full.
    
    This commit enables writeback limit by default. It is set to 256MiB or
    1/16 of total system memory, whichever is smaller.

    dm raid: fix address sanitizer warning in raid_status
    
    commit 1fbeea217d8f297fe0e0956a1516d14ba97d0396 upstream.
    
    There is this warning when using a kernel with the address sanitizer
    and running this testsuite:
    https://gitlab.com/cki-project/kernel-tests/-/tree/main/storage/swraid/scsi_raid
    
    ==================================================================

     do_syscall_64+0x5b/0x80
    
    The warning is caused by reading conf->max_nr_stripes in raid_status. The
    code in raid_status reads mddev->private, casts it to struct r5conf and
    reads the entry max_nr_stripes.
    
    However, if we have different raid type than 4/5/6, mddev->private
    doesn't point to struct r5conf; it may point to struct r0conf, struct
    r1conf, struct r10conf or struct mpconf. If we cast a pointer to one
    of these structs to struct r5conf, we will be reading invalid memory
    and KASAN warns about it.
    
    Fix this bug by reading struct r5conf only if raid type is 4, 5 or 6.

    There is a KASAN warning in raid_resume when running the lvm test
    lvconvert-raid.sh. The reason for the warning is that mddev->raid_disks
    is greater than rs->raid_disks, so the loop touches one entry beyond
    the allocated length.

    commit c9fd167d57133c5b748d16913c4eabc55e531c73 upstream.
    
    If the ext4 inode does not have xattr space, 0 is returned in the
    get_max_inline_xattr_value_size function. Otherwise, the function returns
    a negative value when the inode does not contain EXT4_STATE_XATTR.

    ext4: fix extent status tree race in writeback error recovery path
    
    commit 7f0d8e1d607c1a4fa9a27362a108921d82230874 upstream.
    
    A race can occur in the unlikely event ext4 is unable to allocate a
    physical cluster for a delayed allocation in a bigalloc file system
    during writeback.  Failure to allocate a cluster forces error recovery
    that includes a call to mpage_release_unused_pages().  That function
    removes any corresponding delayed allocated blocks from the extent
    status tree.  If a new delayed write is in progress on the same cluster
    simultaneously, resulting in the addition of an new extent containing
    one or more blocks in that cluster to the extent status tree, delayed
    block accounting can be thrown off if that delayed write then encounters
    a similar cluster allocation failure during future writeback.
    
    Write lock the i_data_sem in mpage_release_unused_pages() to fix this
    problem.  Ext4's block/cluster accounting code for bigalloc relies on
    i_data_sem for mutual exclusion, as is found in the delayed write path,
    and the locking in mpage_release_unused_pages() is missing.

    ext4: update s_overhead_clusters in the superblock during an on-line resize
    
    commit de394a86658ffe4e89e5328fd4993abfe41b7435 upstream.
    
    When doing an online resize, the on-disk superblock on-disk wasn't
    updated.  This means that when the file system is unmounted and
    remounted, and the on-disk overhead value is non-zero, this would
    result in the results of statfs(2) to be incorrect.
    
    This was partially fixed by Commits 10b01ee92df5 ("ext4: fix overhead
    calculation to account for the reserved gdt blocks"), 85d825dbf489
    ("ext4: force overhead calculation if the s_overhead_cluster makes no
    sense"), and eb7054212eac ("ext4: update the cached overhead value in
    the superblock").
    
    However, since it was too expensive to forcibly recalculate the
    overhead for bigalloc file systems at every mount, this didn't fix the
    problem for bigalloc file systems.  This commit should address the
    problem when resizing file systems with the bigalloc feature enabled.

    ==================================================================
    
    Above issue may happen as follows:
    -------------------------------------
    ext4_xattr_set
      ext4_xattr_set_handle
        ext4_xattr_ibody_find
          >> s->end < s->base
          >> no EXT4_STATE_XATTR
          >> xattr_check_inode is not executed
        ext4_xattr_ibody_set
          ext4_xattr_set_entry
           >> size_t min_offs = s->end - s->base
           >> UAF in memcpy
    
    we can easily reproduce this problem with the following commands:
        mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/sda
        mount -o debug_want_extra_isize=128 /dev/sda /mnt
        touch /mnt/file
        setfattr -n user.cat -v `seq -s z 4096|tr -d '[:digit:]'` /mnt/file
    
    In ext4_xattr_ibody_find, we have the following assignment logic:
      header = IHDR(inode, raw_inode)
             = raw_inode + EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE + i_extra_isize
      is->s.base = IFIRST(header)
                 = header + sizeof(struct ext4_xattr_ibody_header)
      is->s.end = raw_inode + s_inode_size
    
    In ext4_xattr_set_entry
      min_offs = s->end - s->base
               = s_inode_size - EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE - i_extra_isize -
                 sizeof(struct ext4_xattr_ibody_header)
      last = s->first
      free = min_offs - ((void *)last - s->base) - sizeof(__u32)
           = s_inode_size - EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE - i_extra_isize -
             sizeof(struct ext4_xattr_ibody_header) - sizeof(__u32)
    
    In the calculation formula, all values except s_inode_size and
    i_extra_size are fixed values. When i_extra_size is the maximum value
    s_inode_size - EXT4_GOOD_OLD_INODE_SIZE, min_offs is -4 and free is -8.
    The value overflows. As a result, the preceding issue is triggered when
    memcpy is executed.
    
    Therefore, when finding xattr or setting xattr, check whether
    there is space for storing xattr in the inode to resolve this issue.

    commit b8a04fe77ef1360fbf73c80fddbdfeaa9407ed1b upstream.
    
    ext4_append() must always allocate a new block, otherwise we run the
    risk of overwriting existing directory block corrupting the directory
    tree in the process resulting in all manner of problems later on.
    
    Add a sanity check to see if the logical block is already allocated and

    commit 179b14152dcb6a24c3415200603aebca70ff13af upstream.
    
    When adding an xattr to an inode, we must ensure that the inode_size is

    the end position may be greater than the start position, resulting in UAF.

    spmi: trace: fix stack-out-of-bound access in SPMI tracing functions
    
    commit 2af28b241eea816e6f7668d1954f15894b45d7e3 upstream.
    
    trace_spmi_write_begin() and trace_spmi_read_end() both call
    memcpy() with a length of "len + 1".  This leads to one extra
    byte being read beyond the end of the specified buffer.  Fix
    this out-of-bound memory access by using a length of "len"
    instead.

    to silence the warnings.

    scsi: zfcp: Fix missing auto port scan and thus missing target ports
    
    commit 4da8c5f76825269f28d6a89fa752934a4bcb6dfa upstream.
    
    Case (1):
      The only waiter on wka_port->completion_wq is zfcp_fc_wka_port_get()
      trying to open a WKA port. As such it should only be woken up by WKA port
      *open* responses, not by WKA port close responses.
    
    Case (2):
      A close WKA port response coming in just after having sent a new open WKA
      port request and before blocking for the open response with wait_event()
      in zfcp_fc_wka_port_get() erroneously renders the wait_event a NOP
      because the close handler overwrites wka_port->status. Hence the
      wait_event condition is erroneously true and it does not enter blocking
      state.
    
    With non-negligible probability, the following time space sequence happens
    depending on timing without this fix:

    So we erroneously end up with no automatic port scan. This is a big problem
    when it happens during boot. The timing is influenced by v3.19 commit
    18f87a67e6d6 ("zfcp: auto port scan resiliency").
    
    Fix it by fully mutually excluding zfcp_fc_wka_port_get() and
    zfcp_fc_wka_port_offline(). For that to work, we make the latter block
    until we got the response for a close WKA port. In order not to penalize
    the system workqueue, we move wka_port->work to our own adapter workqueue.
    Note that before v2.6.30 commit 828bc1212a68 ("[SCSI] zfcp: Set WKA-port to
    offline on adapter deactivation"), zfcp did block in
    zfcp_fc_wka_port_offline() as well, but with a different condition.
    
    While at it, make non-functional cleanups to improve code reading in
    zfcp_fc_wka_port_get(). If we cannot send the WKA port open request, don't
    rely on the subsequent wait_event condition to immediately let this case
    pass without blocking. Also don't want to rely on the additional condition
    handling the refcount to be skipped just to finally return with -EIO.

    x86/numa: Use cpumask_available instead of hardcoded NULL check
    
    [ Upstream commit 625395c4a0f4775e0fe00f616888d2e6c1ba49db ]
    
    GCC-12 started triggering a new warning:
    
      arch/x86/mm/numa.c: In function ‘cpumask_of_node’:
      arch/x86/mm/numa.c:916:39: warning: the comparison will always evaluate as ‘false’ for the address of ‘node_to_cpumask_map’ will never be NULL [-Waddress]

    node_to_cpumask_map is of type cpumask_var_t[].
    
    When CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is set, cpumask_var_t is typedef'd to a
    pointer for dynamic allocation, else to an array of one element. The
    "wicked game" can be checked on line 700 of include/linux/cpumask.h.
    
    The original code in debug_cpumask_set_cpu() and cpumask_of_node() were
    probably written by the original authors with CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK=y
    (i.e. dynamic allocation) in mind, checking if the cpumask was available
    via a direct NULL check.
    
    When CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is not set, GCC gives the above warning
    while compiling the kernel.
    
    Fix that by using cpumask_available(), which does the NULL check when
    CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is set, otherwise returns true. Use it wherever
    such checks are made.
    
    Conditional definitions of cpumask_available() can be found along with
    the definition of cpumask_var_t. Check the cpumask.h reference mentioned
    above.

    rather than ET_EXEC.  Check for both when determining whether the object
    is vmlinux.
    
    Modules and vmlinux.o have type ET_REL on all arches.

    powerpc/pci: Fix PHB numbering when using opal-phbid
    
    [ Upstream commit f4b39e88b42d13366b831270306326b5c20971ca ]
    
    The recent change to the PHB numbering logic has a logic error in the
    handling of "ibm,opal-phbid".
    
    When an "ibm,opal-phbid" property is present, &prop is written to and
    ret is set to zero.
    
    The following call to of_alias_get_id() is skipped because ret == 0.
    
    But then the if (ret >= 0) is true, and the body of that if statement
    sets prop = ret which throws away the value that was just read from
    "ibm,opal-phbid".
    
    Fix the logic by only doing the ret >= 0 check in the of_alias_get_id()
    case.

    kprobes: Forbid probing on trampoline and BPF code areas
    
    [ Upstream commit 28f6c37a2910f565b4f5960df52b2eccae28c891 ]
    
    kernel_text_address() treats ftrace_trampoline, kprobe_insn_slot
    and bpf_text_address as valid kprobe addresses - which is not ideal.
    
    These text areas are removable and changeable without any notification
    to kprobes, and probing on them can trigger unexpected behavior:
    
      https://lkml.org/lkml/2022/7/26/1148
    
    Considering that jump_label and static_call text are already
    forbiden to probe, kernel_text_address() should be replaced with
    core_kernel_text() and is_module_text_address() to check other text
    areas which are unsafe to kprobe.

    powerpc/pci: Prefer PCI domain assignment via DT 'linux,pci-domain' and alias
    
    [ Upstream commit 0fe1e96fef0a5c53b4c0d1500d356f3906000f81 ]
    
    Other Linux architectures use DT property 'linux,pci-domain' for
    specifying fixed PCI domain of PCI controller specified in Device-Tree.
    
    And lot of Freescale powerpc boards have defined numbered pci alias in
    Device-Tree for every PCIe controller which number specify preferred PCI
    domain.
    
    So prefer usage of DT property 'linux,pci-domain' (via function
    of_get_pci_domain_nr()) and DT pci alias (via function
    of_alias_get_id()) on powerpc architecture for assigning PCI domain to
    PCI controller.

    powerpc/32: Do not allow selection of e5500 or e6500 CPUs on PPC32
    
    [ Upstream commit 9be013b2a9ecb29b5168e4b9db0e48ed53acf37c ]
    
    Commit 0e00a8c9fd92 ("powerpc: Allow CPU selection also on PPC32")
    enlarged the CPU selection logic to PPC32 by removing depend to
    PPC64, and failed to restrict that depend to E5500_CPU and E6500_CPU.
    Fortunately that got unnoticed because -mcpu=8540 will override the
    -mcpu=e500mc64 or -mpcu=e6500 as they are ealier, but that's
    fragile and may no be right in the future.
    
    Add back the depend PPC64 on E5500_CPU and E6500_CPU.

    The kfifo_to_user() macro is supposed to return zero for success or

    returns unsigned int.  This only affects callers which try to save the

    vfio/ccw: Do not change FSM state in subchannel event

    The routine vfio_ccw_sch_event() is tasked with handling subchannel events,
    specifically machine checks, on behalf of vfio-ccw. It correctly calls
    cio_update_schib(), and if that fails (meaning the subchannel is gone)
    it makes an FSM event call to mark the subchannel Not Operational.
    
    If that worked, however, then it decides that if the FSM state was already
    Not Operational (implying the subchannel just came back), then it should
    simply change the FSM to partially- or fully-open.
    
    Remove this trickery, since a subchannel returning will require more
    probing than simply "oh all is well again" to ensure it works correctly.

    remoteproc: qcom: wcnss: Fix handling of IRQs
    
    [ Upstream commit bed0adac1ded4cb486ba19a3a7e730fbd9a1c9c6 ]
    
    The wcnss_get_irq function is expected to return a value > 0 in the
    event that an IRQ is succssfully obtained, but it instead returns 0.
    This causes the stop and ready IRQs to never actually be used despite
    being defined in the device-tree. This patch fixes that.

    [ Upstream commit 32dd59f96924f45e33bc79854f7a00679c0fa28e ]
    
    The function may be used by the user directly and also by the n_gsm
    internal functions. They can lead into a race condition which results in
    interleaved frames if both are writing at the same time. The receiving side
    is not able to decode those interleaved frames correctly.
    
    Add a lock around the low side tty write to avoid race conditions and frame
    interleaving between user originated writes and n_gsm writes.

    In the current implementation control packets are re-transmitted even if
    the control channel closed down during T2. This is wrong.
    Check whether the control channel is open before re-transmitting any

    and remains unaffected by this.

    tty: n_gsm: fix non flow control frames during mux flow off
    
    [ Upstream commit bec0224816d19abe4fe503586d16d51890540615 ]
    
    n_gsm is based on the 3GPP 07.010 and its newer version is the 3GPP 27.010.
    See https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=1516
    The changes from 07.010 to 27.010 are non-functional. Therefore, I refer to
    the newer 27.010 here. Chapter 5.4.6.3.6 states that FCoff stops the
    transmission on all channels except the control channel. This is already
    implemented in gsm_data_kick(). However, chapter 5.4.8.1 explains that this
    shall result in the same behavior as software flow control on the ldisc in
    advanced option mode. That means only flow control frames shall be sent
    during flow off. The current implementation does not consider this case.
    
    Change gsm_data_kick() to send only flow control frames if constipated to
    abide the standard. gsm_read_ea_val() and gsm_is_flow_ctrl_msg() are
    introduced as helper functions for this.
    It is planned to use gsm_read_ea_val() in later code cleanups for other
    functions, too.

    profiling: fix shift too large makes kernel panic
    
    [ Upstream commit 0fe6ee8f123a4dfb529a5aff07536bb481f34043 ]
    
    2d186afd04d6 ("profiling: fix shift-out-of-bounds bugs") limits shift
    value by [0, BITS_PER_LONG -1], which means [0, 63].
    
    However, syzbot found that the max shift value should be the bit number of
    (_etext - _stext).  If shift is outside of this, the "buffer_bytes" will
    be zero and will cause kzalloc(0).  Then the kernel panics due to
    dereferencing the returned pointer 16.
    
    This can be easily reproduced by passing a large number like 60 to enable
    profiling and then run readprofile.

    Make sure LSR flags are preserved in dw8250_tx_wait_empty(). This
    function is called from a low-level out function and therefore cannot
    call serial_lsr_in() as it would lead to infinite recursion.
    
    It is borderline if the flags need to be saved here at all since this
    code relates to writing LCR register which usually implies no important
    characters should be arriving.

    In the function rxe_create_qp(), rxe_qp_from_init() is called to
    initialize qp, internally things like the spin locks are not setup until
    rxe_qp_init_req().
    
    If an error occures before this point then the unwind will call
    rxe_cleanup() and eventually to rxe_qp_do_cleanup()/rxe_cleanup_task()
    which will oops when trying to access the uninitialized spinlock.

    platform/olpc: Fix uninitialized data in debugfs write
    
    [ Upstream commit 40ec787e1adf302c11668d4cc69838f4d584187d ]
    
    The call to:
    
            size = simple_write_to_buffer(cmdbuf, sizeof(cmdbuf), ppos, buf, size);
    
    will succeed if at least one byte is written to the "cmdbuf" buffer.
    The "*ppos" value controls which byte is written.  Another problem is
    that this code does not check for errors so it's possible for the entire
    buffer to be uninitialized.
    
    Inintialize the struct to zero to prevent reading uninitialized stack
    data.
    
    Debugfs is normally only writable by root so the impact of this bug is
    very minimal.

    'qe_add_gpiochips()' of src file 'drivers\soc\fsl\qe\gpio.c'. In this
    function, of_mm_gpiochip_add_data() is contained in an iteration of
    for_each_compatible_node() which will automatically increase and
    decrease the refcount. So we need additional of_node_get() for the

    scsi: smartpqi: Fix DMA direction for RAID requests
    
    [ Upstream commit 69695aeaa6621bc49cdd7a8e5a8d1042461e496e ]
    
    Correct a SOP READ and WRITE DMA flags for some requests.
    
    This update corrects DMA direction issues with SCSI commands removed from
    the controller's internal lookup table.
    
    Currently, SCSI READ BLOCK LIMITS (0x5) was removed from the controller
    lookup table and exposed a DMA direction flag issue.
    
    SCSI READ BLOCK LIMITS was recently removed from our controller lookup
    table so the controller uses the respective IU flag field to set the DMA
    data direction. Since the DMA direction is incorrect the FW never completes
    the request causing a hang.
    
    Some SCSI commands which use SCSI READ BLOCK LIMITS
    
          * sg_map
          * mt -f /dev/stX status
    
    After updating controller firmware, users may notice their tape units
    failing. This patch resolves the issue.
    
    Also, the AIO path DMA direction is correct.
    
    The DMA direction flag is a day-one bug with no reported BZ.

    [ Upstream commit 6a0c054930d554ad8f8044ef1fc856d9da391c81 ]
    
    There are sleep in atomic context bugs when dm_fsync_timer_callback is
    executing. The root cause is that the memory allocation functions with
    GFP_KERNEL or GFP_NOIO parameters are called in dm_fsync_timer_callback
    which is a timer handler. The call paths that could trigger bugs are
    shown below:
    
        (interrupt context)
    dm_fsync_timer_callback

    soundwire: bus_type: fix remove and shutdown support
    
    [ Upstream commit df6407782964dc7e35ad84230abb38f46314b245 ]
    
    The bus sdw_drv_remove() and sdw_drv_shutdown() helpers are used
    conditionally, if the driver provides these routines.
    
    These helpers already test if the driver provides a .remove or
    .shutdown callback, so there's no harm in invoking the
    sdw_drv_remove() and sdw_drv_shutdown() unconditionally.
    
    In addition, the current code is imbalanced with
    dev_pm_domain_attach() called from sdw_drv_probe(), but
    dev_pm_domain_detach() called from sdw_drv_remove() only if the driver
    provides a .remove callback.

    mtd: sm_ftl: Fix deadlock caused by cancel_work_sync in sm_release
    
    [ Upstream commit a61528d997619a518ee8c51cf0ef0513021afaff ]
    
    There is a deadlock between sm_release and sm_cache_flush_work
    which is a work item. The cancel_work_sync in sm_release will
    not return until sm_cache_flush_work is finished. If we hold
    mutex_lock and use cancel_work_sync to wait the work item to
    finish, the work item also requires mutex_lock. As a result,
    the sm_release will be blocked forever. The race condition is
    shown below:
    
        (Thread 1)             |   (Thread 2)
    sm_release                 |
      mutex_lock(&ftl->mutex)  | sm_cache_flush_work
                               |   mutex_lock(&ftl->mutex)
      cancel_work_sync         |   ...
    
    This patch moves del_timer_sync and cancel_work_sync out of
    mutex_lock in order to mitigate deadlock.

    [ Upstream commit a41b17ff9dacd22f5f118ee53d82da0f3e52d5e3 ]
    
    In the case of sk->dccps_qpolicy == DCCPQ_POLICY_PRIO, dccp_qpolicy_full
    will drop a skb when qpolicy is full. And the lock in dccp_sendmsg is
    released before sock_alloc_send_skb and then relocked after
    sock_alloc_send_skb. The following conditions may lead dccp_qpolicy_push
    to add skb to an already full sk_write_queue:
    
    thread1--->lock
    thread1--->dccp_qpolicy_full: queue is full. drop a skb
    thread1--->unlock
    thread2--->lock
    thread2--->dccp_qpolicy_full: queue is not full. no need to drop.

    thread2--->lock

    This patch solves the issue, by making sure each socket referring to
    a netdevice holds a reference count on it, and properly releases it
    in rose_release().
    
    rose_dev_first() is also fixed to take a device reference
    before leaving the rcu_read_locked section.
    
    Following patch will add ref_tracker annotations to ease

    i2c: cadence: Support PEC for SMBus block read
    
    [ Upstream commit 9fdf6d97f03035ad5298e2d1635036c74c2090ed ]
    
    SMBus packet error checking (PEC) is implemented by appending one
    additional byte of checksum data at the end of the message. This provides
    additional protection and allows to detect data corruption on the I2C bus.
    
    SMBus block reads support variable length reads. The first byte in the read
    message is the number of available data bytes.
    
    The combination of PEC and block read is currently not supported by the
    Cadence I2C driver.
     * When PEC is enabled the maximum transfer length for block reads
       increases from 33 to 34 bytes.
     * The I2C core smbus emulation layer relies on the driver updating the
       `i2c_msg` `len` field with the number of received bytes. The updated
       length is used when checking the PEC.
    
    Add support to the Cadence I2C driver for handling SMBus block reads with
    PEC. To determine the maximum transfer length uses the initial `len` value
    of the `i2c_msg`. When PEC is enabled this will be 2, when it is disabled
    it will be 1.
    
    Once a read transfer is done also increment the `len` field by the amount
    of received data bytes.
    
    This change has been tested with a UCM90320 PMBus power monitor, which
    requires block reads to access certain data fields, but also has PEC
    enabled by default.

    can: error: specify the values of data[5..7] of CAN error frames
    
    [ Upstream commit e70a3263a7eed768d5f947b8f2aff8d2a79c9d97 ]
    
    Currently, data[5..7] of struct can_frame, when used as a CAN error
    frame, are defined as being "controller specific". Device specific
    behaviours are problematic because it prevents someone from writing
    code which is portable between devices.
    
    As a matter of fact, data[5] is never used, data[6] is always used to
    report TX error counter and data[7] is always used to report RX error
    counter. can-utils also relies on this.
    
    This patch updates the comment in the uapi header to specify that
    data[5] is reserved (and thus should not be used) and that data[6..7]
    are used for error counters.

    fs: check FMODE_LSEEK to control internal pipe splicing
    
    [ Upstream commit 97ef77c52b789ec1411d360ed99dca1efe4b2c81 ]
    
    The original direct splicing mechanism from Jens required the input to
    be a regular file because it was avoiding the special socket case. It
    also recognized blkdevs as being close enough to a regular file. But it
    forgot about chardevs, which behave the same way and work fine here.
    
    This is an okayish heuristic, but it doesn't totally work. For example,
    a few chardevs should be spliceable here. And a few regular files
    shouldn't. This patch fixes this by instead checking whether FMODE_LSEEK
    is set, which represents decently enough what we need rewinding for when
    splicing to internal pipes.

    The return value from system() is a waitpid-style integer. Do not return

    libbpf: Fix the name of a reused map
    
    [ Upstream commit bf3f00378524adae16628cbadbd11ba7211863bb ]
    
    BPF map name is limited to BPF_OBJ_NAME_LEN.
    A map name is defined as being longer than BPF_OBJ_NAME_LEN,
    it will be truncated to BPF_OBJ_NAME_LEN when a userspace program
    calls libbpf to create the map. A pinned map also generates a path
    in the /sys. If the previous program wanted to reuse the map，
    it can not get bpf_map by name, because the name of the map is only
    partially the same as the name which get from pinned path.
    
    The syscall information below show that map name "process_pinned_map"
    is truncated to "process_pinned_".
    
        bpf(BPF_OBJ_GET, {pathname="/sys/fs/bpf/process_pinned_map",
        bpf_fd=0, file_flags=0}, 144) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
    
        bpf(BPF_MAP_CREATE, {map_type=BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH, key_size=4,
        value_size=4,max_entries=1024, map_flags=0, inner_map_fd=0,
        map_name="process_pinned_",map_ifindex=0, btf_fd=3, btf_key_type_id=6,
        btf_value_type_id=10,btf_vmlinux_value_type_id=0}, 72) = 4
    
    This patch check that if the name of pinned map are the same as the
    actual name for the first (BPF_OBJ_NAME_LEN - 1),
    bpf map still uses the name which is included in bpf object.

    media: platform: mtk-mdp: Fix mdp_ipi_comm structure alignment
    
    [ Upstream commit ab14c99c035da7156a3b66fa171171295bc4b89a ]
    
    The mdp_ipi_comm structure defines a command that is either
    PROCESS (start processing) or DEINIT (destroy instance); we
    are using this one to send PROCESS or DEINIT commands from Linux
    to an MDP instance through a VPU write but, while the first wants
    us to stay 4-bytes aligned, the VPU instead requires an 8-bytes
    data alignment.
    
    Keeping in mind that these commands are executed immediately
    after sending them (hence not chained with others before the
    VPU/MDP "actually" start executing), it is fine to simply add
    a padding of 4 bytes to this structure: this keeps the same
    performance as before, as we're still stack-allocating it,
    while avoiding hackery inside of mtk-vpu to ensure alignment
    bringing a definitely bigger performance impact.

    drm/vc4: dsi: Correct DSI divider calculations
    
    [ Upstream commit 3b45eee87da171caa28f61240ddb5c21170cda53 ]
    
    The divider calculations tried to find the divider just faster than the
    clock requested. However if it required a divider of 7 then the for loop
    aborted without handling the "error" case, and could end up with a clock
    lower than requested.
    
    The integer divider from parent PLL to DSI clock is also capable of
    going up to /255, not just /7 that the driver was trying.  This allows
    for slower link frequencies on the DSI bus where the resolution permits.
    
    Correct the loop so that we always have a clock greater than requested,
    and covering the whole range of dividers.

    media: hdpvr: fix error value returns in hdpvr_read
    
    [ Upstream commit 359c27c6ddbde404f44a9c0d3ec88ccd1e2042f2 ]
    
    Error return values are supposed to be negative in hdpvr_read. Most
    error returns are currently handled via an unsigned integer "ret". When
    setting a negative error value to "ret", the value actually becomes a
    large positive value, because "ret" is unsigned. Later on, the "ret"
    value is returned. But as ssize_t is a 64-bit signed number, the error
    return value stays a large positive integer instead of a negative
    integer. This can cause an error value to be interpreted as the read
    size, which can cause a buffer overread for applications relying on the
    returned size.

    wifi: iwlegacy: 4965: fix potential off-by-one overflow in il4965_rs_fill_link_cmd()
    
    [ Upstream commit a8eb8e6f7159c7c20c0ddac428bde3d110890aa7 ]
    
    As a result of the execution of the inner while loop, the value
    of 'idx' can be equal to LINK_QUAL_MAX_RETRY_NUM. However, this
    is not checked after the loop and 'idx' is used to write the
    LINK_QUAL_MAX_RETRY_NUM size array 'lq_cmd->rs_table[idx]' below
    in the outer loop.
    
    The fix is to check the new value of 'idx' inside the nested loop,
    and break both loops if index equals the size. Checking it at the
    start is now pointless, so let's remove it.

    Syzbot reported use-after-free Read in ath9k_hif_usb_rx_cb() [0]. The
    problem was in incorrect htc_handle->drv_priv initialization.
    
    Probable call trace which can trigger use-after-free:

    drm/mediatek: Add pull-down MIPI operation in mtk_dsi_poweroff function
    
    [ Upstream commit fa5d0a0205c34734c5b8daa77e39ac2817f63a10 ]
    
    In the dsi_enable function, mtk_dsi_rxtx_control is to
    pull up the MIPI signal operation. Before dsi_disable,
    MIPI should also be pulled down by writing a register
    instead of disabling dsi.
    
    If disable dsi without pulling the mipi signal low, the value of
    the register will still maintain the setting of the mipi signal being
    pulled high.
    After resume, even if the mipi signal is not pulled high, it will still
    be in the high state.

    of the second 'case' (the first one already has it).
    
    Also, remove redundant last checks for 'j' index bigger than array size.
    The expression is always false. Moreover, before or after the patch
    'table->last' can be equal to SMC_NISLANDS_MC_REGISTER_ARRAY_SIZE and it
    seems it can be a valid value.

    1) There is no need to check "buffer" for NULL.  That's handled by
    copy_from_user().
    2) The "h2c_len" variable cannot be negative because it is unsigned
    and because sscanf() does not return negative error codes.

    nohz/full, sched/rt: Fix missed tick-reenabling bug in dequeue_task_rt()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5c66d1b9b30f737fcef85a0b75bfe0590e16b62a ]
    
    dequeue_task_rt() only decrements 'rt_rq->rt_nr_running' after having
    called sched_update_tick_dependency() preventing it from re-enabling the
    tick on systems that no longer have pending SCHED_RT tasks but have
    multiple runnable SCHED_OTHER tasks:
    
      dequeue_task_rt()
        dequeue_rt_entity()
          dequeue_rt_stack()
            dequeue_top_rt_rq()
              sub_nr_running()      // decrements rq->nr_running
                sched_update_tick_dependency()
                  sched_can_stop_tick()     // checks rq->rt.rt_nr_running,

              dec_rt_tasks()        // decrements rq->rt.rt_nr_running
              ...
    
    Every other scheduler class performs the operation in the opposite
    order, and sched_update_tick_dependency() expects the values to be
    updated as such. So avoid the misbehaviour by inverting the order in
    which the above operations are performed in the RT scheduler.

    When offset is larger than the size of the bit array, we should not
    attempt to access the array as we can perform an access beyond the
    end of the array. Fix this by changing the pre-condition.
    
    Using "cmp r2, r1; bhs ..." covers us for the size == 0 case, since
    this will always take the branch when r1 is zero, irrespective of
    the value of r2. This means we can fix this bug without adding any
    additional code!

    PM: hibernate: defer device probing when resuming from hibernation
    
    [ Upstream commit 8386c414e27caba8501119948e9551e52b527f59 ]
    
    syzbot is reporting hung task at misc_open() [1], for there is a race
    window of AB-BA deadlock which involves probe_count variable. Currently
    wait_for_device_probe() from snapshot_open() from misc_open() can sleep
    forever with misc_mtx held if probe_count cannot become 0.
    
    When a device is probed by hub_event() work function, probe_count is
    incremented before the probe function starts, and probe_count is
    decremented after the probe function completed.
    
    There are three cases that can prevent probe_count from dropping to 0.
    
      (a) A device being probed stopped responding (i.e. broken/malicious
          hardware).
    
      (b) A process emulating a USB device using /dev/raw-gadget interface
          stopped responding for some reason.
    
      (c) New device probe requests keeps coming in before existing device
          probe requests complete.
    
    The phenomenon syzbot is reporting is (b). A process which is holding
    system_transition_mutex and misc_mtx is waiting for probe_count to become
    0 inside wait_for_device_probe(), but the probe function which is called
     from hub_event() work function is waiting for the processes which are
    blocked at mutex_lock(&misc_mtx) to respond via /dev/raw-gadget interface.
    
    This patch mitigates (b) by deferring wait_for_device_probe() from
    snapshot_open() to snapshot_write() and snapshot_ioctl(). Please note that
    the possibility of (b) remains as long as any thread which is emulating a
    USB device via /dev/raw-gadget interface can be blocked by uninterruptible
    blocking operations (e.g. mutex_lock()).
    
    Please also note that (a) and (c) are not addressed. Regarding (c), we
    should change the code to wait for only one device which contains the
    image for resuming from hibernation. I don't know how to address (a), for
    use of timeout for wait_for_device_probe() might result in loss of user
    data in the image. Maybe we should require the userland to wait for the
    image device before opening /dev/snapshot interface.

    ARM: dts: imx6ul: change operating-points to uint32-matrix
    
    [ Upstream commit edb67843983bbdf61b4c8c3c50618003d38bb4ae ]
    
    operating-points is a uint32-matrix as per opp-v1.yaml. Change it
    accordingly. While at it, change fsl,soc-operating-points as well,
    although there is no bindings file (yet). But they should have the same
    format. Fixes the dt_binding_check warning:
    cpu@0: operating-points:0: [696000, 1275000, 528000, 1175000, 396000,

    arm64: fix oops in concurrently setting insn_emulation sysctls
    
    [ Upstream commit af483947d472eccb79e42059276c4deed76f99a6 ]
    
    emulation_proc_handler() changes table->data for proc_dointvec_minmax
    and can generate the following Oops if called concurrently with itself:
    
     | Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000010
     | Internal error: Oops: 96000006 [#1] SMP

    To fix this issue, keep the table->data as &insn->current_mode and
    use container_of() to retrieve the insn pointer. Another mutex is
    used to protect against the current_mode update but not for retrieving
    insn_emulation as table->data is no longer changing.

    netfilter: nf_tables: fix null deref due to zeroed list head
    
    commit 580077855a40741cf511766129702d97ff02f4d9 upstream.
    
    In nf_tables_updtable, if nf_tables_table_enable returns an error,
    nft_trans_destroy is called to free the transaction object.
    
    nft_trans_destroy() calls list_del(), but the transaction was never
    placed on a list -- the list head is all zeroes, this results in
    a null dereference:
    
    BUG: KASAN: null-ptr-deref in nft_trans_destroy+0x26/0x59
    Call Trace:
     nft_trans_destroy+0x26/0x59
     nf_tables_newtable+0x4bc/0x9bc
     [..]
    
    Its sane to assume that nft_trans_destroy() can be called
    on the transaction object returned by nft_trans_alloc(), so
    make sure the list head is initialised.

    commit 470ee20e069a6d05ae549f7d0ef2bdbcee6a81b2 upstream.
    
    When doing lookups for sets on the same batch by using its ID, a set from a
    different table can be used.
    
    Then, when the table is removed, a reference to the set may be kept after
    the set is freed, leading to a potential use-after-free.
    
    When looking for sets by ID, use the table that was used for the lookup by
    name, and only return sets belonging to that same table.
    
    This fixes CVE-2022-2586, also reported as ZDI-CAN-17470.

    USB: HCD: Fix URB giveback issue in tasklet function
    
    commit 26c6c2f8a907c9e3a2f24990552a4d77235791e6 upstream.
    
    Usb core introduce the mechanism of giveback of URB in tasklet context to
    reduce hardware interrupt handling time. On some test situation(such as
    FIO with 4KB block size), when tasklet callback function called to
    giveback URB, interrupt handler add URB node to the bh->head list also.
    If check bh->head list again after finish all URB giveback of local_list,
    then it may introduce a "dynamic balance" between giveback URB and add URB
    to bh->head list. This tasklet callback function may not exit for a long
    time, which will cause other tasklet function calls to be delayed. Some
    real-time applications(such as KB and Mouse) will see noticeable lag.
    
    In order to prevent the tasklet function from occupying the cpu for a long
    time at a time, new URBS will not be added to the local_list even though
    the bh->head list is not empty. But also need to ensure the left URB
    giveback to be processed in time, so add a member high_prio for structure
    giveback_urb_bh to prioritize tasklet and schelule this tasklet again if
    bh->head list is not empty.
    
    At the same time, we are able to prioritize tasklet through structure
    member high_prio. So, replace the local high_prio_bh variable with this
    structure member in usb_hcd_giveback_urb.

    malicious QEMU and guest that ignore the absence of the
    KVM_CAP_PPC_HWRNG flag, and calls H_RANDOM anyway, will dereference a
    NULL pointer.
    
    In practice all Power8 machines have an "ibm,power-rng", but let's not
    rely on that, add a NULL check and early return in
    powernv_get_random_real_mode().

    powerpc/fsl-pci: Fix Class Code of PCIe Root Port
    
    commit 0c551abfa004ce154d487d91777bf221c808a64f upstream.
    
    By default old pre-3.0 Freescale PCIe controllers reports invalid PCI Class
    Code 0x0b20 for PCIe Root Port. It can be seen by lspci -b output on P2020
    board which has this pre-3.0 controller:
    
      $ lspci -bvnn
      00:00.0 Power PC [0b20]: Freescale Semiconductor Inc P2020E [1957:0070] (rev 21)
              !!! Invalid class 0b20 for header type 01
              Capabilities: [4c] Express Root Port (Slot-), MSI 00
    
    Fix this issue by programming correct PCI Class Code 0x0604 for PCIe Root
    Port to the Freescale specific PCIe register 0x474.
    
    With this change lspci -b output is:
    
      $ lspci -bvnn
      00:00.0 PCI bridge [0604]: Freescale Semiconductor Inc P2020E [1957:0070] (rev 21) (prog-if 00 [Normal decode])
              Capabilities: [4c] Express Root Port (Slot-), MSI 00
    
    Without any "Invalid class" error. So class code was properly reflected
    into standard (read-only) PCI register 0x08.
    
    Same fix is already implemented in U-Boot pcie_fsl.c driver in commit:
    http://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/commit/d18d06ac35229345a0af80977a408cfbe1d1015b
    
    Fix activated by U-Boot stay active also after booting Linux kernel.
    But boards which use older U-Boot version without that fix are affected and
    still require this fix.
    
    So implement this class code fix also in kernel fsl_pci.c driver.

    ia64, processor: fix -Wincompatible-pointer-types in ia64_get_irr()
    
    commit e5a16a5c4602c119262f350274021f90465f479d upstream.
    
    test_bit(), as any other bitmap op, takes `unsigned long *` as a
    second argument (pointer to the actual bitmap), as any bitmap
    itself is an array of unsigned longs. However, the ia64_get_irr()
    code passes a ref to `u64` as a second argument.
    This works with the ia64 bitops implementation due to that they
    have `void *` as the second argument and then cast it later on.
    This works with the bitmap API itself due to that `unsigned long`
    has the same size on ia64 as `u64` (`unsigned long long`), but
    from the compiler PoV those two are different.
    Define @irr as `unsigned long` to fix that. That implies no
    functional changes. Has been hidden for 16 years!

    md-raid10: fix KASAN warning
    
    commit d17f744e883b2f8d13cca252d71cfe8ace346f7d upstream.
    
    There's a KASAN warning in raid10_remove_disk when running the lvm
    test lvconvert-raid-reshape.sh. We fix this warning by verifying that the
    value "number" is valid.

    commit 06674fc7c003b9d0aa1d37fef7ab2c24802cc6ad upstream.
    
    The driver use the non-managed form of the register function in

    bpf: Verifer, adjust_scalar_min_max_vals to always call update_reg_bounds()
    
    From: John Fastabend <john.fastabend@gmail.com>
    
    commit 294f2fc6da27620a506e6c050241655459ccd6bd upstream.
    
    Currently, for all op verification we call __red_deduce_bounds() and
    __red_bound_offset() but we only call __update_reg_bounds() in bitwise
    ops. However, we could benefit from calling __update_reg_bounds() in
    BPF_ADD, BPF_SUB, and BPF_MUL cases as well.
    
    For example, a register with state 'R1_w=invP0' when we subtract from
    it,
    
     w1 -= 2
    
    Before coerce we will now have an smin_value=S64_MIN, smax_value=U64_MAX
    and unsigned bounds umin_value=0, umax_value=U64_MAX. These will then
    be clamped to S32_MIN, U32_MAX values by coerce in the case of alu32 op
    as done in above example. However tnum will be a constant because the
    ALU op is done on a constant.
    
    Without update_reg_bounds() we have a scenario where tnum is a const
    but our unsigned bounds do not reflect this. By calling update_reg_bounds
    after coerce to 32bit we further refine the umin_value to U64_MAX in the
    alu64 case or U32_MAX in the alu32 case above.

    drm/amdgpu: Check BO's requested pinning domains against its preferred_domains
    
    commit f5ba14043621f4afdf3ad5f92ee2d8dbebbe4340 upstream.
    
    When pinning a buffer, we should check to see if there are any
    additional restrictions imposed by bo->preferred_domains. This will
    prevent the BO from being moved to an invalid domain when pinning.
    
    For example, this can happen if the user requests to create a BO in GTT
    domain for display scanout. amdgpu_dm will allow pinning to either VRAM
    or GTT domains, since DCN can scanout from either or. However, in
    amdgpu_bo_pin_restricted(), pinning to VRAM is preferred if there is
    adequate carveout. This can lead to pinning to VRAM despite the user
    requesting GTT placement for the BO.
    
    v2: Allow the kernel to override the domain, which can happen when
        exporting a BO to a V4L camera (for example).

    ovl: drop WARN_ON() dentry is NULL in ovl_encode_fh()
    
    commit dd524b7f317de8d31d638cbfdc7be4cf9b770e42 upstream.
    
    Some code paths cannot guarantee the inode have any dentry alias. So
    WARN_ON() all !dentry may flood the kernel logs.
    
    For example, when an overlayfs inode is watched by inotifywait (1), and
    someone is trying to read the /proc/$(pidof inotifywait)/fdinfo/INOTIFY_FD,
    at that time if the dentry has been reclaimed by kernel (such as
    echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches), there will be a WARN_ON(). The
    printed call stack would be like:

    usbnet: Fix linkwatch use-after-free on disconnect
    
    commit a69e617e533edddf3fa3123149900f36e0a6dc74 upstream.
    
    usbnet uses the work usbnet_deferred_kevent() to perform tasks which may
    sleep.  On disconnect, completion of the work was originally awaited in
    ->ndo_stop().  But in 2003, that was moved to ->disconnect() by historic
    commit "[PATCH] USB: usbnet, prevent exotic rtnl deadlock":
    
      https://git.kernel.org/tglx/history/c/0f138bbfd83c
    
    The change was made because back then, the kernel's workqueue
    implementation did not allow waiting for a single work.  One had to wait
    for completion of *all* work by calling flush_scheduled_work(), and that
    could deadlock when waiting for usbnet_deferred_kevent() with rtnl_mutex
    held in ->ndo_stop().
    
    The commit solved one problem but created another:  It causes a
    use-after-free in USB Ethernet drivers aqc111.c, asix_devices.c,
    ax88179_178a.c, ch9200.c and smsc75xx.c:
    
    * If the drivers receive a link change interrupt immediately before
      disconnect, they raise EVENT_LINK_RESET in their (non-sleepable)
      ->status() callback and schedule usbnet_deferred_kevent().
    * usbnet_deferred_kevent() invokes the driver's ->link_reset() callback,
      which calls netif_carrier_{on,off}().
    * That in turn schedules the work linkwatch_event().
    
    Because usbnet_deferred_kevent() is awaited after unregister_netdev(),
    netif_carrier_{on,off}() may operate on an unregistered netdev and
    linkwatch_event() may run after free_netdev(), causing a use-after-free.
    
    In 2010, usbnet was changed to only wait for a single instance of
    usbnet_deferred_kevent() instead of *all* work by commit 23f333a2bfaf
    ("drivers/net: don't use flush_scheduled_work()").
    
    Unfortunately the commit neglected to move the wait back to
    ->ndo_stop().  Rectify that omission at long last.

    fbcon: Fix boundary checks for fbcon=vc:n1-n2 parameters
    
    commit cad564ca557f8d3bb3b1fa965d9a2b3f6490ec69 upstream.
    
    The user may use the fbcon=vc:<n1>-<n2> option to tell fbcon to take
    over the given range (n1...n2) of consoles. The value for n1 and n2
    needs to be a positive number and up to (MAX_NR_CONSOLES - 1).
    The given values were not fully checked against those boundaries yet.
    
    To fix the issue, convert first_fb_vc and last_fb_vc to unsigned
    integers and check them against the upper boundary, and make sure that
    first_fb_vc is smaller than last_fb_vc.

    thermal: sysfs: Fix cooling_device_stats_setup() error code path
    
    commit d5a8aa5d7d80d21ab6b266f1bed4194b61746199 upstream.
    
    If cooling_device_stats_setup() fails to create the stats object, it
    must clear the last slot in cooling_device_attr_groups that was
    initially empty (so as to make it possible to add stats attributes to
    the cooling device attribute groups).
    
    Failing to do so may cause the stats attributes to be created by
    mistake for a device that doesn't have a stats object, because the
    slot in question might be populated previously during the registration
    of another cooling device.

    All creation paths except for O_TMPFILE handle umask in the vfs directly
    if the filesystem doesn't support or enable POSIX ACLs. If the filesystem
    does then umask handling is deferred until posix_acl_create().
    Because, O_TMPFILE misses umask handling in the vfs it will not honor
    umask settings. Fix this by adding the missing umask handling.

    vfs: Check the truncate maximum size in inode_newsize_ok()
    
    commit e2ebff9c57fe4eb104ce4768f6ebcccf76bef849 upstream.
    
    If something manages to set the maximum file size to MAX_OFFSET+1, this
    can cause the xfs and ext4 filesystems at least to become corrupt.
    
    Ordinarily, the kernel protects against userspace trying this by
    checking the value early in the truncate() and ftruncate() system calls
    calls - but there are at least two places that this check is bypassed:
    
     (1) Cachefiles will round up the EOF of the backing file to DIO block
         size so as to allow DIO on the final block - but this might push
         the offset negative. It then calls notify_change(), but this
         inadvertently bypasses the checking. This can be triggered if
         someone puts an 8EiB-1 file on a server for someone else to try and
         access by, say, nfs.
    
     (2) ksmbd doesn't check the value it is given in set_end_of_file_info()
         and then calls vfs_truncate() directly - which also bypasses the
         check.
    
    In both cases, it is potentially possible for a network filesystem to
    cause a disk filesystem to be corrupted: cachefiles in the client's
    cache filesystem; ksmbd in the server's filesystem.
    
    nfsd is okay as it checks the value, but we can then remove this check
    too.
    
    Fix this by adding a check to inode_newsize_ok(), as called from
    setattr_prepare(), thereby catching the issue as filesystems set up to
    perform the truncate with minimal opportunity for bypassing the new
    check.

    KVM: x86: Set error code to segment selector on LLDT/LTR non-canonical #GP
    
    commit 2626206963ace9e8bf92b6eea5ff78dd674c555c upstream.
    
    When injecting a #GP on LLDT/LTR due to a non-canonical LDT/TSS base, set
    the error code to the selector.  Intel SDM's says nothing about the #GP,
    but AMD's APM explicitly states that both LLDT and LTR set the error code
    to the selector, not zero.
    
    Note, a non-canonical memory operand on LLDT/LTR does generate a #GP(0),
    but the KVM code in question is specific to the base from the descriptor.

    add barriers to buffer_uptodate and set_buffer_uptodate
    
    commit d4252071b97d2027d246f6a82cbee4d52f618b47 upstream.
    
    Let's have a look at this piece of code in __bread_slow:
    
            get_bh(bh);
            bh->b_end_io = end_buffer_read_sync;
            submit_bh(REQ_OP_READ, 0, bh);
            wait_on_buffer(bh);
            if (buffer_uptodate(bh))
                    return bh;
    
    Neither wait_on_buffer nor buffer_uptodate contain any memory barrier.
    Consequently, if someone calls sb_bread and then reads the buffer data,
    the read of buffer data may be executed before wait_on_buffer(bh) on
    architectures with weak memory ordering and it may return invalid data.
    
    Fix this bug by adding a memory barrier to set_buffer_uptodate and an
    acquire barrier to buffer_uptodate (in a similar way as
    folio_test_uptodate and folio_mark_uptodate).

    wifi: mac80211_hwsim: use 32-bit skb cookie
    
    commit cc5250cdb43d444061412df7fae72d2b4acbdf97 upstream.
    
    We won't really have enough skbs to need a 64-bit cookie,
    and on 32-bit platforms storing the 64-bit cookie into the
    void *rate_driver_data doesn't work anyway. Switch back to
    using just a 32-bit cookie and uintptr_t for the type to
    avoid compiler warnings about all this.

    commit 58b6259d820d63c2adf1c7541b54cce5a2ae6073 upstream.
    
    The robots report that we're now casting to a differently

    had erroneously removed it.

    wifi: mac80211_hwsim: fix race condition in pending packet
    
    commit 4ee186fa7e40ae06ebbfbad77e249e3746e14114 upstream.
    
    A pending packet uses a cookie as an unique key, but it can be duplicated
    because it didn't use atomic operators.
    
    And also, a pending packet can be null in hwsim_tx_info_frame_received_nl
    due to race condition with mac80211_hwsim_stop.
    
    For this,
     * Use an atomic type and operator for a cookie
     * Add a lock around the loop for pending packets

    ALSA: bcd2000: Fix a UAF bug on the error path of probing
    
    commit ffb2759df7efbc00187bfd9d1072434a13a54139 upstream.
    
    When the driver fails in snd_card_register() at probe time, it will free
    the 'bcd2k->midi_out_urb' before killing it, which may cause a UAF bug.
    
    The following log can reveal it:
    
    [   50.727020] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in bcd2000_input_complete+0x1f1/0x2e0 [snd_bcd2000]

    [   50.732899]  bcd2000_input_complete+0x1f1/0x2e0 [snd_bcd2000]
    
    Fix this by adding usb_kill_urb() before usb_free_urb().

    x86: link vdso and boot with -z noexecstack --no-warn-rwx-segments
    
    commit ffcf9c5700e49c0aee42dcba9a12ba21338e8136 upstream.
    
    Users of GNU ld (BFD) from binutils 2.39+ will observe multiple
    instances of a new warning when linking kernels in the form:
    
      ld: warning: arch/x86/boot/pmjump.o: missing .note.GNU-stack section implies executable stack
      ld: NOTE: This behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in a future version of the linker
      ld: warning: arch/x86/boot/compressed/vmlinux has a LOAD segment with RWX permissions
    
    Generally, we would like to avoid the stack being executable.  Because
    there could be a need for the stack to be executable, assembler sources
    have to opt-in to this security feature via explicit creation of the
    .note.GNU-stack feature (which compilers create by default) or command
    line flag --noexecstack.  Or we can simply tell the linker the
    production of such sections is irrelevant and to link the stack as
    --noexecstack.
    
    LLVM's LLD linker defaults to -z noexecstack, so this flag isn't
    strictly necessary when linking with LLD, only BFD, but it doesn't hurt
    to be explicit here for all linkers IMO.  --no-warn-rwx-segments is
    currently BFD specific and only available in the current latest release,
    so it's wrapped in an ld-option check.
    
    While the kernel makes extensive usage of ELF sections, it doesn't use
    permissions from ELF segments.
