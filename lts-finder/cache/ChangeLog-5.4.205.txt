    ida: don't use BUG_ON() for debugging
    
    commit fc82bbf4dede758007763867d0282353c06d1121 upstream.
    
    This is another old BUG_ON() that just shouldn't exist (see also commit
    a382f8fee42c: "signal handling: don't use BUG_ON() for debugging").
    
    In fact, as Matthew Wilcox points out, this condition shouldn't really
    even result in a warning, since a negative id allocation result is just
    a normal allocation failure:
    
      "I wonder if we should even warn here -- sure, the caller is trying to
       free something that wasn't allocated, but we don't warn for
       kfree(NULL)"
    
    and goes on to point out how that current error check is only causing
    people to unnecessarily do their own index range checking before freeing
    it.
    
    This was noted by Itay Iellin, because the bluetooth HCI socket cookie
    code does *not* do that range checking, and ends up just freeing the
    error case too, triggering the BUG_ON().
    
    The HCI code requires CAP_NET_RAW, and seems to just result in an ugly
    splat, but there really is no reason to BUG_ON() here, and we have
    generally striven for allocation models where it's always ok to just do
    
        free(alloc());
    
    even if the allocation were to fail for some random reason (usually
    obviously that "random" reason being some resource limit).

    same is that as that in the i.MX7 series but the imx7d MODULE_FIRMWARE
    directive is wrapped in a condiditional which means it's not defined

    selftests: forwarding: fix flood_unicast_test when h2 supports IFF_UNICAST_FLT
    
    [ Upstream commit b8e629b05f5d23f9649c901bef09fab8b0c2e4b9 ]
    
    As mentioned in the blamed commit, flood_unicast_test() works by
    checking the match count on a tc filter placed on the receiving
    interface.
    
    But the second host interface (host2_if) has no interest in receiving a
    packet with MAC DA de:ad:be:ef:13:37, so its RX filter drops it even
    before the ingress tc filter gets to be executed. So we will incorrectly
    get the message "Packet was not flooded when should", when in fact, the
    packet was flooded as expected but dropped due to an unrelated reason,
    at some other layer on the receiving side.
    
    Force h2 to accept this packet by temporarily placing it in promiscuous
    mode. Alternatively we could either deliver to its MAC address or use
    tcpdump_start, but this has the fewest complications.
    
    This fixes the "flooding" test from bridge_vlan_aware.sh and
    bridge_vlan_unaware.sh, which calls flood_test from the lib.

    so that upper levels are not left waiting for confirmation of a

    the apparent backlog will cause TCP to begin "congestion control"

    The firmware of M32C based Leaf devices expects bittiming parameters
    calculated for 16MHz clock. Since we use the actual clock frequency of
    the device, the device may end up with wrong bittiming parameters,

    fbcon: Prevent that screen size is smaller than font size
    
    commit e64242caef18b4a5840b0e7a9bff37abd4f4f933 upstream.
    
    We need to prevent that users configure a screen size which is smaller than the
    currently selected font size. Otherwise rendering chars on the screen will
    access memory outside the graphics memory region.
    
    This patch adds a new function fbcon_modechange_possible() which
    implements this check and which later may be extended with other checks
    if necessary.  The new function is called from the FBIOPUT_VSCREENINFO
    ioctl handler in fbmem.c, which will return -EINVAL if userspace asked
    for a too small screen size.

    Prevent that users set a font size which is bigger than the physical screen.
    It's unlikely this may happen (because screens are usually much larger than the
    fonts and each font char is limited to 32x32 pixels), but it may happen on

    iommu/vt-d: Fix PCI bus rescan device hot add
    
    commit 316f92a705a4c2bf4712135180d56f3cca09243a upstream.
    
    Notifier calling chain uses priority to determine the execution
    order of the notifiers or listeners registered to the chain.
    PCI bus device hot add utilizes the notification mechanism.
    
    The current code sets low priority (INT_MIN) to Intel
    dmar_pci_bus_notifier and postpones DMAR decoding after adding
    new device into IOMMU. The result is that struct device pointer
    cannot be found in DRHD search for the new device's DMAR/IOMMU.
    Subsequently, the device is put under the "catch-all" IOMMU
    instead of the correct one. This could cause system hang when
    device TLB invalidation is sent to the wrong IOMMU. Invalidation
    timeout error and hard lockup have been observed and data
    inconsistency/crush may occur as well.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by setting a positive priority(1) for
    dmar_pci_bus_notifier while the priority of IOMMU bus notifier
    uses the default value(0), therefore DMAR decoding will be in
    advance of DRHD search for a new device to find the correct IOMMU.
    
    Following is a 2-step example that triggers the bug by simulating
    PCI device hot add behavior in Intel Sapphire Rapids server.
    
    echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:6a:01.0/remove
    echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan

    net: rose: fix UAF bug caused by rose_t0timer_expiry
    
    commit 148ca04518070910739dfc4eeda765057856403d upstream.
    
    There are UAF bugs caused by rose_t0timer_expiry(). The
    root cause is that del_timer() could not stop the timer
    handler that is running and there is no synchronization.
    One of the race conditions is shown below:
    
        (thread 1)             |        (thread 2)
                               | rose_device_event
                               |   rose_rt_device_down
                               |     rose_remove_neigh
    rose_t0timer_expiry        |       rose_stop_t0timer(rose_neigh)
      ...                      |         del_timer(&neigh->t0timer)
                               |         kfree(rose_neigh) //[1]FREE
      neigh->dce_mode //[2]USE |
    
    The rose_neigh is deallocated in position [1] and use in
    position [2].
    
    The crash trace triggered by POC is like below:
    
    BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in expire_timers+0x144/0x320

    timer handler could be finished before the resources such as
    rose_neigh and so on are deallocated. As a result, the UAF
    bugs could be mitigated.

    can: gs_usb: gs_usb_open/close(): fix memory leak
    
    commit 2bda24ef95c0311ab93bda00db40486acf30bd0a upstream.
    
    The gs_usb driver appears to suffer from a malady common to many USB
    CAN adapter drivers in that it performs usb_alloc_coherent() to
    allocate a number of USB request blocks (URBs) for RX, and then later
    relies on usb_kill_anchored_urbs() to free them, but this doesn't
    actually free them. As a result, this may be leaking DMA memory that's
    been used by the driver.
    
    This commit is an adaptation of the techniques found in the esd_usb2
    driver where a similar design pattern led to a memory leak. It
    explicitly frees the RX URBs and their DMA memory via a call to
    usb_free_coherent(). Since the RX URBs were allocated in the
    gs_can_open(), we remove them in gs_can_close() rather than in the
    disconnect function as was done in esd_usb2.
    
    For more information, see the 928150fad41b ("can: esd_usb2: fix memory
    leak").

    can: bcm: use call_rcu() instead of costly synchronize_rcu()
    
    commit f1b4e32aca0811aa011c76e5d6cf2fa19224b386 upstream.
    
    In commit d5f9023fa61e ("can: bcm: delay release of struct bcm_op
    after synchronize_rcu()") Thadeu Lima de Souza Cascardo introduced two
    synchronize_rcu() calls in bcm_release() (only once at socket close)
    and in bcm_delete_rx_op() (called on removal of each single bcm_op).
    
    Unfortunately this slow removal of the bcm_op's affects user space
    applications like cansniffer where the modification of a filter
    removes 2048 bcm_op's which blocks the cansniffer application for
    40(!) seconds.
    
    In commit 181d4447905d ("can: gw: use call_rcu() instead of costly
    synchronize_rcu()") Eric Dumazet replaced the synchronize_rcu() calls
    with several call_rcu()'s to safely remove the data structures after
    the removal of CAN ID subscriptions with can_rx_unregister() calls.
    
    This patch adopts Erics approach for the can-bcm which should be
    applicable since the removal of tasklet_kill() in bcm_remove_op() and
    the introduction of the HRTIMER_MODE_SOFT timer handling in Linux 5.4.

    mm/slub: add missing TID updates on slab deactivation
    
    commit eeaa345e128515135ccb864c04482180c08e3259 upstream.
    
    The fastpath in slab_alloc_node() assumes that c->slab is stable as long as
    the TID stays the same. However, two places in __slab_alloc() currently
    don't update the TID when deactivating the CPU slab.
    
    If multiple operations race the right way, this could lead to an object
    getting lost; or, in an even more unlikely situation, it could even lead to
    an object being freed onto the wrong slab's freelist, messing up the
    `inuse` counter and eventually causing a page to be freed to the page
    allocator while it still contains slab objects.
    
    (I haven't actually tested these cases though, this is just based on
    looking at the code. Writing testcases for this stuff seems like it'd be
    a pain...)
    
    The race leading to state inconsistency is (all operations on the same CPU
    and kmem_cache):
    
     - task A: begin do_slab_free():
        - read TID
        - read pcpu freelist (==NULL)
        - check `slab == c->slab` (true)
     - [PREEMPT A->B]
     - task B: begin slab_alloc_node():
        - fastpath fails (`c->freelist` is NULL)
        - enter __slab_alloc()
        - slub_get_cpu_ptr() (disables preemption)
        - enter ___slab_alloc()
        - take local_lock_irqsave()
        - read c->freelist as NULL
        - get_freelist() returns NULL
        - write `c->slab = NULL`
        - drop local_unlock_irqrestore()
        - goto new_slab
        - slub_percpu_partial() is NULL
        - get_partial() returns NULL
        - slub_put_cpu_ptr() (enables preemption)
     - [PREEMPT B->A]
     - task A: finish do_slab_free():
        - this_cpu_cmpxchg_double() succeeds()
        - [CORRUPT STATE: c->slab==NULL, c->freelist!=NULL]
    
    From there, the object on c->freelist will get lost if task B is allowed to
    continue from here: It will proceed to the retry_load_slab label,
    set c->slab, then jump to load_freelist, which clobbers c->freelist.
    
    But if we instead continue as follows, we get worse corruption:
    
     - task A: run __slab_free() on object from other struct slab:
        - CPU_PARTIAL_FREE case (slab was on no list, is now on pcpu partial)
     - task A: run slab_alloc_node() with NUMA node constraint:
        - fastpath fails (c->slab is NULL)
        - call __slab_alloc()
        - slub_get_cpu_ptr() (disables preemption)
        - enter ___slab_alloc()
        - c->slab is NULL: goto new_slab
        - slub_percpu_partial() is non-NULL
        - set c->slab to slub_percpu_partial(c)
        - [CORRUPT STATE: c->slab points to slab-1, c->freelist has objects
          from slab-2]
        - goto redo
        - node_match() fails
        - goto deactivate_slab
        - existing c->freelist is passed into deactivate_slab()
        - inuse count of slab-1 is decremented to account for object from
          slab-2
    
    At this point, the inuse count of slab-1 is 1 lower than it should be.
    This means that if we free all allocated objects in slab-1 except for one,
    SLUB will think that slab-1 is completely unused, and may free its page,
    leading to use-after-free.

    esp: limit skb_page_frag_refill use to a single page
    
    commit 5bd8baab087dff657e05387aee802e70304cc813 upstream.
    
    Commit ebe48d368e97 ("esp: Fix possible buffer overflow in ESP
    transformation") tried to fix skb_page_frag_refill usage in ESP by
    capping allocsize to 32k, but that doesn't completely solve the issue,
    as skb_page_frag_refill may return a single page. If that happens, we
    will write out of bounds, despite the check introduced in the previous
    patch.
    
    This patch forces COW in cases where we would end up calling
    skb_page_frag_refill with a size larger than a page (first in
    esp_output_head with tailen, then in esp_output_tail with
    skb->data_len).
