    drm/i915/cdclk: Fix CDCLK programming order when pipes are active
    
    commit 7b1f6b5aaec0f849e19c3e99d4eea75876853cdd upstream.
    
    Currently we always reprogram CDCLK from the
    intel_set_cdclk_pre_plane_update() when using squash/crawl.
    The code only works correctly for the cd2x update or full
    modeset cases, and it was simply never updated to deal with
    squash/crawl.
    
    If the CDCLK frequency is increasing we must reprogram it
    before we do anything else that might depend on the new
    higher frequency, and conversely we must not decrease
    the frequency until everything that might still depend
    on the old higher frequency has been dealt with.
    
    Since cdclk_state->pipe is only relevant when doing a cd2x
    update we can't use it to determine the correct sequence
    during squash/crawl. To that end introduce cdclk_state->disable_pipes
    which simply indicates that we must perform the update
    while the pipes are disable (ie. during
    intel_set_cdclk_pre_plane_update()). Otherwise we use the
    same old vs. new CDCLK frequency comparsiong as for cd2x
    updates.
    
    The only remaining problem case is when the voltage_level
    needs to increase due to a DDI port, but the CDCLK frequency
    is decreasing (and not all pipes are being disabled). The
    current approach will not bump the voltage level up until
    after the port has already been enabled, which is too late.
    But we'll take care of that case separately.
    
    v2: Don't break the "must disable pipes case"
    v3: Keep the on stack 'pipe' for future use

    x86/bugs: Rename various 'ia32_cap' variables to 'x86_arch_cap_msr'
    
    commit d0485730d2189ffe5d986d4e9e191f1e4d5ffd24 upstream.
    
    So we are using the 'ia32_cap' value in a number of places,
    which got its name from MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES MSR register.
    
    But there's very little 'IA32' about it - this isn't 32-bit only
    code, nor does it originate from there, it's just a historic
    quirk that many Intel MSR names are prefixed with IA32_.
    
    This is already clear from the helper method around the MSR:
    x86_read_arch_cap_msr(), which doesn't have the IA32 prefix.
    
    So rename 'ia32_cap' to 'x86_arch_cap_msr' to be consistent with
    its role and with the naming of the helper function.

    x86/apic: Force native_apic_mem_read() to use the MOV instruction
    
    commit 5ce344beaca688f4cdea07045e0b8f03dc537e74 upstream.
    
    When done from a virtual machine, instructions that touch APIC memory
    must be emulated. By convention, MMIO accesses are typically performed
    via io.h helpers such as readl() or writeq() to simplify instruction
    emulation/decoding (ex: in KVM hosts and SEV guests) [0].
    
    Currently, native_apic_mem_read() does not follow this convention,
    allowing the compiler to emit instructions other than the MOV
    instruction generated by readl(). In particular, when the kernel is
    compiled with clang and run as a SEV-ES or SEV-SNP guest, the compiler
    would emit a TESTL instruction which is not supported by the SEV-ES
    emulator, causing a boot failure in that environment. It is likely the
    same problem would happen in a TDX guest as that uses the same
    instruction emulator as SEV-ES.
    
    To make sure all emulators can emulate APIC memory reads via MOV, use
    the readl() function in native_apic_mem_read(). It is expected that any
    emulator would support MOV in any addressing mode as it is the most
    generic and is what is usually emitted currently.
    
    The TESTL instruction is emitted when native_apic_mem_read() is inlined
    into apic_mem_wait_icr_idle(). The emulator comes from
    insn_decode_mmio() in arch/x86/lib/insn-eval.c. It's not worth it to
    extend insn_decode_mmio() to support more instructions since, in theory,
    the compiler could choose to output nearly any instruction for such
    reads which would bloat the emulator beyond reason.

      │ should know what you are doing to say so.
    
    As is, the kernel still defaults to CPU_MITIGATIONS_AUTO, which results in
    some mitigations being enabled in spite of SPECULATION_MITIGATIONS=n.

    On x86 each struct cpu_hw_events maintains a table for counter assignment but
    it missed to update one for the deleted event in x86_pmu_del().  This

    vhost: Add smp_rmb() in vhost_vq_avail_empty()
    
    commit 22e1992cf7b034db5325660e98c41ca5afa5f519 upstream.
    
    A smp_rmb() has been missed in vhost_vq_avail_empty(), spotted by
    Will. Otherwise, it's not ensured the available ring entries pushed
    by guest can be observed by vhost in time, leading to stale available
    ring entries fetched by vhost in vhost_get_vq_desc(), as reported by
    Yihuang Yu on NVidia's grace-hopper (ARM64) platform.

      virtio_net virtio0: output.0:id 100 is not a head!
    
    Add the missed smp_rmb() in vhost_vq_avail_empty(). When tx_can_batch()
    returns true, it means there's still pending tx buffers. Since it might
    read indices, so it still can bypass the smp_rmb() in vhost_get_vq_desc().
    Note that it should be safe until vq->avail_idx is changed by commit
    275bf960ac697 ("vhost: better detection of available buffers").

    The modes[] array contains pointers to modes on the connectors'

    Thus we need to extend modes[] the same protection or by the

    btrfs: qgroup: correctly model root qgroup rsv in convert
    
    commit 141fb8cd206ace23c02cd2791c6da52c1d77d42a upstream.
    
    We use add_root_meta_rsv and sub_root_meta_rsv to track prealloc and
    pertrans reservations for subvolumes when quotas are enabled. The
    convert function does not properly increment pertrans after decrementing
    prealloc, so the count is not accurate.
    
    Note: we check that the fs is not read-only to mirror the logic in
    qgroup_convert_meta, which checks that before adding to the pertrans rsv.

    net: ena: Fix incorrect descriptor free behavior
    
    [ Upstream commit bf02d9fe00632d22fa91d34749c7aacf397b6cde ]
    
    ENA has two types of TX queues:
    - queues which only process TX packets arriving from the network stack
    - queues which only process TX packets forwarded to it by XDP_REDIRECT
      or XDP_TX instructions
    
    The ena_free_tx_bufs() cycles through all descriptors in a TX queue
    and unmaps + frees every descriptor that hasn't been acknowledged yet
    by the device (uncompleted TX transactions).
    The function assumes that the processed TX queue is necessarily from
    the first category listed above and ends up using napi_consume_skb()
    for descriptors belonging to an XDP specific queue.
    
    This patch solves a bug in which, in case of a VF reset, the
    descriptors aren't freed correctly, leading to crashes.

    net: ena: Wrong missing IO completions check order
    
    [ Upstream commit f7e417180665234fdb7af2ebe33d89aaa434d16f ]
    
    Missing IO completions check is called every second (HZ jiffies).
    This commit fixes several issues with this check:
    
    1. Duplicate queues check:
       Max of 4 queues are scanned on each check due to monitor budget.
       Once reaching the budget, this check exits under the assumption that
       the next check will continue to scan the remainder of the queues,
       but in practice, next check will first scan the last already scanned
       queue which is not necessary and may cause the full queue scan to
       last a couple of seconds longer.
       The fix is to start every check with the next queue to scan.
       For example, on 8 IO queues:
       Bug: [0,1,2,3], [3,4,5,6], [6,7]
       Fix: [0,1,2,3], [4,5,6,7]
    
    2. Unbalanced queues check:
       In case the number of active IO queues is not a multiple of budget,
       there will be checks which don't utilize the full budget
       because the full scan exits when reaching the last queue id.
       The fix is to run every TX completion check with exact queue budget
       regardless of the queue id.
       For example, on 7 IO queues:
       Bug: [0,1,2,3], [4,5,6], [0,1,2,3]
       Fix: [0,1,2,3], [4,5,6,0], [1,2,3,4]
       The budget may be lowered in case the number of IO queues is less
       than the budget (4) to make sure there are no duplicate queues on
       the same check.
       For example, on 3 IO queues:
       Bug: [0,1,2,0], [1,2,0,1]
       Fix: [0,1,2], [0,1,2]

    net: ena: Fix potential sign extension issue
    
    [ Upstream commit 713a85195aad25d8a26786a37b674e3e5ec09e3c ]
    
    Small unsigned types are promoted to larger signed types in
    the case of multiplication, the result of which may overflow.
    In case the result of such a multiplication has its MSB
    turned on, it will be sign extended with '1's.
    This changes the multiplication result.
    
    Code example of the phenomenon:
    -------------------------------
    u16 x, y;
    size_t z1, z2;
    
    x = y = 0xffff;
    printk("x=%x y=%x\n",x,y);
    
    z1 = x*y;
    z2 = (size_t)x*y;
    
    printk("z1=%lx z2=%lx\n", z1, z2);
    
    Output:
    -------
    x=ffff y=ffff
    z1=fffffffffffe0001 z2=fffe0001
    
    The expected result of ffff*ffff is fffe0001, and without the
    explicit casting to avoid the unwanted sign extension we got
    fffffffffffe0001.
    
    This commit adds an explicit casting to avoid the sign extension
    issue.

    af_unix: Fix garbage collector racing against connect()
    
    [ Upstream commit 47d8ac011fe1c9251070e1bd64cb10b48193ec51 ]
    
    Garbage collector does not take into account the risk of embryo getting
    enqueued during the garbage collection. If such embryo has a peer that
    carries SCM_RIGHTS, two consecutive passes of scan_children() may see a
    different set of children. Leading to an incorrectly elevated inflight
    count, and then a dangling pointer within the gc_inflight_list.
    
    sockets are AF_UNIX/SOCK_STREAM
    S is an unconnected socket
    L is a listening in-flight socket bound to addr, not in fdtable
    V's fd will be passed via sendmsg(), gets inflight count bumped
    
    connect(S, addr)        sendmsg(S, [V]); close(V)       __unix_gc()
    ----------------        -------------------------       -----------
    
    NS = unix_create1()

                                                    // V count=1 inflight=2 (!)
    
    If there is a GC-candidate listening socket, lock/unlock its state. This
    makes GC wait until the end of any ongoing connect() to that socket. After
    flipping the lock, a possibly SCM-laden embryo is already enqueued. And if
    there is another embryo coming, it can not possibly carry SCM_RIGHTS. At
    this point, unix_inflight() can not happen because unix_gc_lock is already
    taken. Inflight graph remains unaffected.

    net: dsa: mt7530: trap link-local frames regardless of ST Port State
    
    [ Upstream commit 17c560113231ddc20088553c7b499b289b664311 ]
    
    In Clause 5 of IEEE Std 802-2014, two sublayers of the data link layer
    (DLL) of the Open Systems Interconnection basic reference model (OSI/RM)
    are described; the medium access control (MAC) and logical link control
    (LLC) sublayers. The MAC sublayer is the one facing the physical layer.
    
    In 8.2 of IEEE Std 802.1Q-2022, the Bridge architecture is described. A
    Bridge component comprises a MAC Relay Entity for interconnecting the Ports
    of the Bridge, at least two Ports, and higher layer entities with at least
    a Spanning Tree Protocol Entity included.
    
    Each Bridge Port also functions as an end station and shall provide the MAC
    Service to an LLC Entity. Each instance of the MAC Service is provided to a
    distinct LLC Entity that supports protocol identification, multiplexing,
    and demultiplexing, for protocol data unit (PDU) transmission and reception
    by one or more higher layer entities.
    
    It is described in 8.13.9 of IEEE Std 802.1Q-2022 that in a Bridge, the LLC
    Entity associated with each Bridge Port is modeled as being directly
    connected to the attached Local Area Network (LAN).
    
    On the switch with CPU port architecture, CPU port functions as Management
    Port, and the Management Port functionality is provided by software which
    functions as an end station. Software is connected to an IEEE 802 LAN that
    is wholly contained within the system that incorporates the Bridge.
    Software provides access to the LLC Entity associated with each Bridge Port
    by the value of the source port field on the special tag on the frame
    received by software.
    
    We call frames that carry control information to determine the active
    topology and current extent of each Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN),
    i.e., spanning tree or Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) and Multiple VLAN
    Registration Protocol Data Units (MVRPDUs), and frames from other link
    constrained protocols, such as Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN
    (EAPOL) and Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), link-local frames. They
    are not forwarded by a Bridge. Permanently configured entries in the
    filtering database (FDB) ensure that such frames are discarded by the
    Forwarding Process. In 8.6.3 of IEEE Std 802.1Q-2022, this is described in
    detail:
    
    Each of the reserved MAC addresses specified in Table 8-1
    (01-80-C2-00-00-[00,01,02,03,04,05,06,07,08,09,0A,0B,0C,0D,0E,0F]) shall be
    permanently configured in the FDB in C-VLAN components and ERs.
    
    Each of the reserved MAC addresses specified in Table 8-2
    (01-80-C2-00-00-[01,02,03,04,05,06,07,08,09,0A,0E]) shall be permanently
    configured in the FDB in S-VLAN components.
    
    Each of the reserved MAC addresses specified in Table 8-3
    (01-80-C2-00-00-[01,02,04,0E]) shall be permanently configured in the FDB
    in TPMR components.
    
    The FDB entries for reserved MAC addresses shall specify filtering for all
    Bridge Ports and all VIDs. Management shall not provide the capability to
    modify or remove entries for reserved MAC addresses.
    
    The addresses in Table 8-1, Table 8-2, and Table 8-3 determine the scope of
    propagation of PDUs within a Bridged Network, as follows:
    
      The Nearest Bridge group address (01-80-C2-00-00-0E) is an address that
      no conformant Two-Port MAC Relay (TPMR) component, Service VLAN (S-VLAN)
      component, Customer VLAN (C-VLAN) component, or MAC Bridge can forward.
      PDUs transmitted using this destination address, or any other addresses
      that appear in Table 8-1, Table 8-2, and Table 8-3
      (01-80-C2-00-00-[00,01,02,03,04,05,06,07,08,09,0A,0B,0C,0D,0E,0F]), can
      therefore travel no further than those stations that can be reached via a
      single individual LAN from the originating station.
    
      The Nearest non-TPMR Bridge group address (01-80-C2-00-00-03), is an
      address that no conformant S-VLAN component, C-VLAN component, or MAC
      Bridge can forward; however, this address is relayed by a TPMR component.
      PDUs using this destination address, or any of the other addresses that
      appear in both Table 8-1 and Table 8-2 but not in Table 8-3
      (01-80-C2-00-00-[00,03,05,06,07,08,09,0A,0B,0C,0D,0F]), will be relayed
      by any TPMRs but will propagate no further than the nearest S-VLAN
      component, C-VLAN component, or MAC Bridge.
    
      The Nearest Customer Bridge group address (01-80-C2-00-00-00) is an
      address that no conformant C-VLAN component, MAC Bridge can forward;
      however, it is relayed by TPMR components and S-VLAN components. PDUs
      using this destination address, or any of the other addresses that appear
      in Table 8-1 but not in either Table 8-2 or Table 8-3
      (01-80-C2-00-00-[00,0B,0C,0D,0F]), will be relayed by TPMR components and
      S-VLAN components but will propagate no further than the nearest C-VLAN
      component or MAC Bridge.
    
    Because the LLC Entity associated with each Bridge Port is provided via CPU
    port, we must not filter these frames but forward them to CPU port.
    
    In a Bridge, the transmission Port is majorly decided by ingress and egress
    rules, FDB, and spanning tree Port State functions of the Forwarding
    Process. For link-local frames, only CPU port should be designated as
    destination port in the FDB, and the other functions of the Forwarding
    Process must not interfere with the decision of the transmission Port. We
    call this process trapping frames to CPU port.
    
    Therefore, on the switch with CPU port architecture, link-local frames must
    be trapped to CPU port, and certain link-local frames received by a Port of
    a Bridge comprising a TPMR component or an S-VLAN component must be
    excluded from it.
    
    A Bridge of the switch with CPU port architecture cannot comprise a
    Two-Port MAC Relay (TPMR) component as a TPMR component supports only a
    subset of the functionality of a MAC Bridge. A Bridge comprising two Ports
    (Management Port doesn't count) of this architecture will either function
    as a standard MAC Bridge or a standard VLAN Bridge.
    
    Therefore, a Bridge of this architecture can only comprise S-VLAN
    components, C-VLAN components, or MAC Bridge components. Since there's no
    TPMR component, we don't need to relay PDUs using the destination addresses
    specified on the Nearest non-TPMR section, and the proportion of the
    Nearest Customer Bridge section where they must be relayed by TPMR
    components.
    
    One option to trap link-local frames to CPU port is to add static FDB
    entries with CPU port designated as destination port. However, because that
    Independent VLAN Learning (IVL) is being used on every VID, each entry only
    applies to a single VLAN Identifier (VID). For a Bridge comprising a MAC
    Bridge component or a C-VLAN component, there would have to be 16 times
    4096 entries. This switch intellectual property can only hold a maximum of
    2048 entries. Using this option, there also isn't a mechanism to prevent
    link-local frames from being discarded when the spanning tree Port State of
    the reception Port is discarding.
    
    The remaining option is to utilise the BPC, RGAC1, RGAC2, RGAC3, and RGAC4
    registers. Whilst this applies to every VID, it doesn't contain all of the
    reserved MAC addresses without affecting the remaining Standard Group MAC
    Addresses. The REV_UN frame tag utilised using the RGAC4 register covers
    the remaining 01-80-C2-00-00-[04,05,06,07,08,09,0A,0B,0C,0D,0F] destination
    addresses. It also includes the 01-80-C2-00-00-22 to 01-80-C2-00-00-FF
    destination addresses which may be relayed by MAC Bridges or VLAN Bridges.
    The latter option provides better but not complete conformance.
    
    This switch intellectual property also does not provide a mechanism to trap
    link-local frames with specific destination addresses to CPU port by
    Bridge, to conform to the filtering rules for the distinct Bridge
    components.
    
    Therefore, regardless of the type of the Bridge component, link-local
    frames with these destination addresses will be trapped to CPU port:
    
    01-80-C2-00-00-[00,01,02,03,0E]
    
    In a Bridge comprising a MAC Bridge component or a C-VLAN component:
    
      Link-local frames with these destination addresses won't be trapped to
      CPU port which won't conform to IEEE Std 802.1Q-2022:
    
      01-80-C2-00-00-[04,05,06,07,08,09,0A,0B,0C,0D,0F]
    
    In a Bridge comprising an S-VLAN component:
    
      Link-local frames with these destination addresses will be trapped to CPU
      port which won't conform to IEEE Std 802.1Q-2022:
    
      01-80-C2-00-00-00
    
      Link-local frames with these destination addresses won't be trapped to
      CPU port which won't conform to IEEE Std 802.1Q-2022:
    
      01-80-C2-00-00-[04,05,06,07,08,09,0A]
    
    Currently on this switch intellectual property, if the spanning tree Port
    State of the reception Port is discarding, link-local frames will be
    discarded.
    
    To trap link-local frames regardless of the spanning tree Port State, make
    the switch regard them as Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs). This switch
    intellectual property only lets the frames regarded as BPDUs bypass the
    spanning tree Port State function of the Forwarding Process.
    
    With this change, the only remaining interference is the ingress rules.
    When the reception Port has no PVID assigned on software, VLAN-untagged
    frames won't be allowed in. There doesn't seem to be a mechanism on the
    switch intellectual property to have link-local frames bypass this function
    of the Forwarding Process.

    net/mlx5: Properly link new fs rules into the tree
    
    [ Upstream commit 7c6782ad4911cbee874e85630226ed389ff2e453 ]
    
    Previously, add_rule_fg would only add newly created rules from the
    handle into the tree when they had a refcount of 1. On the other hand,
    create_flow_handle tries hard to find and reference already existing
    identical rules instead of creating new ones.
    
    These two behaviors can result in a situation where create_flow_handle
    1) creates a new rule and references it, then
    2) in a subsequent step during the same handle creation references it
       again,
    resulting in a rule with a refcount of 2 that is not linked into the
    tree, will have a NULL parent and root and will result in a crash when
    the flow group is deleted because del_sw_hw_rule, invoked on rule
    deletion, assumes node->parent is != NULL.
    
    This happened in the wild, due to another bug related to incorrect
    handling of duplicate pkt_reformat ids, which lead to the code in
    create_flow_handle incorrectly referencing a just-added rule in the same
    flow handle, resulting in the problem described above. Full details are
    at [1].
    
    This patch changes add_rule_fg to add new rules without parents into
    the tree, properly initializing them and avoiding the crash. This makes
    it more consistent with how rules are added to an FTE in
    create_flow_handle.

    ipv6: fix race condition between ipv6_get_ifaddr and ipv6_del_addr
    
    [ Upstream commit 7633c4da919ad51164acbf1aa322cc1a3ead6129 ]
    
    Although ipv6_get_ifaddr walks inet6_addr_lst under the RCU lock, it
    still means hlist_for_each_entry_rcu can return an item that got removed
    from the list. The memory itself of such item is not freed thanks to RCU
    but nothing guarantees the actual content of the memory is sane.
    
    In particular, the reference count can be zero. This can happen if
    ipv6_del_addr is called in parallel. ipv6_del_addr removes the entry
    from inet6_addr_lst (hlist_del_init_rcu(&ifp->addr_lst)) and drops all
    references (__in6_ifa_put(ifp) + in6_ifa_put(ifp)). With bad enough
    timing, this can happen:
    
    1. In ipv6_get_ifaddr, hlist_for_each_entry_rcu returns an entry.
    
    2. Then, the whole ipv6_del_addr is executed for the given entry. The
       reference count drops to zero and kfree_rcu is scheduled.
    
    3. ipv6_get_ifaddr continues and tries to increments the reference count
       (in6_ifa_hold).
    
    4. The rcu is unlocked and the entry is freed.
    
    5. The freed entry is returned.
    
    Prevent increasing of the reference count in such case. The name
    in6_ifa_hold_safe is chosen to mimic the existing fib6_info_hold_safe.

    af_unix: Clear stale u->oob_skb.
    
    [ Upstream commit b46f4eaa4f0ec38909fb0072eea3aeddb32f954e ]
    
    syzkaller started to report deadlock of unix_gc_lock after commit
    4090fa373f0e ("af_unix: Replace garbage collection algorithm."), but
    it just uncovers the bug that has been there since commit 314001f0bf92
    ("af_unix: Add OOB support").
    
    The repro basically does the following.
    
      from socket import *
      from array import array
    
      c1, c2 = socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM)
      c1.sendmsg([b'a'], [(SOL_SOCKET, SCM_RIGHTS, array("i", [c2.fileno()]))], MSG_OOB)
      c2.recv(1)  # blocked as no normal data in recv queue
    
      c2.close()  # done async and unblock recv()
      c1.close()  # done async and trigger GC
    
    A socket sends its file descriptor to itself as OOB data and tries to
    receive normal data, but finally recv() fails due to async close().
    
    The problem here is wrong handling of OOB skb in manage_oob().  When
    recvmsg() is called without MSG_OOB, manage_oob() is called to check
    if the peeked skb is OOB skb.  In such a case, manage_oob() pops it
    out of the receive queue but does not clear unix_sock(sk)->oob_skb.
    This is wrong in terms of uAPI.
    
    Let's say we send "hello" with MSG_OOB, and "world" without MSG_OOB.
    The 'o' is handled as OOB data.  When recv() is called twice without
    MSG_OOB, the OOB data should be lost.
    
      >>> from socket import *
      >>> c1, c2 = socketpair(AF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0)
      >>> c1.send(b'hello', MSG_OOB)  # 'o' is OOB data
      5
      >>> c1.send(b'world')
      5
      >>> c2.recv(5)  # OOB data is not received
      b'hell'
      >>> c2.recv(5)  # OOB date is skipped
      b'world'
      >>> c2.recv(5, MSG_OOB)  # This should return an error
      b'o'
    
    In the same situation, TCP actually returns -EINVAL for the last
    recv().
    
    Also, if we do not clear unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb, unix_poll() always set
    EPOLLPRI even though the data has passed through by previous recv().
    
    To avoid these issues, we must clear unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb when dequeuing
    it from recv queue.
    
    The reason why the old GC did not trigger the deadlock is because the
    old GC relied on the receive queue to detect the loop.
    
    When it is triggered, the socket with OOB data is marked as GC candidate
    because file refcount == inflight count (1).  However, after traversing
    all inflight sockets, the socket still has a positive inflight count (1),
    thus the socket is excluded from candidates.  Then, the old GC lose the
    chance to garbage-collect the socket.
    
    With the old GC, the repro continues to create true garbage that will
    never be freed nor detected by kmemleak as it's linked to the global
    inflight list.  That's why we couldn't even notice the issue.

    geneve: fix header validation in geneve[6]_xmit_skb
    
    [ Upstream commit d8a6213d70accb403b82924a1c229e733433a5ef ]
    
    syzbot is able to trigger an uninit-value in geneve_xmit() [1]
    
    Problem : While most ip tunnel helpers (like ip_tunnel_get_dsfield())
    uses skb_protocol(skb, true), pskb_inet_may_pull() is only using
    skb->protocol.
    
    If anything else than ETH_P_IPV6 or ETH_P_IP is found in skb->protocol,
    pskb_inet_may_pull() does nothing at all.
    
    If a vlan tag was provided by the caller (af_packet in the syzbot case),
    the network header might not point to the correct location, and skb
    linear part could be smaller than expected.
    
    Add skb_vlan_inet_prepare() to perform a complete mac validation.
    
    Use this in geneve for the moment, I suspect we need to adopt this
    more broadly.
    
    v4 - Jakub reported v3 broke l2_tos_ttl_inherit.sh selftest
       - Only call __vlan_get_protocol() for vlan types.

    u64_stats: Disable preemption on 32bit UP+SMP PREEMPT_RT during updates.
    
    [ Upstream commit 3c118547f87e930d45a5787e386734015dd93b32 ]
    
    On PREEMPT_RT the seqcount_t for synchronisation is required on 32bit
    architectures even on UP because the softirq (and the threaded IRQ handler) can
    be preempted.
    
    With the seqcount_t for synchronisation, a reader with higher priority can
    preempt the writer and then spin endlessly in read_seqcount_begin() while the
    writer can't make progress.
    
    To avoid such a lock up on PREEMPT_RT the writer must disable preemption during
    the update. There is no need to disable interrupts because no writer is using
    this API in hard-IRQ context on PREEMPT_RT.
    
    Disable preemption on 32bit-RT within the u64_stats write section.

    net: openvswitch: fix unwanted error log on timeout policy probing
    
    [ Upstream commit 4539f91f2a801c0c028c252bffae56030cfb2cae ]
    
    On startup, ovs-vswitchd probes different datapath features including
    support for timeout policies.  While probing, it tries to execute
    certain operations with OVS_PACKET_ATTR_PROBE or OVS_FLOW_ATTR_PROBE
    attributes set.  These attributes tell the openvswitch module to not
    log any errors when they occur as it is expected that some of the
    probes will fail.
    
    For some reason, setting the timeout policy ignores the PROBE attribute
    and logs a failure anyway.  This is causing the following kernel log
    on each re-start of ovs-vswitchd:
    
      kernel: Failed to associated timeout policy `ovs_test_tp'
    
    Fix that by using the same logging macro that all other messages are
    using.  The message will still be printed at info level when needed
    and will be rate limited, but with a net rate limiter instead of
    generic printk one.
    
    The nf_ct_set_timeout() itself will still print some info messages,
    but at least this change makes logging in openvswitch module more
    consistent.

    media: cec: core: remove length check of Timer Status
    
    commit ce5d241c3ad4568c12842168288993234345c0eb upstream.
    
    The valid_la is used to check the length requirements,
    including special cases of Timer Status. If the length is
    shorter than 5, that means no Duration Available is returned,
    the message will be forced to be invalid.
    
    However, the description of Duration Available in the spec
    is that this parameter may be returned when these cases, or
    that it can be optionally return when these cases. The key
    words in the spec description are flexible choices.
    
    Remove the special length check of Timer Status to fit the
    spec which is not compulsory about that.

    ring-buffer: Only update pages_touched when a new page is touched
    
    commit ffe3986fece696cf65e0ef99e74c75f848be8e30 upstream.
    
    The "buffer_percent" logic that is used by the ring buffer splice code to
    only wake up the tasks when there's no data after the buffer is filled to
    the percentage of the "buffer_percent" file is dependent on three
    variables that determine the amount of data that is in the ring buffer:
    
     1) pages_read - incremented whenever a new sub-buffer is consumed
     2) pages_lost - incremented every time a writer overwrites a sub-buffer
     3) pages_touched - incremented when a write goes to a new sub-buffer
    
    The percentage is the calculation of:
    
      (pages_touched - (pages_lost + pages_read)) / nr_pages
    
    Basically, the amount of data is the total number of sub-bufs that have been
    touched, minus the number of sub-bufs lost and sub-bufs consumed. This is
    divided by the total count to give the buffer percentage. When the
    percentage is greater than the value in the "buffer_percent" file, it
    wakes up splice readers waiting for that amount.
    
    It was observed that over time, the amount read from the splice was
    constantly decreasing the longer the trace was running. That is, if one
    asked for 60%, it would read over 60% when it first starts tracing, but
    then it would be woken up at under 60% and would slowly decrease the
    amount of data read after being woken up, where the amount becomes much
    less than the buffer percent.
    
    This was due to an accounting of the pages_touched incrementation. This
    value is incremented whenever a writer transfers to a new sub-buffer. But
    the place where it was incremented was incorrect. If a writer overflowed
    the current sub-buffer it would go to the next one. If it gets preempted
    by an interrupt at that time, and the interrupt performs a trace, it too
    will end up going to the next sub-buffer. But only one should increment
    the counter. Unfortunately, that was not the case.
    
    Change the cmpxchg() that does the real switch of the tail-page into a
    try_cmpxchg(), and on success, perform the increment of pages_touched. This
    will only increment the counter once for when the writer moves to a new
    sub-buffer, and not when there's a race and is incremented for when a
    writer and its preempting writer both move to the same new sub-buffer.

    batman-adv: Avoid infinite loop trying to resize local TT
    
    commit b1f532a3b1e6d2e5559c7ace49322922637a28aa upstream.
    
    If the MTU of one of an attached interface becomes too small to transmit
    the local translation table then it must be resized to fit inside all
    fragments (when enabled) or a single packet.
    
    But if the MTU becomes too low to transmit even the header + the VLAN
    specific part then the resizing of the local TT will never succeed. This
    can for example happen when the usable space is 110 bytes and 11 VLANs are
    on top of batman-adv. In this case, at least 116 byte would be needed.
    There will just be an endless spam of
    
       batman_adv: batadv0: Forced to purge local tt entries to fit new maximum fragment MTU (110)
    
    in the log but the function will never finish. Problem here is that the
    timeout will be halved all the time and will then stagnate at 0 and
    therefore never be able to reduce the table even more.
    
    There are other scenarios possible with a similar result. The number of
    BATADV_TT_CLIENT_NOPURGE entries in the local TT can for example be too
    high to fit inside a packet. Such a scenario can therefore happen also with
    only a single VLAN + 7 non-purgable addresses - requiring at least 120
    bytes.
    
    While this should be handled proactively when:
    
    * interface with too low MTU is added
    * VLAN is added
    * non-purgeable local mac is added
    * MTU of an attached interface is reduced
    * fragmentation setting gets disabled (which most likely requires dropping
      attached interfaces)
    
    not all of these scenarios can be prevented because batman-adv is only
    consuming events without the the possibility to prevent these actions
    (non-purgable MAC address added, MTU of an attached interface is reduced).
    It is therefore necessary to also make sure that the code is able to handle
    also the situations when there were already incompatible system
    configuration are present.
