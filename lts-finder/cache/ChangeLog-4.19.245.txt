    afs: Fix afs_getattr() to refetch file status if callback break occurred
    
    [ Upstream commit 2aeb8c86d49967552394d5e723f87454cb53f501 ]
    
    If a callback break occurs (change notification), afs_getattr() needs to
    issue an FS.FetchStatus RPC operation to update the status of the file
    being examined by the stat-family of system calls.
    
    Fix afs_getattr() to do this if AFS_VNODE_CB_PROMISED has been cleared
    on a vnode by a callback break.  Skip this if AT_STATX_DONT_SYNC is set.
    
    This can be tested by appending to a file on one AFS client and then
    using "stat -L" to examine its length on a machine running kafs.  This
    can also be watched through tracing on the kafs machine.  The callback
    break is seen:
    
         kworker/1:1-46      [001] .....   978.910812: afs_cb_call: c=0000005f YFSCB.CallBack
         kworker/1:1-46      [001] ...1.   978.910829: afs_cb_break: 100058:23b4c:242d2c2 b=2 s=1 break-cb
         kworker/1:1-46      [001] .....   978.911062: afs_call_done:    c=0000005f ret=0 ab=0 [0000000082994ead]
    
    And then the stat command generated no traffic if unpatched, but with
    this change a call to fetch the status can be observed:
    
                stat-4471    [000] .....   986.744122: afs_make_fs_call: c=000000ab 100058:023b4c:242d2c2 YFS.FetchStatus
                stat-4471    [000] .....   986.745578: afs_call_done:    c=000000ab ret=0 ab=0 [0000000087fc8c84]

    Reinstate some of "swiotlb: rework "fix info leak with DMA_FROM_DEVICE""
    
    commit 901c7280ca0d5e2b4a8929fbe0bfb007ac2a6544 upstream.
    
    Halil Pasic points out [1] that the full revert of that commit (revert
    in bddac7c1e02b), and that a partial revert that only reverts the
    problematic case, but still keeps some of the cleanups is probably
    better.  ￼
    
    And that partial revert [2] had already been verified by Oleksandr
    Natalenko to also fix the issue, I had just missed that in the long
    discussion.
    
    So let's reinstate the cleanups from commit aa6f8dcbab47 ("swiotlb:
    rework "fix info leak with DMA_FROM_DEVICE""), and effectively only
    revert the part that caused problems.

    swiotlb: fix info leak with DMA_FROM_DEVICE
    
    commit ddbd89deb7d32b1fbb879f48d68fda1a8ac58e8e upstream.
    
    The problem I'm addressing was discovered by the LTP test covering
    cve-2018-1000204.
    
    A short description of what happens follows:
    1) The test case issues a command code 00 (TEST UNIT READY) via the SG_IO
       interface with: dxfer_len == 524288, dxdfer_dir == SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV
       and a corresponding dxferp. The peculiar thing about this is that TUR
       is not reading from the device.
    2) In sg_start_req() the invocation of blk_rq_map_user() effectively
       bounces the user-space buffer. As if the device was to transfer into
       it. Since commit a45b599ad808 ("scsi: sg: allocate with __GFP_ZERO in
       sg_build_indirect()") we make sure this first bounce buffer is
       allocated with GFP_ZERO.
    3) For the rest of the story we keep ignoring that we have a TUR, so the
       device won't touch the buffer we prepare as if the we had a
       DMA_FROM_DEVICE type of situation. My setup uses a virtio-scsi device
       and the  buffer allocated by SG is mapped by the function
       virtqueue_add_split() which uses DMA_FROM_DEVICE for the "in" sgs (here
       scatter-gather and not scsi generics). This mapping involves bouncing
       via the swiotlb (we need swiotlb to do virtio in protected guest like
       s390 Secure Execution, or AMD SEV).
    4) When the SCSI TUR is done, we first copy back the content of the second
       (that is swiotlb) bounce buffer (which most likely contains some
       previous IO data), to the first bounce buffer, which contains all
       zeros.  Then we copy back the content of the first bounce buffer to
       the user-space buffer.
    5) The test case detects that the buffer, which it zero-initialized,
      ain't all zeros and fails.
    
    One can argue that this is an swiotlb problem, because without swiotlb
    we leak all zeros, and the swiotlb should be transparent in a sense that
    it does not affect the outcome (if all other participants are well
    behaved).
    
    Copying the content of the original buffer into the swiotlb buffer is
    the only way I can think of to make swiotlb transparent in such
    scenarios. So let's do just that if in doubt, but allow the driver
    to tell us that the whole mapped buffer is going to be overwritten,
    in which case we can preserve the old behavior and avoid the performance
    impact of the extra bounce.

    scsi: qla2xxx: Fix missed DMA unmap for aborted commands
    
    [ Upstream commit 26f9ce53817a8fd84b69a73473a7de852a24c897 ]
    
    Aborting commands that have already been sent to the firmware can
    cause BUG in qlt_free_cmd(): BUG_ON(cmd->sg_mapped)
    
    For instance:
    
     - Command passes rdx_to_xfer state, maps sgl, sends to the firmware
    
     - Reset occurs, qla2xxx performs ISP error recovery, aborts the command
    
     - Target stack calls qlt_abort_cmd() and then qlt_free_cmd()
    
     - BUG_ON(cmd->sg_mapped) in qlt_free_cmd() occurs because sgl was not
       unmapped
    
    Thus, unmap sgl in qlt_abort_cmd() for commands with the aborted flag set.

    net: bridge: Clear offload_fwd_mark when passing frame up bridge interface.
    
    [ Upstream commit fbb3abdf2223cd0dfc07de85fe5a43ba7f435bdf ]
    
    It is possible to stack bridges on top of each other. Consider the
    following which makes use of an Ethernet switch:
    
           br1
         /    \
        /      \
       /        \
     br0.11    wlan0
       |
       br0
     /  |  \
    p1  p2  p3
    
    br0 is offloaded to the switch. Above br0 is a vlan interface, for
    vlan 11. This vlan interface is then a slave of br1. br1 also has a
    wireless interface as a slave. This setup trunks wireless lan traffic
    over the copper network inside a VLAN.
    
    A frame received on p1 which is passed up to the bridge has the
    skb->offload_fwd_mark flag set to true, indicating that the switch has
    dealt with forwarding the frame out ports p2 and p3 as needed. This
    flag instructs the software bridge it does not need to pass the frame
    back down again. However, the flag is not getting reset when the frame
    is passed upwards. As a result br1 sees the flag, wrongly interprets
    it, and fails to forward the frame to wlan0.
    
    When passing a frame upwards, clear the flag. This is the Rx
    equivalent of br_switchdev_frame_unmark() in br_dev_xmit().

    igb_read_phy_reg() will silently return, leaving phy_data untouched, if

    or looping continuously for 2 seconds before emitting a noisy err-level
    timeout. This message went out to the console even though there was no
    actual problem.
    
    Instead, first check if there is read_reg function pointer. If not,
    proceed without trying to check the phy status register.

    [ Upstream commit 3cfb3019979666bdf33a1010147363cf05e0f17b ]
    
    In Thumb2, 'b . + 4' produces a branch instruction that uses a narrow
    encoding, and so it does not jump to the following instruction as
    expected. So use W(b) instead.

    net/mlx5e: Properly block LRO when XDP is enabled
    
    [ Upstream commit cf6e34c8c22fba66bd21244b95ea47e235f68974 ]
    
    LRO is incompatible and mutually exclusive with XDP. However, the needed
    checks are only made when enabling XDP. If LRO is enabled when XDP is
    already active, the command will succeed, and XDP will be skipped in the
    data path, although still enabled.
    
    This commit fixes the bug by checking the XDP status in
    mlx5e_fix_features and disabling LRO if XDP is enabled.

    NFC: nci: fix sleep in atomic context bugs caused by nci_skb_alloc
    
    [ Upstream commit 23dd4581350d4ffa23d58976ec46408f8f4c1e16 ]
    
    There are sleep in atomic context bugs when the request to secure
    element of st-nci is timeout. The root cause is that nci_skb_alloc
    with GFP_KERNEL parameter is called in st_nci_se_wt_timeout which is
    a timer handler. The call paths that could trigger bugs are shown below:
    
        (interrupt context 1)
    st_nci_se_wt_timeout
      nci_hci_send_event
        nci_hci_send_data
          nci_skb_alloc(..., GFP_KERNEL) //may sleep
    
       (interrupt context 2)
    st_nci_se_wt_timeout
      nci_hci_send_event
        nci_hci_send_data
          nci_send_data
            nci_queue_tx_data_frags
              nci_skb_alloc(..., GFP_KERNEL) //may sleep
    
    This patch changes allocation mode of nci_skb_alloc from GFP_KERNEL to
    GFP_ATOMIC in order to prevent atomic context sleeping. The GFP_ATOMIC
    flag makes memory allocation operation could be used in atomic context.

    net/qla3xxx: Fix a test in ql_reset_work()
    
    [ Upstream commit 5361448e45fac6fb96738df748229432a62d78b6 ]
    
    test_bit() tests if one bit is set or not.
    Here the logic seems to check of bit QL_RESET_PER_SCSI (i.e. 4) OR bit
    QL_RESET_START (i.e. 3) is set.
    
    In fact, it checks if bit 7 (4 | 3 = 7) is set, that is to say
    QL_ADAPTER_UP.
    
    This looks harmless, because this bit is likely be set, and when the
    ql_reset_work() delayed work is scheduled in ql3xxx_isr() (the only place
    that schedule this work), QL_RESET_START or QL_RESET_PER_SCSI is set.
    
    This has been spotted by smatch.

    net: vmxnet3: fix possible NULL pointer dereference in vmxnet3_rq_cleanup()
    
    [ Upstream commit edf410cb74dc612fd47ef5be319c5a0bcd6e6ccd ]
    
    In vmxnet3_rq_create(), when dma_alloc_coherent() fails,
    vmxnet3_rq_destroy() is called. It sets rq->rx_ring[i].base to NULL. Then
    vmxnet3_rq_create() returns an error to its callers mxnet3_rq_create_all()
    -> vmxnet3_change_mtu(). Then vmxnet3_change_mtu() calls
    vmxnet3_force_close() -> dev_close() in error handling code. And the driver
    calls vmxnet3_close() -> vmxnet3_quiesce_dev() -> vmxnet3_rq_cleanup_all()
    -> vmxnet3_rq_cleanup(). In vmxnet3_rq_cleanup(),
    rq->rx_ring[ring_idx].base is accessed, but this variable is NULL, causing
    a NULL pointer dereference.
    
    To fix this possible bug, an if statement is added to check whether
    rq->rx_ring[0].base is NULL in vmxnet3_rq_cleanup() and exit early if so.
    
    The error log in our fault-injection testing is shown as follows:

    net: vmxnet3: fix possible use-after-free bugs in vmxnet3_rq_alloc_rx_buf()
    
    [ Upstream commit 9e7fef9521e73ca8afd7da9e58c14654b02dfad8 ]
    
    In vmxnet3_rq_alloc_rx_buf(), when dma_map_single() fails, rbi->skb is
    freed immediately. Similarly, in another branch, when dma_map_page() fails,
    rbi->page is also freed. In the two cases, vmxnet3_rq_alloc_rx_buf()
    returns an error to its callers vmxnet3_rq_init() -> vmxnet3_rq_init_all()
    -> vmxnet3_activate_dev(). Then vmxnet3_activate_dev() calls
    vmxnet3_rq_cleanup_all() in error handling code, and rbi->skb or rbi->page
    are freed again in vmxnet3_rq_cleanup_all(), causing use-after-free bugs.
    
    To fix these possible bugs, rbi->skb and rbi->page should be cleared after
    they are freed.

    the while loop preparing the skb and data buffers. If the skb or data
    buffer allocation fails, this BD will be unusable BDs until the head
    loops back to the same BD (and obviously buffer allocation succeeds).
    In the unlikely event that there's a string of allocation failures,
    there will be an equal number of unusable BDs and an inconsistent RX
    BD chain. Hence increment the head at the end of the while loop to be
    clean.

    mmc: core: Default to generic_cmd6_time as timeout in __mmc_switch()
    
    commit 533a6cfe08f96a7b5c65e06d20916d552c11b256 upstream
    
    All callers of __mmc_switch() should now be specifying a valid timeout for
    the CMD6 command. However, just to be sure, let's print a warning and
    default to use the generic_cmd6_time in case the provided timeout_ms
    argument is zero.
    
    In this context, let's also simplify some of the corresponding code and
    clarify some related comments.

    mmc: block: Use generic_cmd6_time when modifying INAND_CMD38_ARG_EXT_CSD
    
    commit ad91619aa9d78ab1c6d4a969c3db68bc331ae76c upstream
    
    The INAND_CMD38_ARG_EXT_CSD is a vendor specific EXT_CSD register, which is
    used to prepare an erase/trim operation. However, it doesn't make sense to
    use a timeout of 10 minutes while updating the register, which becomes the
    case when the timeout_ms argument for mmc_switch() is set to zero.
    
    Instead, let's use the generic_cmd6_time, as that seems like a reasonable
    timeout to use for these cases.

    mmc: core: Specify timeouts for BKOPS and CACHE_FLUSH for eMMC
    
    commit 24ed3bd01d6a844fd5e8a75f48d0a3d10ed71bf9 upstream
    
    The timeout values used while waiting for a CMD6 for BKOPS or a CACHE_FLUSH
    to complete, are not defined by the eMMC spec. However, a timeout of 10
    minutes as is currently being used, is just silly for both of these cases.
    Instead, let's specify more reasonable timeouts, 120s for BKOPS and 30s for
    CACHE_FLUSH.

    mmc: core: Cleanup BKOPS support
    
    commit 0c204979c691f05666ecfb74501e7adfdde8fbf9 upstream
    
    It's been ~6 years ago since we introduced the BKOPS support for eMMC
    cards. The current code is a bit messy and primarily that's because it
    prepares to support running BKOPS in an asynchronous mode. However, that
    mode has never been fully implemented/enabled. Instead BKOPS is always
    executed in synchronously, when the card has reported an urgent BKOPS
    level.
    
    For these reasons, let's make the code more readable by dropping the unused
    parts. Let's also rename mmc_start_bkops() to mmc_run_bkops(), as to make
    it more descriptive.

    crypto: qcom-rng - fix infinite loop on requests not multiple of WORD_SZ
    
    commit 16287397ec5c08aa58db6acf7dbc55470d78087d upstream.
    
    The commit referenced in the Fixes tag removed the 'break' from the else
    branch in qcom_rng_read(), causing an infinite loop whenever 'max' is
    not a multiple of WORD_SZ. This can be reproduced e.g. by running:
    
        kcapi-rng -b 67 >/dev/null
    
    There are many ways to fix this without adding back the 'break', but
    they all seem more awkward than simply adding it back, so do just that.
    
    Tested on a machine with Qualcomm Amberwing processor.

    PCI/PM: Avoid putting Elo i2 PCIe Ports in D3cold
    
    commit 92597f97a40bf661bebceb92e26ff87c76d562d4 upstream.
    
    If a Root Port on Elo i2 is put into D3cold and then back into D0, the
    downstream device becomes permanently inaccessible, so add a bridge D3 DMI
    quirk for that system.
    
    This was exposed by 14858dcc3b35 ("PCI: Use pci_update_current_state() in
    pci_enable_device_flags()"), but before that commit the Root Port in
    question had never been put into D3cold for real due to a mismatch between
    its power state retrieved from the PCI_PM_CTRL register (which was
    accessible even though the platform firmware indicated that the port was in
    D3cold) and the state of an ACPI power resource involved in its power
    management.

    Fix double fget() in vhost_net_set_backend()
    
    commit fb4554c2232e44d595920f4d5c66cf8f7d13f9bc upstream.
    
    Descriptor table is a shared resource; two fget() on the same descriptor
    may return different struct file references.  get_tap_ptr_ring() is
    called after we'd found (and pinned) the socket we'll be using and it
    tries to find the private tun/tap data structures associated with it.
    Redoing the lookup by the same file descriptor we'd used to get the
    socket is racy - we need to same struct file.
    
    Thanks to Jason for spotting a braino in the original variant of patch -
    I'd missed the use of fd == -1 for disabling backend, and in that case
    we can end up with sock == NULL and sock != oldsock.

    perf: Fix sys_perf_event_open() race against self
    
    commit 3ac6487e584a1eb54071dbe1212e05b884136704 upstream.
    
    Norbert reported that it's possible to race sys_perf_event_open() such
    that the looser ends up in another context from the group leader,
    triggering many WARNs.
    
    The move_group case checks for races against itself, but the
    !move_group case doesn't, seemingly relying on the previous
    group_leader->ctx == ctx check. However, that check is racy due to not
    holding any locks at that time.
    
    Therefore, re-check the result after acquiring locks and bailing
    if they no longer match.
    
    Additionally, clarify the not_move_group case from the
    move_group-vs-move_group race.

    nilfs2: fix lockdep warnings in page operations for btree nodes
    
    [ Upstream commit e897be17a441fa637cd166fc3de1445131e57692 ]
    
    Patch series "nilfs2 lockdep warning fixes".
    
    The first two are to resolve the lockdep warning issue, and the last one
    is the accompanying cleanup and low priority.
    
    Based on your comment, this series solves the issue by separating inode
    object as needed.  Since I was worried about the impact of the object
    composition changes, I tested the series carefully not to cause
    regressions especially for delicate functions such like disk space
    reclamation and snapshots.
    
    This patch (of 3):
    
    If CONFIG_LOCKDEP is enabled, nilfs2 hits lockdep warnings at
    inode_to_wb() during page/folio operations for btree nodes:

    This is because nilfs2 uses two page caches for each inode and
    inode->i_mapping never points to one of them, the btree node cache.
    
    This causes inode_to_wb(inode) to refer to a different page cache than
    the caller page/folio operations such like __folio_start_writeback(),
    __folio_end_writeback(), or __folio_mark_dirty() acquired the lock.
    
    This patch resolves the issue by allocating and using an additional
    inode to hold the page cache of btree nodes.  The inode is attached
    one-to-one to the traditional nilfs2 inode if it requires a block
    mapping with b-tree.  This setup change is in memory only and does not
    affect the disk format.

    drbd: remove usage of list iterator variable after loop
    
    [ Upstream commit 901aeda62efa21f2eae937bccb71b49ae531be06 ]
    
    In preparation to limit the scope of a list iterator to the list
    traversal loop, use a dedicated pointer to iterate through the list [1].
    
    Since that variable should not be used past the loop iteration, a
    separate variable is used to 'remember the current location within the
    loop'.
    
    To either continue iterating from that position or skip the iteration
    (if the previous iteration was complete) list_prepare_entry() is used.

    MIPS: lantiq: check the return value of kzalloc()
    
    [ Upstream commit 34123208bbcc8c884a0489f543a23fe9eebb5514 ]
    
    kzalloc() is a memory allocation function which can return NULL when
    some internal memory errors happen. So it is better to check the
    return value of it to prevent potential wrong memory access or
    memory leak.

    um: Cleanup syscall_handler_t definition/cast, fix warning
    
    [ Upstream commit f4f03f299a56ce4d73c5431e0327b3b6cb55ebb9 ]
    
    The syscall_handler_t type for x86_64 was defined as 'long (*)(void)',
    but always cast to 'long (*)(long, long, long, long, long, long)' before
    use. This now triggers a warning (see below).
    
    Define syscall_handler_t as the latter instead, and remove the cast.
    This simplifies the code, and fixes the warning.

    floppy: use a statically allocated error counter
    
    commit f71f01394f742fc4558b3f9f4c7ef4c4cf3b07c8 upstream.
    
    Interrupt handler bad_flp_intr() may cause a UAF on the recently freed
    request just to increment the error count.  There's no point keeping
    that one in the request anyway, and since the interrupt handler uses a
    static pointer to the error which cannot be kept in sync with the
    pending request, better make it use a static error counter that's reset
    for each new request.  This reset now happens when entering
    redo_fd_request() for a new request via set_next_request().
    
    One initial concern about a single error counter was that errors on one
    floppy drive could be reported on another one, but this problem is not
    real given that the driver uses a single drive at a time, as that
    PC-compatible controllers also have this limitation by using shared
    signals.  As such the error count is always for the "current" drive.
