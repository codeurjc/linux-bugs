    tcp/udp: Fix memory leak in ipv6_renew_options().
    
    commit 3c52c6bb831f6335c176a0fc7214e26f43adbd11 upstream.
    
    syzbot reported a memory leak [0] related to IPV6_ADDRFORM.
    
    The scenario is that while one thread is converting an IPv6 socket into
    IPv4 with IPV6_ADDRFORM, another thread calls do_ipv6_setsockopt() and
    allocates memory to inet6_sk(sk)->XXX after conversion.
    
    Then, the converted sk with (tcp|udp)_prot never frees the IPv6 resources,
    which inet6_destroy_sock() should have cleaned up.
    
    setsockopt(IPV6_ADDRFORM)                 setsockopt(IPV6_DSTOPTS)
    +-----------------------+                 +----------------------+
    - do_ipv6_setsockopt(sk, ...)
      - sockopt_lock_sock(sk)                 - do_ipv6_setsockopt(sk, ...)
        - lock_sock(sk)                         ^._ called via tcpv6_prot
      - WRITE_ONCE(sk->sk_prot, &tcp_prot)          before WRITE_ONCE()
      - xchg(&np->opt, NULL)
      - txopt_put(opt)
      - sockopt_release_sock(sk)
        - release_sock(sk)                      - sockopt_lock_sock(sk)
                                                  - lock_sock(sk)
                                                - ipv6_set_opt_hdr(sk, ...)
                                                  - ipv6_update_options(sk, opt)
                                                    - xchg(&inet6_sk(sk)->opt, opt)
                                                      ^._ opt is never freed.
    
                                                - sockopt_release_sock(sk)
                                                  - release_sock(sk)
    
    Since IPV6_DSTOPTS allocates options under lock_sock(), we can avoid this
    memory leak by testing whether sk_family is changed by IPV6_ADDRFORM after
    acquiring the lock.
    
    This issue exists from the initial commit between IPV6_ADDRFORM and
    IPV6_PKTOPTIONS.

    serial: Deassert Transmit Enable on probe in driver-specific way
    
    commit 7c7f9bc986e698873b489c371a08f206979d06b7 upstream.
    
    When a UART port is newly registered, uart_configure_port() seeks to
    deassert RS485 Transmit Enable by setting the RTS bit in port->mctrl.
    However a number of UART drivers interpret a set RTS bit as *assertion*
    instead of deassertion:  Affected drivers include those using
    serial8250_em485_config() (except 8250_bcm2835aux.c) and some using
    mctrl_gpio (e.g. imx.c).
    
    Since the interpretation of the RTS bit is driver-specific, it is not
    suitable as a means to centrally deassert Transmit Enable in the serial
    core.  Instead, the serial core must call on drivers to deassert it in
    their driver-specific way.  One way to achieve that is to call
    ->rs485_config().  It implicitly deasserts Transmit Enable.
    
    So amend uart_configure_port() and uart_resume_port() to invoke
    uart_rs485_config().  That allows removing calls to uart_rs485_config()
    from drivers' ->probe() hooks and declaring the function static.
    
    Skip any invocation of ->set_mctrl() if RS485 is enabled.  RS485 has no
    hardware flow control, so the modem control lines are irrelevant and
    need not be touched.  When leaving RS485 mode, reset the modem control
    lines to the state stored in port->mctrl.  That way, UARTs which are
    muxed between RS485 and RS232 transceivers drive the lines correctly
    when switched to RS232.  (serial8250_do_startup() historically raises
    the OUT1 modem signal because otherwise interrupts are not signaled on
    ancient PC UARTs, but I believe that no longer applies to modern,
    RS485-capable UARTs and is thus safe to be skipped.)
    
    imx.c modifies port->mctrl whenever Transmit Enable is asserted and
    deasserted.  Stop it from doing that so port->mctrl reflects the RS232
    line state.
    
    8250_omap.c deasserts Transmit Enable on ->runtime_resume() by calling
    ->set_mctrl().  Because that is now a no-op in RS485 mode, amend the
    function to call serial8250_em485_stop_tx().
    
    fsl_lpuart.c retrieves and applies the RS485 device tree properties
    after registering the UART port.  Because applying now happens on
    registration in uart_configure_port(), move retrieval of the properties
    ahead of uart_add_one_port().

    serial: core: move RS485 configuration tasks from drivers into core
    
    commit 0ed12afa5655512ee418047fb3546d229df20aa1 upstream.
    
    Several drivers that support setting the RS485 configuration via userspace
    implement one or more of the following tasks:
    
    - in case of an invalid RTS configuration (both RTS after send and RTS on
      send set or both unset) fall back to enable RTS on send and disable RTS
      after send
    
    - nullify the padding field of the returned serial_rs485 struct
    
    - copy the configuration into the uart port struct
    
    - limit RTS delays to 100 ms
    
    Move these tasks into the serial core to make them generic and to provide
    a consistent behaviour among all drivers.

    can: rcar_canfd: rcar_canfd_handle_global_receive(): fix IRQ storm on global FIFO receive
    
    commit 702de2c21eed04c67cefaaedc248ef16e5f6b293 upstream.
    
    We are seeing an IRQ storm on the global receive IRQ line under heavy
    CAN bus load conditions with both CAN channels enabled.
    
    Conditions:
    
    The global receive IRQ line is shared between can0 and can1, either of
    the channels can trigger interrupt while the other channel's IRQ line
    is disabled (RFIE).
    
    When global a receive IRQ interrupt occurs, we mask the interrupt in
    the IRQ handler. Clearing and unmasking of the interrupt is happening
    in rx_poll(). There is a race condition where rx_poll() unmasks the
    interrupt, but the next IRQ handler does not mask the IRQ due to
    NAPIF_STATE_MISSED flag (e.g.: can0 RX FIFO interrupt is disabled and
    can1 is triggering RX interrupt, the delay in rx_poll() processing
    results in setting NAPIF_STATE_MISSED flag) leading to an IRQ storm.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by checking IRQ active and enabled before
    handling the IRQ on a particular channel.

    can: rcar_canfd: fix channel specific IRQ handling for RZ/G2L
    
    commit d887087c896881715c1a82f1d4f71fbfe5344ffd upstream.
    
    RZ/G2L has separate channel specific IRQs for transmit and error
    interrupts. But the IRQ handler processes both channels, even if there
    no interrupt occurred on one of the channels.
    
    This patch fixes the issue by passing a channel specific context
    parameter instead of global one for the IRQ register and the IRQ
    handler, it just handles the channel which is triggered the interrupt.

    scsi: sd: Revert "scsi: sd: Remove a local variable"
    
    This reverts commit 84f7a9de0602704bbec774a6c7f7c8c4994bee9c.
    
    Because it introduces a problem that rq->__data_len is set to the wrong
    value.
    
    before the patch:
    1) nr_bytes = rq->__data_len
    2) rq->__data_len = sdp->sector_size
    3) scsi_init_io()
    4) rq->__data_len = nr_bytes
    
    after the patch:
    1) rq->__data_len = sdp->sector_size
    2) scsi_init_io()
    3) rq->__data_len = rq->__data_len -> __data_len is wrong
    
    It will cause that io can only complete one segment each time, and the io
    will requeue in scsi_io_completion_action(), which will cause severe
    performance degradation.
    
    Scsi write same is removed in commit e383e16e84e9 ("scsi: sd: Remove
    WRITE_SAME support") from mainline, hence this patch is only needed for
    stable kernels.

    net: enetc: survive memory pressure without crashing
    
    [ Upstream commit 84ce1ca3fe9e1249bf21176ff162200f1c4e5ed1 ]
    
    Under memory pressure, enetc_refill_rx_ring() may fail, and when called
    during the enetc_open() -> enetc_setup_rxbdr() procedure, this is not
    checked for.
    
    An extreme case of memory pressure will result in exactly zero buffers
    being allocated for the RX ring, and in such a case it is expected that
    hardware drops all RX packets due to lack of buffers.
    
    This does not happen, because the reset-default value of the consumer
    and produces index is 0, and this makes the ENETC think that all buffers
    have been initialized and that it owns them (when in reality none were).
    
    The hardware guide explains this best:
    
    | Configure the receive ring producer index register RBaPIR with a value
    | of 0. The producer index is initially configured by software but owned
    | by hardware after the ring has been enabled. Hardware increments the
    | index when a frame is received which may consume one or more BDs.
    | Hardware is not allowed to increment the producer index to match the
    | consumer index since it is used to indicate an empty condition. The ring
    | can hold at most RBLENR[LENGTH]-1 received BDs.
    |
    | Configure the receive ring consumer index register RBaCIR. The
    | consumer index is owned by software and updated during operation of the
    | of the BD ring by software, to indicate that any receive data occupied
    | in the BD has been processed and it has been prepared for new data.
    | - If consumer index and producer index are initialized to the same
    |   value, it indicates that all BDs in the ring have been prepared and
    |   hardware owns all of the entries.
    | - If consumer index is initialized to producer index plus N, it would
    |   indicate N BDs have been prepared. Note that hardware cannot start if
    |   only a single buffer is prepared due to the restrictions described in
    |   (2).
    | - Software may write consumer index to match producer index anytime
    |   while the ring is operational to indicate all received BDs prior have
    |   been processed and new BDs prepared for hardware.
    
    Normally, the value of rx_ring->rcir (consumer index) is brought in sync
    with the rx_ring->next_to_use software index, but this only happens if
    page allocation ever succeeded.
    
    When PI==CI==0, the hardware appears to receive frames and write them to
    DMA address 0x0 (?!), then set the READY bit in the BD.
    
    The enetc_clean_rx_ring() function (and its XDP derivative) is naturally
    not prepared to handle such a condition. It will attempt to process
    those frames using the rx_swbd structure associated with index i of the
    RX ring, but that structure is not fully initialized (enetc_new_page()
    does all of that). So what happens next is undefined behavior.
    
    To operate using no buffer, we must initialize the CI to PI + 1, which
    will block the hardware from advancing the CI any further, and drop
    everything.
    
    The issue was seen while adding support for zero-copy AF_XDP sockets,
    where buffer memory comes from user space, which can even decide to
    supply no buffers at all (example: "xdpsock --txonly"). However, the bug
    is present also with the network stack code, even though it would take a
    very determined person to trigger a page allocation failure at the
    perfect time (a series of ifup/ifdown under memory pressure should
    eventually reproduce it given enough retries).

    net: do not sense pfmemalloc status in skb_append_pagefrags()
    
    [ Upstream commit 228ebc41dfab5b5d34cd76835ddb0ca8ee12f513 ]
    
    skb_append_pagefrags() is used by af_unix and udp sendpage()
    implementation so far.
    
    In commit 326140063946 ("tcp: TX zerocopy should not sense
    pfmemalloc status") we explained why we should not sense
    pfmemalloc status for pages owned by user space.
    
    We should also use skb_fill_page_desc_noacc()
    in skb_append_pagefrags() to avoid following KCSAN report:

    net/mlx5: Fix crash during sync firmware reset
    
    [ Upstream commit aefb62a9988749703435e941704624949a80a2a9 ]
    
    When setting Bluefield to DPU NIC mode using mlxconfig tool +  sync
    firmware reset flow, we run into scenario where the host was not
    eswitch manager at the time of mlx5 driver load but becomes eswitch manager
    after the sync firmware reset flow. This results in null pointer
    access of mpfs structure during mac filter add. This change prevents null
    pointer access but mpfs table entries will not be added.

    net/mlx5: Update fw fatal reporter state on PCI handlers successful recover
    
    [ Upstream commit 416ef713631937cf5452476a7f1041a3ae7b06c6 ]
    
    Update devlink health fw fatal reporter state to "healthy" is needed by
    strictly calling devlink_health_reporter_state_update() after recovery
    was done by PCI error handler. This is needed when fw_fatal reporter was
    triggered due to PCI error. Poll health is called and set reporter state
    to error. Health recovery failed (since EEH didn't re-enable the PCI).
    PCI handlers keep on recover flow and succeed later without devlink
    acknowledgment. Fix this by adding devlink state update at the end of
    the PCI handler recovery process.

    net/mlx5: Fix possible use-after-free in async command interface
    
    [ Upstream commit bacd22df95147ed673bec4692ab2d4d585935241 ]
    
    mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx should return only after all its callback
    handlers were completed. Before this patch, the below race between
    mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx and mlx5_cmd_exec_cb_handler was possible and
    lead to a use-after-free:
    
    1. mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx is called while num_inflight is 2 (i.e.
       elevated by 1, a single inflight callback).
    2. mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx decreases num_inflight to 1.
    3. mlx5_cmd_exec_cb_handler is called, decreases num_inflight to 0 and
       is about to call wake_up().
    4. mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx calls wait_event, which returns
       immediately as the condition (num_inflight == 0) holds.
    5. mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx returns.
    6. The caller of mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx frees the mlx5_async_ctx
       object.
    7. mlx5_cmd_exec_cb_handler goes on and calls wake_up() on the freed
       object.
    
    Fix it by syncing using a completion object. Mark it completed when
    num_inflight reaches 0.

    net/mlx5e: Extend SKB room check to include PTP-SQ
    
    [ Upstream commit 19b43a432e3e47db656a8269a74b50aef826950c ]
    
    When tx_port_ts is set, the driver diverts all UPD traffic over PTP port
    to a dedicated PTP-SQ. The SKBs are cached until the wire-CQE arrives.
    When the packet size is greater then MTU, the firmware might drop it and
    the packet won't be transmitted to the wire, hence the wire-CQE won't
    reach the driver. In this case the SKBs are accumulated in the SKB fifo.
    Add room check to consider the PTP-SQ SKB fifo, when the SKB fifo is
    full, driver stops the queue resulting in a TX timeout. Devlink
    TX-reporter can recover from it.

    net/mlx5e: Do not increment ESN when updating IPsec ESN state
    
    [ Upstream commit 888be6b279b7257b5f6e4c9527675bff0a335596 ]
    
    An offloaded SA stops receiving after about 2^32 + replay_window
    packets. For example, when SA reaches <seq-hi 0x1, seq 0x2c>, all
    subsequent packets get dropped with SA-icv-failure (integrity_failed).
    
    To reproduce the bug:
    - ConnectX-6 Dx with crypto enabled (FW 22.30.1004)
    - ipsec.conf:
      nic-offload = yes
      replay-window = 32
      esn = yes
      salifetime=24h
    - Run netperf for a long time to send more than 2^32 packets
      netperf -H <device-under-test> -t TCP_STREAM -l 20000
    
    When 2^32 + replay_window packets are received, the replay window
    moves from the 2nd half of subspace (overlap=1) to the 1st half
    (overlap=0). The driver then updates the 'esn' value in NIC
    (i.e. seq_hi) as follows.
    
     seq_hi = xfrm_replay_seqhi(seq_bottom)
     new esn in NIC = seq_hi + 1
    
    The +1 increment is wrong, as seq_hi already contains the correct
    seq_hi. For example, when seq_hi=1, the driver actually tells NIC to
    use seq_hi=2 (esn). This incorrect esn value causes all subsequent
    packets to fail integrity checks (SA-icv-failure). So, do not
    increment.

    As explained by Julian, fib_nh_scope is related to fib_nh_gw4, but

    [ Upstream commit e2badb4bd33abe13ddc35975bd7f7f8693955a4b ]
    
    The phylib callback is called after MAC driver's own resume callback is
    called. For AVE driver, after resuming immediately, PHY state machine is
    in PHY_NOLINK because there is a time lag from link-down to link-up due to
    autoneg. The result is WARN_ON() dump in mdio_bus_phy_resume().
    
    Since ave_resume() itself calls phy_resume(), AVE driver should manage
    PHY PM. To indicate that MAC driver manages PHY PM, set
    phydev->mac_managed_pm to true to avoid the unnecessary phylib call and
    add missing phy_init_hw() to ave_resume().

    i40e: Fix VF hang when reset is triggered on another VF
    
    [ Upstream commit 52424f974bc53c26ba3f00300a00e9de9afcd972 ]
    
    When a reset was triggered on one VF with i40e_reset_vf
    global PF state __I40E_VF_DISABLE was set on a PF until
    the reset finished. If immediately after triggering reset
    on one VF there is a request to reset on another
    it will cause a hang on VF side because VF will be notified
    of incoming reset but the reset will never happen because
    of this global state, we will get such error message:
    
    [  +4.890195] iavf 0000:86:02.1: Never saw reset
    
    and VF will hang waiting for the reset to be triggered.
    
    Fix this by introducing new VF state I40E_VF_STATE_RESETTING
    that will be set on a VF if it is currently resetting instead of
    the global __I40E_VF_DISABLE PF state.

    i40e: Fix ethtool rx-flow-hash setting for X722
    
    [ Upstream commit 54b5af5a438076082d482cab105b1bd484ab5074 ]
    
    When enabling flow type for RSS hash via ethtool:
    
    ethtool -N $pf rx-flow-hash tcp4|tcp6|udp4|udp6 s|d
    
    the driver would fail to setup this setting on X722
    device since it was using the mask on the register
    dedicated for X710 devices.
    
    Apply a different mask on the register when setting the
    RSS hash for the X722 device.
    
    When displaying the flow types enabled via ethtool:
    
    ethtool -n $pf rx-flow-hash tcp4|tcp6|udp4|udp6
    
    the driver would print wrong values for X722 device.
    
    Fix this issue by testing masks for X722 device in
    i40e_get_rss_hash_opts function.

    ipv6: ensure sane device mtu in tunnels
    
    [ Upstream commit d89d7ff01235f218dad37de84457717f699dee79 ]
    
    Another syzbot report [1] with no reproducer hints
    at a bug in ip6_gre tunnel (dev:ip6gretap0)
    
    Since ipv6 mcast code makes sure to read dev->mtu once
    and applies a sanity check on it (see commit b9b312a7a451
    "ipv6: mcast: better catch silly mtu values"), a remaining
    possibility is that a layer is able to set dev->mtu to
    an underflowed value (high order bit set).
    
    This could happen indeed in ip6gre_tnl_link_config_route(),
    ip6_tnl_link_config() and ipip6_tunnel_bind_dev()
    
    Make sure to sanitize mtu value in a local variable before
    it is written once on dev->mtu, as lockless readers could
    catch wrong temporary value.

    perf vendor events power10: Fix hv-24x7 metric events
    
    [ Upstream commit b92dd11725a7c57f55e148c7d3ce58a86f480575 ]
    
    Testcase stat_all_metrics.sh fails in powerpc:
    
      90: perf all metrics test : FAILED!
    
    The testcase "stat_all_metrics.sh" verifies perf stat result for all the
    metric events present in perf list.  It runs perf metric events with
    various commands and expects non-empty metric result.
    
    Incase of powerpc:hv-24x7 events, some of the event count can be 0 based
    on system configuration. And if that event used as denominator in divide
    equation, it can cause divide by 0 error. The current nest_metric.json
    file creating divide by 0 issue for some of the metric events, which
    results in failure of the "stat_all_metrics.sh" test case.
    
    Most of the metrics events have cycles or an event which expect to have
    a larger value as denominator, so adding 1 to the denominator of the
    metric expression as a fix.
    
    Result in powerpc box after this patch changes:
    
      90: perf all metrics test : Ok

    net-memcg: avoid stalls when under memory pressure
    
    [ Upstream commit 720ca52bcef225b967a339e0fffb6d0c7e962240 ]
    
    As Shakeel explains the commit under Fixes had the unintended
    side-effect of no longer pre-loading the cached memory allowance.
    Even tho we previously dropped the first packet received when
    over memory limit - the consecutive ones would get thru by using
    the cache. The charging was happening in batches of 128kB, so
    we'd let in 128kB (truesize) worth of packets per one drop.
    
    After the change we no longer force charge, there will be no
    cache filling side effects. This causes significant drops and
    connection stalls for workloads which use a lot of page cache,
    since we can't reclaim page cache under GFP_NOWAIT.
    
    Some of the latency can be recovered by improving SACK reneg
    handling but nowhere near enough to get back to the pre-5.15
    performance (the application I'm experimenting with still
    sees 5-10x worst latency).
    
    Apply the suggested workaround of using GFP_ATOMIC. We will now
    be more permissive than previously as we'll drop _no_ packets
    in softirq when under pressure. But I can't think of any good
    and simple way to address that within networking.

    tcp: fix indefinite deferral of RTO with SACK reneging
    
    [ Upstream commit 3d2af9cce3133b3bc596a9d065c6f9d93419ccfb ]
    
    This commit fixes a bug that can cause a TCP data sender to repeatedly
    defer RTOs when encountering SACK reneging.
    
    The bug is that when we're in fast recovery in a scenario with SACK
    reneging, every time we get an ACK we call tcp_check_sack_reneging()
    and it can note the apparent SACK reneging and rearm the RTO timer for
    srtt/2 into the future. In some SACK reneging scenarios that can
    happen repeatedly until the receive window fills up, at which point
    the sender can't send any more, the ACKs stop arriving, and the RTO
    fires at srtt/2 after the last ACK. But that can take far too long
    (O(10 secs)), since the connection is stuck in fast recovery with a
    low cwnd that cannot grow beyond ssthresh, even if more bandwidth is
    available.
    
    This fix changes the logic in tcp_check_sack_reneging() to only rearm
    the RTO timer if data is cumulatively ACKed, indicating forward
    progress. This avoids this kind of nearly infinite loop of RTO timer
    re-arming. In addition, this meets the goals of
    tcp_check_sack_reneging() in handling Windows TCP behavior that looks
    temporarily like SACK reneging but is not really.
    
    Many thanks to Jakub Kicinski and Neil Spring, who reported this issue
    and provided critical packet traces that enabled root-causing this
    issue. Also, many thanks to Jakub Kicinski for testing this fix.

    tcp: fix a signed-integer-overflow bug in tcp_add_backlog()
    
    [ Upstream commit ec791d8149ff60c40ad2074af3b92a39c916a03f ]
    
    The type of sk_rcvbuf and sk_sndbuf in struct sock is int, and
    in tcp_add_backlog(), the variable limit is caculated by adding
    sk_rcvbuf, sk_sndbuf and 64 * 1024, it may exceed the max value
    of int and overflow. This patch reduces the limit budget by
    halving the sndbuf to solve this issue since ACK packets are much
    smaller than the payload.

    net: fix UAF issue in nfqnl_nf_hook_drop() when ops_init() failed
    
    [ Upstream commit d266935ac43d57586e311a087510fe6a084af742 ]
    
    When the ops_init() interface is invoked to initialize the net, but
    ops->init() fails, data is released. However, the ptr pointer in
    net->gen is invalid. In this case, when nfqnl_nf_hook_drop() is invoked
    to release the net, invalid address access occurs.
    
    The process is as follows:
    setup_net()
            ops_init()
                    data = kzalloc(...)   ---> alloc "data"
                    net_assign_generic()  ---> assign "date" to ptr in net->gen
                    ...
                    ops->init()           ---> failed
                    ...
                    kfree(data);          ---> ptr in net->gen is invalid
            ...
            ops_exit_list()
                    ...

    atlantic: fix deadlock at aq_nic_stop
    
    [ Upstream commit 6960d133f66ecddcd3af2b1cbd0c7dcd104268b8 ]
    
    NIC is stopped with rtnl_lock held, and during the stop it cancels the
    'service_task' work and free irqs.
    
    However, if CONFIG_MACSEC is set, rtnl_lock is acquired both from
    aq_nic_service_task and aq_linkstate_threaded_isr. Then a deadlock
    happens if aq_nic_stop tries to cancel/disable them when they've already
    started their execution.
    
    As the deadlock is caused by rtnl_lock, it causes many other processes
    to stall, not only atlantic related stuff.
    
    Fix it by introducing a mutex that protects each NIC's macsec related
    data, and locking it instead of the rtnl_lock from the service task and
    the threaded IRQ.
    
    Before this patch, all macsec data was protected with rtnl_lock, but
    maybe not all of it needs to be protected. With this new mutex, further
    efforts can be made to limit the protected data only to that which
    requires it. However, probably it doesn't worth it because all macsec's
    data accesses are infrequent, and almost all are done from macsec_ops
    or ethtool callbacks, called holding rtnl_lock, so macsec_mutex won't
    never be much contended.
    
    The issue appeared repeteadly attaching and deattaching the NIC to a
    bond interface. Doing that after this patch I cannot reproduce the bug.

    amd-xgbe: add the bit rate quirk for Molex cables
    
    [ Upstream commit 170a9e341a3b02c0b2ea0df16ef14a33a4f41de8 ]
    
    The offset 12 (bit-rate) of EEPROM SFP DAC (passive) cables is expected
    to be in the range 0x64 to 0x68. However, the 5 meter and 7 meter Molex
    passive cables have the rate ceiling 0x78 at offset 12.
    
    Add a quirk for Molex passive cables to extend the rate ceiling to 0x78.

    amd-xgbe: fix the SFP compliance codes check for DAC cables
    
    [ Upstream commit 09c5f6bf11ac98874339e55f4f5f79a9dbc9b375 ]
    
    The current XGBE code assumes that offset 6 of EEPROM SFP DAC (passive)
    cables is NULL. However, some cables (the 5 meter and 7 meter Molex
    passive cables) have non-zero data at offset 6. Fix the logic by moving
    the passive cable check above the active checks, so as not to be
    improperly identified as an active cable. This will fix the issue for
    any passive cable that advertises 1000Base-CX in offset 6.

    x86/unwind/orc: Fix unreliable stack dump with gcov
    
    [ Upstream commit 230db82413c091bc16acee72650f48d419cebe49 ]
    
    When a console stack dump is initiated with CONFIG_GCOV_PROFILE_ALL
    enabled, show_trace_log_lvl() gets out of sync with the ORC unwinder,
    causing the stack trace to show all text addresses as unreliable:

    This happens when the compiled code for show_stack() has a single word
    on the stack, and doesn't use a tail call to show_stack_log_lvl().
    (CONFIG_GCOV_PROFILE_ALL=y is the only known case of this.)  Then the
    __unwind_start() skip logic hits an off-by-one bug and fails to unwind
    all the way to the intended starting frame.
    
    Fix it by reverting the following commit:
    
      f1d9a2abff66 ("x86/unwind/orc: Don't skip the first frame for inactive tasks")
    
    The original justification for that commit no longer exists.  That
    original issue was later fixed in a different way, with the following
    commit:
    
      f2ac57a4c49d ("x86/unwind/orc: Fix inactive tasks with stack pointer in %sp on GCC 10 compiled kernels")

    net: macb: Specify PHY PM management done by MAC
    
    [ Upstream commit 15a9dbec631cd69dfbbfc4e2cbf90c9dd8432a8f ]
    
    The `macb_resume`/`macb_suspend` methods already call the
    `phylink_start`/`phylink_stop` methods during their execution so
    explicitly say that the PM of the PHY is done by MAC by using the
    `mac_managed_pm` flag of the `struct phylink_config`.
    
    This also fixes the warning message issued during resume:

    It was caused by srv->listener that might be set to null by
    tipc_topsrv_stop() in net .exit whereas it's still used in
    tipc_topsrv_accept() worker.
    
    srv->listener is protected by srv->idr_lock in tipc_topsrv_stop(), so add
    a check for srv->listener under srv->idr_lock in tipc_topsrv_accept() to
    avoid the null-ptr-deref. To ensure the lsock is not released during the
    tipc_topsrv_accept(), move sock_release() after tipc_topsrv_work_stop()
    where it's waiting until the tipc_topsrv_accept worker to be done.
    
    Note that sk_callback_lock is used to protect sk->sk_user_data instead of
    srv->listener, and it should check srv in tipc_topsrv_listener_data_ready()
    instead. This also ensures that no more tipc_topsrv_accept worker will be
    started after tipc_conn_close() is called in tipc_topsrv_stop() where it
    sets sk->sk_user_data to null.

    perf: Fix missing SIGTRAPs
    
    [ Upstream commit ca6c21327c6af02b7eec31ce4b9a740a18c6c13f ]
    
    Marco reported:
    
    Due to the implementation of how SIGTRAP are delivered if
    perf_event_attr::sigtrap is set, we've noticed 3 issues:
    
      1. Missing SIGTRAP due to a race with event_sched_out() (more
         details below).
    
      2. Hardware PMU events being disabled due to returning 1 from
         perf_event_overflow(). The only way to re-enable the event is
         for user space to first "properly" disable the event and then
         re-enable it.
    
      3. The inability to automatically disable an event after a
         specified number of overflows via PERF_EVENT_IOC_REFRESH.
    
    The worst of the 3 issues is problem (1), which occurs when a
    pending_disable is "consumed" by a racing event_sched_out(), observed
    as follows:
    
                    CPU0                    |       CPU1
            --------------------------------+---------------------------
            __perf_event_overflow()         |
             perf_event_disable_inatomic()  |
              pending_disable = CPU0        | ...
                                            | _perf_event_enable()
                                            |  event_function_call()
                                            |   task_function_call()
                                            |    /* sends IPI to CPU0 */
            <IPI>                           | ...
             __perf_event_enable()          +---------------------------
              ctx_resched()
               task_ctx_sched_out()
                ctx_sched_out()
                 group_sched_out()
                  event_sched_out()
                   pending_disable = -1
            </IPI>
            <IRQ-work>
             perf_pending_event()
              perf_pending_event_disable()
               /* Fails to send SIGTRAP because no pending_disable! */
            </IRQ-work>
    
    In the above case, not only is that particular SIGTRAP missed, but also
    all future SIGTRAPs because 'event_limit' is not reset back to 1.
    
    To fix, rework pending delivery of SIGTRAP via IRQ-work by introduction
    of a separate 'pending_sigtrap', no longer using 'event_limit' and
    'pending_disable' for its delivery.
    
    Additionally; and different to Marco's proposed patch:
    
     - recognise that pending_disable effectively duplicates oncpu for
       the case where it is set. As such, change the irq_work handler to
       use ->oncpu to target the event and use pending_* as boolean toggles.
    
     - observe that SIGTRAP targets the ctx->task, so the context switch
       optimization that carries contexts between tasks is invalid. If
       the irq_work were delayed enough to hit after a context switch the
       SIGTRAP would be delivered to the wrong task.
    
     - observe that if the event gets scheduled out
       (rotation/migration/context-switch/...) the irq-work would be
       insufficient to deliver the SIGTRAP when the event gets scheduled
       back in (the irq-work might still be pending on the old CPU).
    
       Therefore have event_sched_out() convert the pending sigtrap into a
       task_work which will deliver the signal at return_to_user.

    This update is required to fix no display and no sound issue observed
    after reconnecting TAMA/SANWA DP cables.
    Once DP cable is unplugged, DMA control registers are being reset by
    hardware, however at second plugin, new dma control values does not
    updated to the dma hardware registers since new register value and
    cached values at the time of first plugin are same.

    KVM: selftests: Fix number of pages for memory slot in memslot_modification_stress_test
    
    [ Upstream commit 05c2224d4b049406b0545a10be05280ff4b8ba0a ]
    
    It's required by vm_userspace_mem_region_add() that memory size
    should be aligned to host page size. However, one guest page is
    provided by memslot_modification_stress_test. It triggers failure
    in the scenario of 64KB-page-size-host and 4KB-page-size-guest,
    as the following messages indicate.

    drm/msm: Fix return type of mdp4_lvds_connector_mode_valid
    
    [ Upstream commit 0b33a33bd15d5bab73b87152b220a8d0153a4587 ]
    
    The mode_valid field in drm_connector_helper_funcs is expected to be of
    type:
    enum drm_mode_status (* mode_valid) (struct drm_connector *connector,
                                         struct drm_display_mode *mode);
    
    The mismatched return type breaks forward edge kCFI since the underlying
    function definition does not match the function hook definition.
    
    The return type of mdp4_lvds_connector_mode_valid should be changed from
    int to enum drm_mode_status.

    mmc: block: Remove error check of hw_reset on reset
    
    commit 406e14808ee695cbae1eafa5fd3ac563c29470ab upstream.
    
    Before switching back to the right partition in mmc_blk_reset there used
    to be a check if hw_reset was even supported. This return value
    was removed, so there is no reason to check. Furthermore ensure
    part_curr is not falsely set to a valid value on reset or
    partition switch error.
    
    As part of this change the code paths of mmc_blk_reset calls were checked
    to ensure no commands are issued after a failed mmc_blk_reset directly
    without going through the block layer.

    LTS 5.15 pulled in several lpfc "SLI Path split" patches.  The Path
    Split mods were a 14-patch set, which refactors the driver from
    to split the sli-3 hw (now eol) from the sli-4 hw and use sli4
    structures natively. The patches are highly inter-related.
    
    Given only some of the patches were included, it created a situation
    where FLOGI's fail, thus SLI Ports can't start communication.
    
    Reverting this patch as its one of the partial Path Split patches
    that was included.

    Revert "scsi: lpfc: SLI path split: Refactor fast and slow paths to native SLI4"
    
    This reverts commit c56cc7fefc3159049f94fb1318e48aa60cabf703.
    
    LTS 5.15 pulled in several lpfc "SLI Path split" patches.  The Path
    Split mods were a 14-patch set, which refactors the driver from
    to split the sli-3 hw (now eol) from the sli-4 hw and use sli4
    structures natively. The patches are highly inter-related.
    
    Given only some of the patches were included, it created a situation
    where FLOGI's fail, thus SLI Ports can't start communication.
    
    Reverting this patch as its one of the partial Path Split patches
    that was included.

    ARC: mm: fix leakage of memory allocated for PTE
    
    commit 4fd9df10cb7a9289fbd22d669f9f98164d95a1ce upstream.
    
    Since commit d9820ff ("ARC: mm: switch pgtable_t back to struct page *")
    a memory leakage problem occurs. Memory allocated for page table entries
    not released during process termination. This issue can be reproduced by
    a small program that allocates a large amount of memory. After several
    runs, you'll see that the amount of free memory has reduced and will
    continue to reduce after each run. All ARC CPUs are effected by this
    issue. The issue was introduced since the kernel stable release v5.15-rc1.
    
    As described in commit d9820ff after switch pgtable_t back to struct
    page *, a pointer to "struct page" and appropriate functions are used to
    allocate and free a memory page for PTEs, but the pmd_pgtable macro hasn't
    changed and returns the direct virtual address from the PMD (PGD) entry.
    Than this address used as a parameter in the __pte_free() and as a result
    this function couldn't release memory page allocated for PTEs.
    
    Fix this issue by changing the pmd_pgtable macro and returning pointer to
    struct page.

    kernfs: fix use-after-free in __kernfs_remove
    
    commit 4abc99652812a2ddf932f137515d5c5a04723538 upstream.
    
    Syzkaller managed to trigger concurrent calls to
    kernfs_remove_by_name_ns() for the same file resulting in
    a KASAN detected use-after-free. The race occurs when the root
    node is freed during kernfs_drain().
    
    To prevent this acquire an additional reference for the root
    of the tree that is removed before calling __kernfs_remove().
    
    Found by syzkaller with the following reproducer (slab_nomerge is
    required):
    
    syz_mount_image$ext4(0x0, &(0x7f0000000100)='./file0\x00', 0x100000, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)
    r0 = openat(0xffffffffffffff9c, &(0x7f0000000080)='/proc/self/exe\x00', 0x0, 0x0)
    close(r0)
    pipe2(&(0x7f0000000140)={0xffffffffffffffff, <r1=>0xffffffffffffffff}, 0x800)
    mount$9p_fd(0x0, &(0x7f0000000040)='./file0\x00', &(0x7f00000000c0), 0x408, &(0x7f0000000280)={'trans=fd,', {'rfdno', 0x3d, r0}, 0x2c, {'wfdno', 0x3d, r1}, 0x2c, {[{@cache_loose}, {@mmap}, {@loose}, {@loose}, {@mmap}], [{@mask={'mask', 0x3d, '^MAY_EXEC'}}, {@fsmagic={'fsmagic', 0x3d, 0x10001}}, {@dont_hash}]}})

    commit d917a62af81b133f35f627e7936e193c842a7947 upstream.
    
    The signal_read(), action_read(), and action_write() callbacks have been
    assuming Signal0 is requested without checking. This results in requests
    for Signal1 returning data for Signal0. This patch fixes these
    oversights by properly checking for the Signal's id in the respective
    callbacks and handling accordingly based on the particular Signal
    requested. The trig_inverted member of the mchp_tc_data is removed as
    superfluous.

    commit 9dc0033e4658d6f9d9952c3c0c6be3ec25bc2985 upstream.
    
    Enhanced Strobe (ES) does not work correctly on the ASUS 1100 series of
    devices. Jasper Lake eMMCs (pci_id 8086:4dc4) are supposed to support
    ES. There are also two system families under the series, thus this is
    being scoped to the ASUS BIOS.
    
    The failing ES prevents the installer from writing to disk. Falling back
    to HS400 without ES fixes the issue.

    SDIO tuple is only allocated for standard SDIO card, especially it causes

    is because the card device's reference counter does not increase for it at

    coresight: cti: Fix hang in cti_disable_hw()
    
    commit 6746eae4bbaddcc16b40efb33dab79210828b3ce upstream.
    
    cti_enable_hw() and cti_disable_hw() are called from an atomic context
    so shouldn't use runtime PM because it can result in a sleep when
    communicating with firmware.
    
    Since commit 3c6656337852 ("Revert "firmware: arm_scmi: Add clock
    management to the SCMI power domain""), this causes a hang on Juno when
    running the Perf Coresight tests or running this command:
    
      perf record -e cs_etm//u -- ls
    
    This was also missed until the revert commit because pm_runtime_put()
    was called with the wrong device until commit 692c9a499b28 ("coresight:
    cti: Correct the parameter for pm_runtime_put")
    
    With lock and scheduler debugging enabled the following is output:
    
       coresight cti_sys0: cti_enable_hw -- dev:cti_sys0  parent: 20020000.cti

    drm/msm/dp: fix IRQ lifetime
    
    commit a79343dcaba4b11adb57350e0b6426906a9b658e upstream.
    
    Device-managed resources allocated post component bind must be tied to
    the lifetime of the aggregate DRM device or they will not necessarily be
    released when binding of the aggregate device is deferred.
    
    This is specifically true for the DP IRQ, which will otherwise remain
    requested so that the next bind attempt fails when requesting the IRQ a
    second time.
    
    Since commit c3bf8e21b38a ("drm/msm/dp: Add eDP support via aux_bus")
    this can happen when the aux-bus panel driver has not yet been loaded so
    that probe is deferred.
    
    Fix this by tying the device-managed lifetime of the DP IRQ to the DRM
    device so that it is released when bind fails.

    some IP blocks will be likely to reinitialize at gfxoff entry and that

    scsi: qla2xxx: Use transport-defined speed mask for supported_speeds
    
    commit 0b863257c17c5f57a41e0a48de140ed026957a63 upstream.
    
    One of the sysfs values reported for supported_speeds was not valid (20Gb/s
    reported instead of 64Gb/s).  Instead of driver internal speed mask
    definition, use speed mask defined in transport_fc for reporting
    host->supported_speeds.

    mac802154: Fix LQI recording
    
    commit 5a5c4e06fd03b595542d5590f2bc05a6b7fc5c2b upstream.
    
    Back in 2014, the LQI was saved in the skb control buffer (skb->cb, or
    mac_cb(skb)) without any actual reset of this area prior to its use.
    
    As part of a useful rework of the use of this region, 32edc40ae65c
    ("ieee802154: change _cb handling slightly") introduced mac_cb_init() to
    basically memset the cb field to 0. In particular, this new function got
    called at the beginning of mac802154_parse_frame_start(), right before
    the location where the buffer got actually filled.
    
    What went through unnoticed however, is the fact that the very first
    helper called by device drivers in the receive path already used this
    area to save the LQI value for later extraction. Resetting the cb field
    "so late" led to systematically zeroing the LQI.
    
    If we consider the reset of the cb field needed, we can make it as soon
    as we get an skb from a device driver, right before storing the LQI,
    as is the very first time we need to write something there.

    cpufreq: intel_pstate: hybrid: Use known scaling factor for P-cores
    
    commit f5c8cf2a4992dd929fa0c2f25c09ee69b8dcbce1 upstream.
    
    Commit 46573fd6369f ("cpufreq: intel_pstate: hybrid: Rework HWP
    calibration") attempted to use the information from CPPC (the nominal
    performance in particular) to obtain the scaling factor allowing the
    frequency to be computed if the HWP performance level of the given CPU
    is known or vice versa.
    
    However, it turns out that on some platforms this doesn't work, because
    the CPPC information on them does not align with the contents of the
    MSR_HWP_CAPABILITIES registers.
    
    This basically means that the only way to make intel_pstate work on all
    of the hybrid platforms to date is to use the observation that on all
    of them the scaling factor between the HWP performance levels and
    frequency for P-cores is 78741 (approximately 100000/1.27).  For
    E-cores it is 100000, which is the same as for all of the non-hybrid
    "core" platforms and does not require any changes.
    
    Accordingly, make intel_pstate use 78741 as the scaling factor between
    HWP performance levels and frequency for P-cores on all hybrid platforms
    and drop the dependency of the HWP calibration code on CPPC.

    cpufreq: intel_pstate: Read all MSRs on the target CPU
    
    commit 8dbab94d45fb1094cefac7956b7fb987a36e2b12 upstream.
    
    Some of the MSR accesses in intel_pstate are carried out on the CPU
    that is running the code, but the values coming from them are used
    for the performance scaling of the other CPUs.
    
    This is problematic, for example, on hybrid platforms where
    MSR_TURBO_RATIO_LIMIT for P-cores and E-cores is different, so the
    values read from it on a P-core are generally not applicable to E-cores
    and the other way around.
    
    For this reason, make the driver access all MSRs on the target CPU on
    platforms using the "core" pstate_funcs callbacks which is the case for
    all of the hybrid platforms released to date.  For this purpose, pass
    a CPU argument to the ->get_max(), ->get_max_physical(), ->get_min()
    and ->get_turbo() pstate_funcs callbacks and from there pass it to
    rdmsrl_on_cpu() or rdmsrl_safe_on_cpu() to access the MSR on the target
    CPU.

    iio: adxl372: Fix unsafe buffer attributes
    
    commit ab0ee36e90f611f32c3a53afe9dc743de48138e2 upstream.
    
    The iio_triggered_buffer_setup_ext() was changed by
    commit 15097c7a1adc ("iio: buffer: wrap all buffer attributes into iio_dev_attr")
    to silently expect that all attributes given in buffer_attrs array are
    device-attributes. This expectation was not forced by the API - and some
    drivers did register attributes created by IIO_CONST_ATTR().
    
    The added attribute "wrapping" does not copy the pointer to stored
    string constant and when the sysfs file is read the kernel will access
    to invalid location.
    
    Change the IIO_CONST_ATTRs from the driver to IIO_DEVICE_ATTR in order
    to prevent the invalid memory access.

    xhci: Remove device endpoints from bandwidth list when freeing the device
    
    commit 5aed5b7c2430ce318a8e62f752f181e66f0d1053 upstream.
    
    Endpoints are normally deleted from the bandwidth list when they are
    dropped, before the virt device is freed.
    
    If xHC host is dying or being removed then the endpoints aren't dropped
    cleanly due to functions returning early to avoid interacting with a
    non-accessible host controller.
    
    So check and delete endpoints that are still on the bandwidth list when
    freeing the virt device.
    
    Solves a list_del corruption kernel crash when unbinding xhci-pci,
    caused by xhci_mem_cleanup() when it later tried to delete already freed
    endpoints from the bandwidth list.
    
    This only affects hosts that use software bandwidth checking, which
    currenty is only the xHC in intel Panther Point PCH (Ivy Bridge)

    xhci-pci: Set runtime PM as default policy on all xHC 1.2 or later devices
    
    commit a611bf473d1f77b70f7188b5577542cb39b4701b upstream.
    
    For optimal power consumption of USB4 routers the XHCI PCIe endpoint
    used for tunneling must be in D3.  Historically this is accomplished
    by a long list of PCIe IDs that correspond to these endpoints because
    the xhci_hcd driver will not default to allowing runtime PM for all
    devices.
    
    As both AMD and Intel have released new products with new XHCI controllers
    this list continues to grow. In reviewing the XHCI specification v1.2 on
    page 607 there is already a requirement that the PCI power management
    states D3hot and D3cold must be supported.
    
    In the quirk list, use this to indicate that runtime PM should be allowed
    on XHCI controllers. The following controllers are known to be xHC 1.2 and
    dropped explicitly:
    * AMD Yellow Carp
    * Intel Alder Lake
    * Intel Meteor Lake
    * Intel Raptor Lake

    xhci: Add quirk to reset host back to default state at shutdown
    
    commit 34cd2db408d591bc15771cbcc90939ade0a99a21 upstream.
    
    Systems based on Alder Lake P see significant boot time delay if
    boot firmware tries to control usb ports in unexpected link states.
    
    This is seen with self-powered usb devices that survive in U3 link
    suspended state over S5.
    
    A more generic solution to power off ports at shutdown was attempted in
    commit 83810f84ecf1 ("xhci: turn off port power in shutdown")
    but it caused regression.
    
    Add host specific XHCI_RESET_TO_DEFAULT quirk which will reset host and
    ports back to default state in shutdown.

    mtd: rawnand: marvell: Use correct logic for nand-keep-config
    
    commit ce107713b722af57c4b7f2477594d445b496420e upstream.
    
    Originally the absence of the marvell,nand-keep-config property caused
    the setup_data_interface function to be provided. However when
    setup_data_interface was moved into nand_controller_ops the logic was
    unintentionally inverted. Update the logic so that only if the
    marvell,nand-keep-config property is present the bootloader NAND config
    kept.

    usb: xhci: add XHCI_SPURIOUS_SUCCESS to ASM1042 despite being a V0.96 controller
    
    commit 4f547472380136718b56064ea5689a61e135f904 upstream.
    
    This appears to fix the error:
    "xhci_hcd <address>; ERROR Transfer event TRB DMA ptr not part of
    current TD ep_index 2 comp_code 13" that appear spuriously (or pretty
    often) when using a r8152 USB3 ethernet adapter with integrated hub.
    
    ASM1042 reports as a 0.96 controller, but appears to behave more like 1.0

    controller driver respect that. That is, don't set IMI (Interrupt on
    Missed Isoc) when usb_request->no_interrupt is set. Also, the driver
    should only set IMI to the last TRB of a chain.

    commit f78961f8380b940e0cfc7e549336c21a2ad44f4d upstream.
    
    When servicing a transfer completion event, the dwc3 driver will reclaim
    TRBs of started requests up to the request associated with the interrupt
    event. Currently we don't check for interrupt due to missed isoc, and
    the driver may attempt to reclaim TRBs beyond the associated event. This
    causes invalid memory access when the hardware still owns the TRB. If
    there's a missed isoc TRB with IMI (interrupt on missed isoc), make sure
    to stop servicing further.
    
    Note that only the last TRB of chained TRBs has its status updated with
    missed isoc.

    causing a memory fault as subsequent requests for that buffer are still

    USB: add RESET_RESUME quirk for NVIDIA Jetson devices in RCM
    
    commit fc4ade55c617dc73c7e9756b57f3230b4ff24540 upstream.
    
    NVIDIA Jetson devices in Force Recovery mode (RCM) do not support
    suspending, ie. flashing fails if the device has been suspended. The
    devices are still visible in lsusb and seem to work otherwise, making
    the issue hard to debug. This has been discovered in various forum
    posts, eg. [1].
    
    The patch has been tested on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, but I'm adding
    all the Jetson models listed in [2] on the assumption that they all
    behave similarly.

    ALSA: Use del_timer_sync() before freeing timer
    
    commit f0a868788fcbf63cdab51f5adcf73b271ede8164 upstream.
    
    The current code for freeing the emux timer is extremely dangerous:
    
      CPU0                          CPU1
      ----                          ----
    snd_emux_timer_callback()
                                snd_emux_free()
                                  spin_lock(&emu->voice_lock)
                                  del_timer(&emu->tlist); <-- returns immediately
                                  spin_unlock(&emu->voice_lock);
                                  [..]
                                  kfree(emu);
    
      spin_lock(&emu->voice_lock);
    
     [BOOM!]
    
    Instead just use del_timer_sync() which will wait for the timer to finish
    before continuing. No need to check if the timer is active or not when
    doing so.
    
    This doesn't fix the race of a possible re-arming of the timer, but at
    least it won't use the data that has just been freed.

    can: kvaser_usb: Fix possible completions during init_completion
    
    commit 2871edb32f4622c3a25ce4b3977bad9050b91974 upstream.
    
    kvaser_usb uses completions to signal when a response event is received
    for outgoing commands.
    
    However, it uses init_completion() to reinitialize the start_comp and
    stop_comp completions before sending the start/stop commands.
    
    In case the device sends the corresponding response just before the
    actual command is sent, complete() may be called concurrently with
    init_completion() which is not safe.
    
    This might be triggerable even with a properly functioning device by
    stopping the interface (CMD_STOP_CHIP) just after it goes bus-off (which
    also causes the driver to send CMD_STOP_CHIP when restart-ms is off),
    but that was not tested.
    
    Fix the issue by using reinit_completion() instead.

    NFSv4: Fix free of uninitialized nfs4_label on referral lookup.
    
    commit c3ed222745d9ad7b69299b349a64ba533c64a34f upstream.
    
    Send along the already-allocated fattr along with nfs4_fs_locations, and
    drop the memcpy of fattr.  We end up growing two more allocations, but this
    fixes up a crash as:
