# Disagreements between annotators

This folder has the content of the session where the annotators (Abhishek, Michel and David) talked about their annotations and they (maybe) decided to change the annotations:

## First round

Annotators will discuss the disagreement they had annotating the commits, then they decide if the want to change the annotation of those commits. Those files should have the name `<annotator_name>_first_round.csv`.

- Disagreement on BPC, BFC, PRC, and NFC. When the difference is at least 1.


## Second round

On the commits that already there is a disagreement, the authors should check Jes√∫s reviews of those commits and then annotate them again. Those files should have the name `<annotator_name>_second_round.csv`.


## Third round (TBD)

Add ML/AI annotations and compare
