16b1941eac,jesus,4,True,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,3.0,False,"INFO. This seems like a clear BFC, triggered by an automated tool (A fuzzer). It could be a safety-related bug, since a variable is used after being freed, which in principle could have unintended consequences.

This said, it is interesting this sentence in the commit message: ""The race wouldn't occur if the gadget core registered its devices on a real bus, using the standard synchronization techniques of the driver core."" Reading the complete message, the bug manifests in the gadget core (this is in the USB subsystem) because it is not using the ""standard synchronization techniques provided by the driver core"". However, the bug is fixed not in the gadget core, but in the driver core, thus preventing bugs caused by other gadgets that could not be using those standard techniques."
7a70d9a1cf,jesus,4,True,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0.0,False,"INFO. There are two things addressed in this commit. One is checking if the needed hw is present, which seems to be a perfective commit, PRC since it really doesn't fix or prevent a malfunction, except for the log message, which in any case would be correct (stating that hw is not available). The other one is fixing dependency information, which could cause a bug (no report is provided), and is thus a BPC."
09e7af76db,jesus,4,True,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,False,"This commit is preventing a non-reported bug: ""As the potential failure of the clk_enable(), it should be better to check it and return error if fails."""
dca4f5fdbc,jesus,4,True,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4.0,False,"INFO: Bug preventing commit. Uses a pre-defined helper, instead of some specific code, which could trigger bugs. In part, the commit is triggered by a warning, thus ASC.

Interesting that some annotators think this is a PRC (maybe because the use of a helper being a kind of refactoring?). I'm not labeling as PRC because in my opinion, the refactoring is at the service of fixing the potential bug, and is not a refactoring without an impact on behavior (now, some bugs are prevented, but nothing else changed)."
dd2319c618,jesus,4,True,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4.0,True,"INFO. Bug preventing commit: some new annotations are included, to ensure that a warning is triggered if possible null pointers dereferences are detected. No specific bug is fixed, but the action intends to help in detecting (and hopefully fixing) bugs in vendor modules.

Interesting that, despite being in agreement with this diagnostics, two annotators still give a large mark (3, 4) to BFC."
ec80906b0f,jesus,4,True,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0.0,False,"INFO. Fixing errors in tests. I think this can be considered a PRC, since it improves the code, but does not impact on functionality.

It seems that the annotator who labeled this as BFC didn't notice the fix was in a test."
2703c16c75,jesus,4,True,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0.0,True,"This is a part of a large chunk of new code to support (or better support) Compute Express Link (CXL) . As seen in the description of v0 of the patchset [1]: ""Two new drivers are introduced to support Compute Express Link 2.0 [2] HDM decoder enumeration [...] cxl_port [...] cxl_port."" In particular, the commit main purpose is to ""provide a common mechanism for a CXL.mem endpoint driver to enumerate all the ancestor CXL ports in the topology and validate CXL.mem connectivity."" So, I think this is clearly a NFC, part of a large new functionality patchset. Even when the specification could be changing in part to allow for this new implementation, that's not done in this commit.

Curiously enough, none of the annotators saw it that way... Maybe I'm wrong?

9995c1d096,jesus,4,True,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0.0,True,"INFO. This commit doesn't seem to fix any bug, or prevent any bug. It is improving the implementation of a specific case, as was suggested by reviewers of a previous commit. From this point of view, it seems it is a PRC. There could be reasons for considering it a NFC, because the commit comment says: ""This would allow for a more consistent resource management for platforms where PAUSE and STOP are handled differently"", which may imply that some new functionality is being added for that kind of platforms. But I find this case to be weak enough to still consider the bug as a PRC.

However, this could be an interesting example for defining where ""perfective commits"" end (in general, they are assumed to not change functionality: does this commit change it?), and where ""new feature"" starts (in this case, it could be that supporting those platforms where PAUSE and STOP and handled differently is enough of a reason to consider it as a new feature?"
7cbeeb0553,jesus,4,True,0,4,0,0,4,0,0,4.0,False,"INFO. This is a bug prevention commit, to fix a warning raised by the compiler. As in other cases, this could be just refactoring (changing the type of a variable), but I tend to consider this as a help for catching future bugs, and therefore BPC. There is room for discussion, anyway."
a3b774342f,jesus,4,True,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,4.0,False,"INFO. This fixes an error, by not detecting shift values that are too large.

Annotators tend to think it is more a BPC than a BFC. Again, this could be a sympthom of drawing better the line between both, or that there are shadows of grey...

The error is detected by specific code in the kernel (the error is shown in the commit message, thus this is also an ASC."
403d50341c,jesus,3,True,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4.0,False,"Fixes a problem in a function for copying memory, by having into account some offsets. Seem to fix a bug, which would happen when those offsets are not considered, although I'm not 100% sure I correctly understand the patch."
9f22f95951,jesus,4,True,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0.0,True,"INFO. Specific config info for two cameras, which ""don't implement the power line correctly"". This could be a bug (those cameras were not well supported), but also a new feature, since likely those two cameras were not supported at all, and are supported now. Again, this is a matter of deciding if those two cameras were in-specs or off-specs before this commit. Let's assume they were off-specs (in principle, the previous code was correct, in the sense it supported all other supported cameras), and this commit is putting these cameras in-specs, and at the same time, supporting them.

In addition, this commit is part of a patchset [1] which states: ""The goal is still to support the UVC 1.5 power line frequency control extra option (patch 1/7), and work around an issue with devices that do not implement support for disabling the power line frequency (patches 2/7 to 7/7)."" Which again seems to be a new feature (supporting ""UVC 1.5 power line frequency control extra option"").

In any case, yet another example of how definition of what is in-specs and what is off-specs is fundamental to decide if a commit is fixing a bug or adding new functionality.
