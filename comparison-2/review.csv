974d5ef0dd,jesus,4,True,0,3,0,0,2,"It doesn't seem like a bug fix, since it only removes a lock which apparently is not needed. So it would be more like a perfective commit (or cleaning up things). To some extent it could be preventing future errors (so, it could be a bpc)."
e2d8ea4320,jesus,4,True,0,0,0,0,,"It does not seem to fix a bug, it just changes the log level."
d7d7ddc156,jesus,2,True,0,2,0,0,2,"The commit has specific terminology which makes it difficult to be sure that I understand the commit. However, my understanding is that it doesn't fix a bug, but improves the code (so, a perfective commit, and maybe a bpc). However, it could have implications for safety, because it deals with locks, which could have an impact in correct scheduling and parallel access."
b1c87b0874,jesus,3,True,1,3,0,0,3,"Instead of resetting a queue, unmaps all queues, apparently to prevent possible breakage of the CP scheduler. So, it seems it is more like a preventive action, preventing a possible bug. It could have an impact on safety, because that potential bug in the scheduler. I'm not labeling it as 4 in bpc because I'm not completely sure of the meaning of the commit."
088604d37e,jesus,3,False,0,2,0,0,2,"It seems that in certain cases, disabling forced threading is not needed. The patch avoids that disabling in that case. So, it is more a perfective commit than anything else: it doesn't seem that a bug is fixed, or prevented. But I'm not completely sure I understand the commit, maybe I'm missing something. I see one annotator thinks that the removed flag ""should be"" removed, but it is the one who doesn't think it is a bfc. Apparently, the others, who think it is a bfc, maybe think it is nothing necessary (or I misinterrpet their comments)."
e6fc9f62ce,jesus,2,False,1,3,0,0,2,"I'm not sure I understand the commit message. It seems it is not fixing a bug, but improving the code. But the references to ""len_ptr points to a shared unsigned int"" could mean that it should be disallowed, and in that case it would be fixing a possible future bug. So, I'm labeling it as false bfc, true bpc, but not much sure about that."
d2ed913b9a,jesus,3,True,0,3,4,0,2,"sparse is a semantic checker, https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.9/dev-tools/sparse.html So, this is clearly an asc. It doesn't seem to be a bfc. It could be a bpc, but it is not clear to me exactly how. It is clearly a commit to increase quality of the code."
3648bcf1c1,jesus,4,True,0,0,0,0,0,"The commit just increases the max size of some queues. It doesn't seem directly related to a bug, but more like something due to a change in requirements, or a new feature."
fbb1d4b381,jesus,3,False,0,3,0,0,3,"Complex comment, but it seems like a refactoring to me, with no bug fix directly implied, although it could prevent some errors."
4528668ca3,jesus,4,True,0,3,0,0,3,"It seems like a preventive fix to me, but not a direct bug fix."

f3d6c538c3,jesus,4,True,4,0,0,0,0,"This seems to fix a bug: a error message should not be printed in some circumstances, and the patch avoids it. However, this is an interesting case: to which extent printing a ""error"" message is actually a bug? Two of the annotators thought it is not."
7f1f481263,jesus,2,False,1,1,0,0,2,"I think this is an interesting case, for which we would need somebody with better understanding of the kernel. It seems to be one of 12 patches. Even when it seems it adds a needed check, that can be a part of some extra functionality those 12 patches are adding, and not a real bug fix (in the sense it does not fix a bug already present in the system before those 12 patches were introduced). It is interesting too that with the same understanding of the commit, there is so much difference in categorizing as bfc or nor. In any case, if something that could be fixing a bug is introduced with the same code that introduces it (because it is really new functionality, and the code ""fixing a bug"" only makes sense with the new functionality), should we consider it as a bfc or not?"
d111c9f034,jesus,1,False,2,2,0,0,2,"This is an interesting case of merge commits. It merges three patches, apparently in a single commit. The information about the patches is very summarized, and it is difficult to know if any of them are really bug fixes or not.  I think we need somebody with better knowledge about the kernel to know what to do with this kind of commit, and how to find more info about it."
0fb3436b4b,jesus,4,False,0,0,0,0,0,"Refactoring. In fact, the commit seems to be a part of a refactoring effort, with this specific change being the consequence of no longer using a certain API. Again, this is an interesting case: given that the API now is different, this fixes an error. But in fact, it is due to a deprecation refactorization, and the set of commits seems just to be a refactoring. So, it is not not actually a bfc, or anything related to a bug, except if we consider that the refactoring is causing bugs in the calling code."
4dc73c6791,jesus,4,False,4,0,0,0,4,"This seems to be fixing a bug that happens when you need to start the state-manager thread , and there is no memory for it. So, it would be fixing that bug. "
4d7d4c3fc1,jesus,4,False,0,3,0,0,3,"Interesting case, since there is no comment, just the one-line header of the commit comment. It seems it is moving some assembler to the text section, for PARISC (looking for info, it is a read-only section intended for code, as opposed to the data section which is read-write. This could mean that it is trying to prevent security and/or safety rirks, but that's difficult to evaluate for me. It seems clear it is not actually fixing a known bug. I could say that I understand the commit, but not its implications."
4058f74210,jesus,4,True,0,0,0,0,0,"Yet another example of ""is this a bug""? Apparently, there was no place in the data structure for files in netfs for the size of the file in the remote server, and this patch adds it. This could be considered as a bug fix, but also as new functionality. In this case, I tend to consider it as the second, but I see arguments for the first."
689fafd5b5,jesus,4,True,0,0,0,0,0,"This seems like a commit using a new feature in some hw, which was unused (and labels as unsupported) up to now. It seems to be a part of a patchset switching to that new functionality. If I'm correct, this is new functionality (or maybe new requirements), not a bug fix."
6a34fdcca4,jesus,3,True,0,0,0,0,0,"Apparently, a merge commit with new functionality. This seems, in fact, to be the main commit of 689fafd5b5, so same comments apply. Since several things are touched by this merge (all of them apparently new functionality, for supporting a new RTC feature for some hw), this also raises the problem of what to do with merge commits (maybe considering them as a special thing?) In fact, the previous commit (689fafd5b5)  seems to be included here, so maybe the most sensible thing is to just do not annotate merge commits. "
73924ec4d5,jesus,4,False,0,0,0,0,0,"This seems like a perfective commit, improving performance. For example: ""This is not optimal,..."""
7e8906dc26,jesus,4,False,0,0,0,0,0,"Yet another interesting case. This is an assert, apparently for checking that a break in the code is not taken. But due to some new functionality/refactoring, this branch could be taken now. So, I think this is the result of new functionality / requirements, and not really a bug fix. But it could also be considered as a bug fix if the new situation causes the assert to be incorrectly hit."
453096eb04,jesus,3,True,4,2,0,0,4,"Yet another case of a merge commit. It seems to include some bug fixes, some with safety implications."

8ddffdb944,jesus,4,True,4,0,0,0,0,"Fixes, for IPv6, a bug which was already fixed for IPv4. Quite difficult to say if it affects safety: it could be, if the affected packet has safety implications."
