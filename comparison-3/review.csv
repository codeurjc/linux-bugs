5b2c5540b8,jesus,4,True,4,0,3,0,0,3,0,,,"INFO. This would be a bug fixing commit if we consider that errors returned by BPF are the same to be returned by the ""real"" stack (such as TCP). Of course, we could also consider this is also a matter of opinion, and this is just a perfective commit, trying to take BPF closer to the communication stack (in this case, at the level or error reporting). This is an interesting case of ""being a BFC or not would depend on whether what is considered to be the specification"". If the specification were ""errors should be like those of the TCP/IP stack"", this would be a bug. I'm considering that's the case. But if there is no specification as such, this would be just a perfective commit, making things more ""reasonable"", and more like they were in the past (it seems that was the situation previous to some commit). And could signal a change in specifications (or more likely, an extension of the specifications to address this case). This is also part of a patchset, but it seems it is independent from other patches in it."

It ""adds a field to /proc/pid/maps and /proc/pid/smaps to show a userspace-provided name for anonymous vmas"". I think two of the reviewers didn't understood the commit, and that's why they said it is close to a BFC. This is a good example of a new feature, which is extending specifications (vmas should have a field for a userspace-provided name), which is introduced at the same time the patch is committed."

It is even unlikely that the ""fixed"" config is used at all. However, it avoids an error in that case, so this could be a bug fixing commit. So, I label this as a BFC, but it could also be a BPC (if it is considered that this didn't really trigger a bug), or even (maybe) a NFC (if consider that configuration is now considered)."

This is considered as a bug fix by the author (it is part of a patchset which reads ""This patch series contains various fixes for pci-mvebu.c driver. Only bugfixes, no new features."" But it doesn't really refer to a bug. It seems more like preventing future bugs.  There is no evidence the code is being called in a way that ""invalid size"" actually happens. So, I label it as a BPC. However, it could be a BFC if we consider this is fixing a possible bug (or if a bug were reported about this matter).

e973746882,jesus,4,False,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,False,"INFO. The discussion in LORE [1] shows what is actually happening. The fix avoids confusion when calling the kernel API from userspace. Before the patch, information provided by the kernel could be contradictory, now it is isn't. Now, the question is: does this make it a BFC, a BPC, or something else? In addition, this is in the context of commit ""690a757d610e (""kvm: x86: Add CPUID support for Intel AMX"")"" (which is mentioned in the Fixes field). In other words, some new functionality was added, but it could provide contradictory info to userspace, so that is fixed. Apparently, no bug was reported. However, it seems the spec was that the information should not be contradictory, thus this would be fixing a non-reported bug. Labeling as BFC because of that.

1ac7fd8159,jesus,4,False,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,"INFO. Interesting case of a commit that could be considered a BFC, or a NFC. Apparently, some families of Intel processors use a new format for some CPU registers (LBR). LBR stands for ""last branch records"", and apparently is a hw mechanism provided by some Intel CPUs to collect information about the call graph, which can be used by performance profilers [1] [2]. It seems that in some of the latest Intel families, some information about missprediction could be lost. The commit fixes this. I'm considering it as a bug fixing commit, because it seems those Intel families are within specs at the moment the commit is written, and providing the right info is also within specs. But it is important to notice that likely those families were not within specs when the fixed code was written, so this could also be considered just as a NFC, adding the feature of supporting these Intel families with respect to performance statistics.

In this case, some of the annotators labeled the commit as PRC, likely because performance was mentioned (but this is, afaik, about performance stats, not performance itself).

It seems that in certain cases, a component is not getting the right error information. The commit fixes it. So, it seems to be a BFC (if we consider that passing the right error info is part of the specs). If passing the right error information is not considered a part of the specs, this could be a PRC (which is what two of the annotators did). I'm not sure about implications for safety: labeling as 0 since I don't see any, anyway.

16b1941eac,jesus,4,True,4,0,0,0,4,0,0,3,False,"INFO. This seems like a clear BFC, triggered by an automated tool (A fuzzer). It could be a safety-related bug, since a variable is used after being freed, which in principle could have unintended consequences.

This said, it is interesting this sentence in the commit message: ""The race wouldn't occur if the gadget core registered its devices on a real bus, using the standard synchronization techniques of the driver core."" Reading the complete message, the bug manifests in the gadget core (this is in the USB subsystem) because it is not using the ""standard synchronization techniques provided by the driver core"". However, the bug is fixed not in the gadget core, but in the driver core, thus preventing bugs caused by other gadgets that could not be using those standard techniques."
0a3a4b9d2b,jesus,4,True,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,True,"INFO. A variable is increased in size, to hold more elements (in this case, number of timer interrupts, if I understand it well). I think we can assume the previous value (10) was good enough when the code was written, being therefore a part of the specs at that time (no more than 10 timer interrupts). But with time, this become too small, and needed to be extended (both in the specs, and in the code). This is also drawn from the sentence: ""Which restrict the scalability of the MCT driver for the SoC which has more local timers interrupts"", which seems to imply that to gain scalability to allow for SoC, with more timer interrupts (thus, extending specs to consider them), the size needs to be enlarged. Thus, I consider this really as a NFC, and a change in specs (but the change in specs could happen earlier, which these kind of devices were included in the specs for the kernel).

If we consider that the specs were already changed earlier, and this is not just a commit to implement such specs, this would be a BFC. Which shows the importance of the changes in spec, and the ""intention"" of a commit (to implement a change in specs, which would be a NFC, or to fix a bug because specs changed and some part of the code is not adhering to them, which would be a BFC or maybe a BPC).

It is also interesting how a developer, in an answer [1], shows how there is no chance of having a problem, so this really only ""keeps the compiler happy"". Which reinfrces the idea that this is a BPC.

Looking at the message describing the patchset [1], this is in fact v4 of the patchset which included the new functionality. Therefore, it would be a NCF, if not because it seems that V4 was accepted into the kernel, even when problems with it were found later, and that's the reason for V5 and V6 (which is produced as a delta against V4, which is already in the kernel).

In summary: some new functionality is added to the kernel (V4), bug is later found with problems, so this V6 is produced (and later accepted). It doesn't seem this patch fixes any specific bug, but clearly addresses a problem with severe potential consequences, thus a BPC (with an impact on safety).

daeb1c2b50,jesus,3,True,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,True,"INFO. This seems to be a bug preventing commit: ""The pin controller device node is expected to have one (optional) interrupt. [...] Exynos850 defined the second part - interrupt for each pin in wake-up pin controller - but also added these interrupts in main device node, which is not correct."" Therefore, no specific malfunction is described, but the mapping of interrupts was not correct. It could be a BFC if we consider this fixes a bug, but in fact it seems to be mostly a bug preventing action, or even a perfective action, since there is no description of specific problems caused. I'm labeling it as BPC, since a user of this code could think it can select the interrupt in the device node, which would trigger the bug (I think).

Interesting case of a commit where we all have different opinions on how to classify, even when we have at least a general understanding about what is happening. Maybe we could need a kernel developer to explain further this commit, and its consequences?

Also, labeling it a safety-related, because it could happen, if I understand it well, that the wake-up int is needed, but it is connected to the wrong interrupt (in the main device node)."

Tow annotators classified this as PRC, but I don't see the reason. Maybe because ""core"" functionality is not changed? (I mean, if we consider that these functions that are intended to print messages are not really part of the ""core"" functionality.

Curiously enough, none of the annotators classified it this way.

f93e2a100e,jesus,4,True,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,4,False,"Preventive commit. No bug is reported, but it seems reasonable to check the return of kzalloc just in case it returns null (in which case the function should return directly). This should allow to catch this situation in the future, by ensuring null is returned instead of the function trying to do something wrong."
5f24d5a579,jesus,4,False,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,False,"INFO This commit fixes a problem that happens in ARM, but not in other archs. Apparently, when the functionality for huge address spaces was added, it was not taken into account completely how ARM does it. Thus, this is fixing that bug (which would prevent that functionality working properly for ARM). Thus, this is a BFC. Alternatively, if we think that the original implementation specs didn't include ARM, this would be a NFC. But that doesn't seem to be the case.

I think annotators didn't completely understood this commit, or understood it differently."

It seems no specific error is fixed, but potential bugs are prevented. Thus, BPC. In addition, a reason for these changes is avoiding some warnings (an automated suggestion), thus this is also an ASC.

It could also be a perfective commit, if we consider it does not prevent bugs, but I think that's not the case (or my understanding of the code is not that deep to realize that)."
