5b2c5540b8,jesus,4,True,4,0,3,0,0,3,0,,,"INFO. This would be a bug fixing commit if we consider that errors returned by BPF are the same to be returned by the ""real"" stack (such as TCP). Of course, we could also consider this is also a matter of opinion, and this is just a perfective commit, trying to take BPF closer to the communication stack (in this case, at the level or error reporting). This is an interesting case of ""being a BFC or not would depend on whether what is considered to be the specification"". If the specification were ""errors should be like those of the TCP/IP stack"", this would be a bug. I'm considering that's the case. But if there is no specification as such, this would be just a perfective commit, making things more ""reasonable"", and more like they were in the past (it seems that was the situation previous to some commit). And could signal a change in specifications (or more likely, an extension of the specifications to address this case). This is also part of a patchset, but it seems it is independent from other patches in it."
9a10064f56,jesus,4,False,0,0,0,4,0,4,0,0,,"INFO. This seems to me clearly as a new feature. It ""adds a field to /proc/pid/maps and /proc/pid/smaps to show a userspace-provided name for anonymous vmas"". I think two of the reviewers didn't understood the commit, and that's why they said it is close to a BFC. This is a good example of a new feature, which is extending specifications (vmas should have a field for a userspace-provided name), which is introduced at the same time the patch is committed."
016017a195,jesus,4,True,4,2,0,1,0,0,4,0,False,"INFO. Interesting case: a ""not real"" configuration case (a non-useful configuration for compiling the kernel) is fixed in this commit. It is even unlikely that the ""fixed"" config is used at all. However, it avoids an error in that case, so this could be a bug fixing commit. So, I label this as a BFC, but it could also be a BPC (if it is considered that this didn't really trigger a bug), or even (maybe) a NFC (if consider that configuration is now considered)."
11c2bf4a20,jesus,4,True,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,True,"INFO. This is considered as a bug fix by the author (it is part of a patchset which reads ""This patch series contains various fixes for pci-mvebu.c driver. Only bugfixes, no new features."" But it doesn't really refer to a bug. It seems more like preventing future bugs.  There is no evidence the code is being called in a way that ""invalid size"" actually happens. So, I label it as a BPC. However, it could be a BFC if we consider this is fixing a possible bug (or if a bug were reported about this matter).
